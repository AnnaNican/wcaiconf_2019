MICHAEL SINGER 
by Diane Waldman 



The first sculptures by Michael Singer to receive major exposure were exhibited at the Guggenheim 
Museum in Ten Young Artists: Theodoron Awards in 1971 (cat. nos. 1,2). They consisted of steel or 
milled wood beams placed in delicate, precarious balance. Although the works seemed casual in 
construction, the equilibrium upon which they were based was the result of thoughtful deliberation, 
experimentation and change. These apparently contradictory characteristics have continued to 
preoccupy Singer over a thirteen-year span, during which time he has produced an impressive body 
of indoor and outdoor sculpture, an accomplished series of drawings, site-related photographs and, 
most recently, a portfolio of etchings and lithographs. 

Central to the development of Singer's sculpture has been an exploration of the principles of 
balance, movement and of the nature of materials. As I stated in the lexl accompanying the Theo- 
doron exhibition: 

To maintain a stable position in a straightforward manner. Singer has aligned a series of individual 
units into constructions in which each segment is mutually interdependent on every other one. The 

work is complicated to a further degree: nearly all his sculptures have the capacity for movement: 
as a result a potential for disorder is imminent since no two poised elements are joined together. 
Although Singer uses a number of different materials — wood, steel, rattan, etc. — he manipulates 
them all to conform to a common vision. He imbues a weighty, solid material like steel with properties 
of flexibility and lightness, thus making it appear no heavier than the rattan, whereas the rattan 
seems equal in weight to the steel. 

The act of motion within a single piece necessitates the presence of a participant ... [possibly] a 
mere chance situation in which the piece is touched accidentally, for example, by the wind. II- 
though the weight is evenly distributed, any overly forceful action can threaten the controlled state 
of equilibrium,... With the introduction of motion there is a heightened awareness of the nature 
of the material — as it is and as it is transformed into another context through a transcendence 
of the medium. ' 

The work ol these formative years evolved out ol the Minimalist aesthetic, which then dominated 
advanced artistic circles. The cool aloofness thai characterized Minimalism is epitomized by Carl 
Andre's floor- related pieces and Robert Morris's equally understated pale plywood sculptures. Sub- 
sequently, Richard Serra challenged the Minimalist disengagement ol sculpture from spectator bv 
proposing a more direct confrontation between viewer and object in his lead-prop pieces. The in- 
fluence of Minimalism is visible in Singer's work in his choice of such materials as steel, bricks or 
milled wood and in his reliance on these materials to dictate form. Yet Singer's sculpture lacked the 
extremely rational ordering, the uniform emphasis and stability that characterized Andre's floor 
pieces and Morris's sculpture, and the sootv, griltv aggressiveness of Sena's more Flamboyant work.

Vlread) discernable in Singer's art of thai period was an interest in issues thai would clearly distin- 
guish Ins st\le trom the reductivist mode ot the Minimalists &lt;&gt;l \ndre's and Morris's generation ol 
the mid- l'Mids. which filtered down into the work of Sena and his colleagues. It was evidenl thai 
Silver differed not onlv from his immediate predecessors hut also from his contemporaries sin h as 
George Trakas, Alice Ay-cock and Man Miss, whose work was architectonic, and other artists whose 
overriding emphasis on gesture resulted in the virtual exclusion ol formal considerations. Clearly 

Singer shared with other young sculptors an interest in material and pro( ess. | lowever, his ai lite 

feeling for form, his striving to achieve the essence of simplicity, the poetii evocation of an art, which, 

even m its earliest stages, questioned the validity ol an expression based exi lusively on aestheth 

issues and SOUghl to resolve the contradictions among man. culture and nature, set his work apart 
and mark it as unique.

words, as level as water. These emphaticall) Hat pieces, set directl) on the ground, identified the

Action Painting of the late 1910s and the 1950s. More typical of Serra's works of the period were 
his lead-prop pieces in which gravity, balance and wall and floor planes were integral compositional 
elements (li^. 5). I le used materials such as lead antimony whose raw look and malleability, which 
enabled him to roll planar configurations into curved or tubular forms, offsel an otherwise unyielding

lake Serra. Singer chose to balance his pieces tenuously. I lowever, because Singer's sculptures 
rest fairly (lose to the floor, the element of danger present in Sena's work is virtually nonexistent. 
Singer's interest in balance appears to have been stimulated not only by Sena's example but also to 
have evolved in response to issues that had been confronted by many Iwcnlietb-cenlurv sculptors.

(fig. 7). and Andre's floor-hugging brick and metal-plate pieces of the mid- 1960s. In the late 1960s 
and carls 1970s, as artists redefined sculpture, balance, propping, stacking and alignment were 
among the means the) favored to articulate form. Thus, in his earl) work Balance \\H . Spring l'*7l 

(cat. no. 1 ). Singer uses stacked lead fire-bricks as the support structure lor his milled wooden beams; 
these, in turn, are counterbalanced In additional bricks that act as weights to stabilize the sculpture. 

For a young artist like Singer the period of the kite I'lbils to earl) l ( )70s represented both an vm\ 
and a beginning: the rational, formalist approach was winding down, giving way to an idiosyncratic, 
highl) subjective vision. \n antiformalist attitude towards materials and structure predominated 111 
young artistic circles. Largel) abandoned, or so it appeared, were mam ot the issues th.it engaged 
sculptors during the 1950s: the articulation of figure and base, of truth to materials, of appropri- 
ateness of sculpture to place. Wood. lead, rubber, rope, cotton batting, Masonite, fabric, barbed wire, 
leaves, hemp, gravel, ashes, sandbags, were scattered, strewn, random K assembled on the one hand, 
or propped, stacked, aligned into a semblance of architectonic order on the other. 

1 low ever. Singer was from the outset more selective than most voun^ artists of the period m his 
choice of materials. \nd his evident sense of the appropriateness of his materials came from an 
understanding ot place. In New ^iork. where he lived and worked on the Lower Kast Side. wood. 
steel and brick seemed most fitting for pieces related to an urban setting. Yel other materials — 
rattan and bamboo — fascinated him as well. Singer recalls iism^; rattan and bamboo as earl) as 
1 ( )(&gt; ( ). Inspired bv his direct experience of the saltwater marshes of Long Island, where he grew up. 
and National Geographic articles about Thor Heyerdahl and the people of Lake Titicaca, Peru, 
Singer began to assemble grasses from the marshes and truck them to the studio. 

Singer explains: 

Heyerdahl theorized that ancient Egyptians mid Peruvians took ocean voyages in enormous reed 
boats. I lis theory is partly based on the [net that both of these cultures built similar papy rus bout-,. 

It was tin' reeds that fascinated me. I wanted to gather reeds and hunch them a\ a material to look 
at in the studio. In available reed in this region is phragmites, which I gathered from the Long 
Island saltwater marshes. I used jute rope to hind thick and thin hum lies of /he reeds 

Singer located the bamboo and rattan he needed lor his experiments in warehouses in \evv x mk 
and New Jersey. He speaks of the seminal importance of his encounter with the story of Heyerdahl's 
journe) across the Vtlantic in a reed boat and the desi upturn ol the Peruvian i ulture 

There is a remarkable harmony between the people of Lake Titicaca, Peru, and their environment

these reeds. Their houses, boats and food suppb also come from these reeds, then mythology reflects 
their dependence on the reeds and the enormous lake I wanted to understand this kind of harmonious 

relationship of vision and life-style &lt;»/ " ( ulture to its environment. I "&gt; 



Works such as Balance XXIV are very much about the city and the barriers, grids and confined 
spaces that typify an urban environment. Yet Singer's use of rattan and bamboo and the tripod forms 
he created with these plants in the 1970s clearly indicate that he was not entirely satisfied with the 
city as a source of inspiration or with materials appropriate to an urban site. 

The questioning of his situation was in part inspired by his contact with Allan Kaprow, who had 
come to Cornell in the spring of 1964, during Singer's freshman year at the university. During the 
late 1950s and early 1960s, Kaprow had a wide artistic influence, generating ideas and sparking 
experimentation in a variety of media. Singer performed in one of Kaprow's most notable 1 lappen- 
ings, "Household": he was so impressed with Kaprow that he received permission to leave Cornell 
during his junior year to study with the artist at Stony Brook University on Long Island. Kaprow 
subsequently introduced Singer to Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell. While he greatly admired 
all three, Singer recognized that their direction was not his own. However. Kaprow represented an 
alternative to formalists such as Mondrian and Giacometti, whom he had studied at college, and to 
painting, which he had pursued as an undergraduate. And ultimately it was the example of Kaprow, 
who continually experimented, who was concerned with chance, with time, with process and ma- 
terials rather than with the finite object, that prompted Singer to remove himself from an art world 
and a city he found stifling and distracting to the seclusion of the country. 

Although Singer continued to maintain his own loft on the Lower Last Side, he established his 
primary residence in a small town in Vermont in 1971. Singer's approach to his new environment 
was tentative. He began by placing one of the large steel balance sculptures he had brought from 
New York in the fields near his rented house. Then he started to alter the configurations of the piece 
Singer recalls: 



■i-^ 1 



I found myself making changes and then looking at the work through a camera. It dawned on me 
that I needed the camera to re-create the framework of the w&lt;dls of my city studio and that I was 
being strongly influenced by the urban vision and experience that I had just left. 

It was an important lesson for me to realize that in this different natural environment vision isn't 
blocked, there are no grids. In the pastoral (aid wooded landscape of I ermont, vistas open to valleys 
and mountains, and it's the atmosphere that veils and reveals the hills over great distances. It was 
this natural environment that I wanted to understand. 

In Singer's first years &lt;&gt;l living away from the city he was primarily preoccupied with two envi- 
ronments: the beaver bogs (cat. no. ()) in Marlboro, Vermont, where he worked from 1971 to 1971. 
and the saltwater marshes of Long Island. I hiring the three winters Singer worked in the bogs, he 
observed the ecology of the site and die work patterns ol the heavers there, and his sculpture resulted 
Id from his consideration of the shifting forces of nature. As he says: 



In the bog the working material was the trees. I cut &lt;lc&lt;ul trees and rigged n/&gt; all kinds of devices to 
move them through the woods, to build a structure with them. The guiding principle of these struc- 
tures uas balance. Each "situation" would be completed when the set of trees, leaning on one another. 
uas balanced to a point of weightlessness, a point where, through the use of stumps r/s fulcrums. 
one could gently touch a part of this structure and feel the entire assemblage move. 

I wanted this to look accidental, unintended, as though a work oj nature. There ivu\ to be no human 
presence: perhaps because I was still trying to understand what my own presence in this natural 
environment should be. I cut trees so they would split as though a windfall caused such an occurrem e. 
I painted many of the cut ends to conceal the whiteness of the raw wood. It became an absolute rule 
that there should be no sign of human presence. Part of my obsession about the absence of humans 
in these works came from the shame I felt about being part of a culture that has systematically 
destroyed the natural environment. Western culture views man at the top. controlling nature, apart 
from it. 1 1 hen nature is conquered, confined, controlled, man is safe. In order to experience and learn 
from the natural environment I felt the need to yield to it. respect it. to observe, learn and then work 
with it. This early rule that I had. to not allow my presence in the work, was helpful in this yielding 
and learning process. Eventually I accepted my role m the environment as more than observer, 
manager, researcher. I understood this roll 1 as an artist. 

Singer remained committed to the concept of working alone in nature. Although it now appears 
rudimentan in view ol his recent development, tliis work brought him into Ins first direcl contact 
with nature. IK accepting nature and its innate laws, he was allowing the surroundings to act on 
him rather than imposing himself on the environment. In this important resped alone he differed 
from many of his contemporaries who, working within the idiom of Earthworks, had simply imposed 
studio-related art onto the landsi ape. These sculptures eventual!) predicted the works that weir to 
come. More importantly, making them gave Singer an opportunity to learn about his materials and 
a chance to work out process in a private rather than public context. 

During the period he worked in the hea\er bog, Singer also studied the saltwater marshes ol 

Long Island. Mere he was intense!) involved w nh the vastness of the space .n\t\ with the ecological 
patterns of the marsh in relation to the life cycle of the area. \lread\ apparent was the concern with 

ritual and Oriental prototypes thai was to remain a major preoc i iift.it The sense of balance and 

peace, the spiritual aura of the works evokes Far Eastern sources and ritual objects. Vs he had earlier 

formed grasses into hunches in his studio, now he shaped bundles ol phragmites (marsh reedsl into 

curves; these he set into bamboo structures that he placed like totemii markers 111 the great open 
landscape. The structures were positioned so the) c aught the ever-&lt; hanging patterns ol light thai 
moved across the landscape. Singer note's that the "strui lures be&lt; ame instruments foi me in watt h 

and learn ahoul m\ relationship to this pi 



IK 



That Singer is concerned with the different qualities of light and materials specific to individual 
sites is indicated by his deliberate decision to work in Vermont and Long Island, two very different 
locations. This concern is manifested also in the variations he has introduced into pieces executed 
in a number of other places. He responded to both the materials and climates of each area. Thus 
in the beaver bogs of Marlboro or in Saratoga Springs, New York (where he executed Ritual Balance 
Scries [cat. no. 11] during July 1975 as his first commission for a public site). Singer worked with 
indigenous materials such as hemlock. The massive configurations of these pieces are appropriate 
to the rugged terrains and extreme climatic conditions prevalent there. For Balance Ritual Scries 
(cat. no. 8), executed in Coral Gables, Florida, in the winter of 1972-75, he used bamboo, which he 
located growing on private property. The Florida sequence is similar to the pieces conceived for the 
saltwater marshes, as the bamboo is more supple than hemlock; both the materials and the climate 
that supports them occasioned a more fragile, attenuated linearity than that dictated by northern 
materials and locations. The bamboo and reed works are like drawings in the landscape and resulted 
in a rather complex piece, Marsh Ritual Series (cat. no. 9), which he produced in October of 1975 
for Heckscher State Park on Long Island. Marsh Ritual Series is comprised of fourteen units of 
phragmites and bamboo scattered across an approximately fifty-acre saltwater marsh. The elements 
were barely visible in the generous expanse of the landscape, but the spectator slowly began to 
discern the individual parts and then to perceive the whole, and the work was ultimatel) and cu- 
mulatively impressive. Although the piece was destroyed by a storm shortly after completion, it was 
important for Singer: working on it he was more involved with learning about nature's processes 
than with creating a finite piece for a temporal situation. Fquallv significant, it gave rise lo Ritual 
Series 12/21/71 (cat. no. 10), the first of an impressive body of drawings. 

Singer's drawings, like his sculptures, evoke both nature and ritual. The early drawings, especially 
Ritual Series, 12/21/73 and the others that directly followed the Marsh Ritual Series, are, like the 
sculptures, spare in their configurations; they capture the essential delicacj of the marsh reeds, the 
linear grace and fluidity ol bamboo and the feeling ol the light, air and space ol the sites that inspired 
both bodies of work. In the drawings, as in his sculptures. Singer refers lo actual passages in the 
landscape — to a stand ol trees, a pond, the saltwater marshes — as well as lo more intangible, 
epheiner.il phenomena — haze, mist, smoke, rain, eddies, rushing water, tides — and lo I he seasons 
themselves. I le also occasionally alludes lo the process ol working — a motif, lor example, anchors 

a scries ol images lo the page at the same lime il evokes an axe shape bill his vocabulary ol forms 

springs from his feelings about nature rather than from a need lo describe il. In this respecl. h 
images recall those of Arshile Gorkj whose landscape drawings reveal the niyslerv and magic, the 
poetry of the natural world. As (iorky began lo "look into the grass,'' lo observe in minute delail 
the forms of flowers, leaves, insects, lo watch the wind as it ruffled the tall grasses, to feel the heat, 
the sun, the shadows, so Singer has experienced the elements ol nature, lake Gorky, who elicited 
from nature a new vocabulary ol forms, Singer is shaping Ins own verv personal bod\ of images. 



s 



Tlit' two artists share a passion for revealing the underlying forces and elemental forms of nature. 
(Jorkv's imagery, however, is Surrealist-inspired; his explorations of nature and inner states ol ex- 
istence are laden with Freudian symbolism and erotic content. Singer's perceptions ol nature evolve 
from within himself and are given form through reference to Oriental culture and primitive ritual. 

Whereas Singer's Sculptures are all large scale, his drawings m.i\ he relatively small (less than 

two feel wide or high), medium in size (approximately fiftj In fort) inches) or huge extended hori- 
zontals or verticals (measuring forty-five l&gt;\ ninety-six inches in either direction). I le works with 
charcoal combined w ith chalk, paper collage and gouache on paper. Uthough the draw m^s are fluid 

and appear to he spontaneous, the) are in fact the result of prolonged deliberation and reworking. 
Indeed, the collage elements are made of drawings that have been ripped and (ill apart and pasted 
together again. The charcoal, chalk and gouache provide line, shape and color, while the layer ol 
collaged papers adds both a real three-dimensional element and an illusion of space. The vertical 
forms in the drawings, like those in the sculptures, evoke lotemic images as well as actual passages 
in the landscape. In addition to vertical forms. Singer frequentl) uses elliptical or oval shapes in 
conjunction with an active calligraphy, which has a superficial resemblance to Abstract Expressionist 
handling. \\ bile the drawings are sweeping and gestural and mav at first seem impetuous, thev are 
unified hv the same sure equilibrium thai prevails in the sculpture. For Singer's sense of measure 
and order is as fundamental to his work as is his need to capture the pulse of nature, the sense of 
the Heeling moment. 

During Januarj and February of 1975 Singer worked on the Glades Ritual Series l'&gt;7&gt; (cat no. 
I 5), an installation in the Everglades Nation, il Park m Florida. The site was a vast, open glades area, 
which was under water from Mav through November hut was drv enough to work in during the 
winter. Like parts of the Western Kedwood forests or the hush in Australia, il is &lt; onstanllv heset hv 
fire, which actuallv contributes to the ecological balance of the area. Ill fact, .1 bnishfire had swept 
through the area shortlv before Singer began to work there. The fire had left the grass I haired and 
the limestone ground visihle. alterations in the environment that ultimate!) were reflected in his 
work, hi addition, water erosion caused sinkholes to appear in the limestone, and Singer used these 
holes to dictate where he plaice I his bamboo structure. The Glades Ritual Series t97S was the most 
successfull) resolved of Singer's land-related works to that date, for it captures the ephemeralit) ol 

nature and ol its materials (phragmites, pile rope and hamh I stands in complete li.n no &gt;n\ 

with the landscape in which it e\isis. I [ere for the Inst time the artist sited his work in a parti&lt; ular 

direction, lie oriented the piece on an east-west axis, will ess from the wist \s a result, the 

Spectator's point of View and pen eption ol light was i out rolled: when seen in the morning the work 

was bai kht: hv the end of dav it was full) illuminated. 

Singer observed the Everglades site during the summei before he worked on the Glades Ritual 
Series 1975. The landsi ape reflections he saw in the ponds ( reated hv the summei floods inspired 

him to seek a new situation lot his outdool s ( nipt lire. The result ol this quest is the I il\ Pond III /mil 



Series 7/75 (cat. no. 18), an extended horizontal piece he built in Harriman State Park in New York 
in July 1975. Like Balance XXIV and Centering Balance (cat. nos. 1,3), both 1971, the Lily Pond 
Bitnal Series 7/75 is about span, balance, horizontally and place. Although it is approximately eighty- 
five-feet long, the construction seems modest in relation to the very large pond, the extravagant 
foliage that rims it and the equally extravagant shadows cast in the water. And like the Marsh Ritual 
Series, 1975, and the Sangam Ritaal Series 4/76, 1976 (cat. nos, 9,19), it is so understated that it 
seems to merge with the landscape. Only after prolonged viewing is the spectator able to isolate the 
delicate tracery of the structure from its surroundings. Singer has remarked that the work of the 
mid- to late- 1970s illuminates the environment for him and for the spectator, for the sculpture 
reveals itself as the result of our perception of the landscape. 

Other equally successful works of the period are the First Gate Ritual Series of 197b (cat. no. 21), 
an installation for the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art in Roslyn, New York, and a similar piece 
of the same title made for the Docurnenta 6 of 1977. Both are two-part constructions that elaborate 
upon line, light and reflections. And probably because their park settings are more cultivated and 
their ponds more distinct in shape than Singer usually chooses, both seem more substantial and 
more independent than the earlier work. As Singer began to work in public locations, aware thai 
his pieces would be seen for long periods of time, he became increasingly concerned with their 
durability and with access to them. This represented a substantial departure from his earlier attitude, 
wherein the human presence was not considered and the works were the basis lor private experiences 
between artist and nature. In his use of oak and rock here, the artist is introducing materials that 
presage a new direction in his work. Yet the two-part pieces retain a characteristic sense of equilib- 
rium that mediates between the shifting forces of the water as well as an equilibrium sustained by 
the thrusts and counterthrusts within the work. More important, the configurations of these two 
sculptures recall ancient Egyptian and Peruvian reed boats and thus pay homage to the culture that 
inspired both I leyerdahl and Singer himself. 

Singer notes that stones and bricks were used exclusively to counterbalance the other elements 
in the works of the early 1970s. Later, in his first gallery piece, Ritual Balance Series I2/7S of 1975 
(cat. no. 17), for example, the stones are used both as foundation — as architectural elements — and 
as referents to the stones the beavers placed in their dam. The eroded, solt-edged bricks in the work 
suggest both architectural construction and the weathering process of nature. Singer elaborates on 
the increasingly complicated functions ol his materials: 

In the pieces between 1975 and 1980 I used stones as a foundation and as a structural element 
between the wooden beams (both curved and straight), helping to create the physical tension that 
held these wooden elements together. As these sculptures became more complex there was an am- 
biguity about whether the stone supported the wood or did the wood exist to support the stone. The 
20 interdependence of the two was physical — structural and visual. 



In later work such as First date Ritual Scries. 1980 (cat no. 36), shown in Zurich and at the 

Rinirliiiii Museum in Sarasota: 



'*-&gt;■ 



/The rocks/ become a presence apart from their structural Junction. The ambiguity between wood 

and stone lessens. The tcood clearly supports certain Stones. I sense these stones as symbols containing 
references to mountain, river, cloud, natural elements. 

I take long walks to look for stones that come from trails, fields and streams. Once I have the stones 
I place them in the studio where I spend a long tune determining which edges should be cut. I 
categorize the stones visually — vertical, horizontal, diagonal, round, sharp, weathered by the air. 
time honored 

Singer's outdoor sculpture has progressed through three distincl phases. I luring the first, which 

corresponded to the three \ears he worked in the beaver bogs in Marlboro and the Long bland 
saltwater marshes, he was preoccupied with working in. learning from and adapting to nature. 1 hiring 
the second he made pieces that helped him see nature and define place. Bj l')7 ( ) he was creating 
sculpture that was interdependent with place. Intimations of this interdependence are already present 
in Rog Ritual Series 6 78, a piece executed in a beaver bog in 1978 in Marlboro. However this harmonj 
was not lullv realized until First Gate Ritual Series 4 77. made tor DeWeese Park in Dayton I (at. no. 
28). Singer believes that the site pushed him further in ibis direction than he had gone before. It 
challenged him to integrate the experience of the beaver bogs with that of the saltwater marshes. 
With this piece he introduced phragmites and bamboo into a rugged terrain reminiscent ol the 
Vermont landscape. Singer's exploitation ol light, shadow. Ins sensitivity towards density, mass. 
volume, line, texture and color, both in the environment and in the forms he created made this bis 
most sin ccsslul outdoor work to thai date. 

Concurrent with his development ol outdoor sculpture. Singer concerned himself with indoor 
pieces. In two transitional pieces executed in his Now York studio in 1974-75 (cat nos. 13,1 ll. he 
attempted to readjust to the urn hanging confines ol the studio or galler\ without sacrificing the 
meaning ol the sculpture ol the lour preceding years 

In 1 ( )7~) he accomplished this readjustment when he created the above-mentioned Ritual Ralam e 
Series for the Greene Street space of the S p&lt; -rone Westwatei Fischer Gallery. This work. Sangam 
Ritual Series 7 77 of 1 ( )77 and First date Ritual Series in 78oi 1978 (&lt; at nos. 2(&gt;._&gt;7i were « on. eived 
for specific indoor sites. Ritual Balance Series was i ,i rein IK placed .md ht. with meticulous c on sid - 

eration of the specifics of the (ireene Street gallerj Spate. It was Singer's objective 1" allow the

the wall and floor planes and in the leanness of the construction, which was entire!) appropriate to 
the spareness of the gallery. The interplay of line and curve, of color and textures, the natural 
elements — wood, phragmites, bamboo and stones — and the configuration of the whole are gracefully 
accommodated to the space. I lowever, the piece was not a mere reflection of the interior, but was 
invested with a powerful spiritual aura, an independent magical presence. 

By the summer of 1979, consideration of mass and gravity began to replace the concern with the 
more temporal qualities of air, light, water in Singer's work. He remarks: 

At this time, and now, I notice the stone walls, stone outcroppings and ledge. I'm impressed with 
stories about how the settlers of this region straggled to clear the haul of the stones only to find more 
forced to the surface each war by winter frost. I observe the geology underlying nature's structures, 
the layering of the foundations of the earth, the deeper structures creating the contours. 

In keeping with the new emphasis on the permanent and enduring, stone began to replace marsh 
reeds and bamboo, and the foundations of the sculpture assumed a more significant role. First in 
the outdoor sculpture, later in the indoor, stone — ancient, lull ol historical and mythological as- 
sociations — became the symbol of the eternal. 

The ambiguity in the relationship between wood and stone that had existed in the earlier work 
gradually was eradicated, as the wood was shown clearly to support certain stones. In works of the 
early 1980s Singer constructed wooden platforms whose central function was to contain and em- 
phasize stones. The stones begin to lake on a significance beyond their structural meaning: they 
become symbols of natural elements — rocks, streams, cloud formations, hi Ritual Series SO SI, 1980- 
81 (cat. no. 40), the rocks have been selected and altered to enhance symbolic allusions. The most 
recent compositions are made entirely ol stone: they are denser and more complex than the pre\ ions 
work, yet retain the sense of balance and completeness of their precursors. 

Recently the drawings, as well as the sculptures, have become denser, more compact. There are 
I ewer references to illusionistic landscape depth, and energj seems to How closer to the picture plane. 
The earlier drawings are linear and open: space Hows Ireeh around forms and there is a sense of 
shallow three-dimensional space. I lorizonlal and vertical forms seem ordered into an allover pattern 
b\ an implied grid. Now, however, in the draw nii;s. as in the sculptures, there is a sense ol enclosure. 
Forms, which tend to be self-contained and isolated, are beginning to assume a ritualistic meaning, 
as Singer's vocabulary lakes on a new metaphorical quality. 

Apparent in the early as well as the recent drawings is Singer's painterly sensibility , w Inch reveals 

itsell in Ins v it tiiousiiv, Ins consummate ability to manipulate line, plane, straight edge and curve, 

to control thick and thin contour, gesture and color. Whereas slaleliness prevails in the sculpture, 

and the drawings are marked by immediacy and intimacy, the works ill the two mediums are linked 

22 by their characteristic thoughtfulness, More importantly they are unified by the absolute consistency 



of Singer's commitment to interpreting the majestic, immutable forms ol nature and its elemental, 
underlying forces. 

Singer has recently favored slate and granite. The inner core of First Gate Ritual Series 1982 (cat. 

no. f~) is slate and the outer structure and "natural" rocks or fieldstnnes are granite. The (loud 
Hands Ritual Series and Seven Worm Ritual Series, hoth 1983-84 (cover [foreground], cat. no. 1-8), 
are comprised entirelv ol granite: Cloud I lands is gra\ and white stone I nun Vermont; the exterior 

of Seven Moon is a dark, almost charcoal, graj rock from Pennsylvania (ailed "Mist"; the i 

structure is a light graj granite from Vermont. Shite results when layers ol silt containing vegetation 
and organisms are subjected to heat and pressure. The fossil materials an- obliterated during the 
process, hut leave trace-- in the form of streaks and imperfections. ( iranite is an igneous rock, formed 
from molten matter deep within the earth: its minerals crystallize as the rock cools. Singer has 
explained wh\ these rocks appeal to him. I le sa\s he chooses slate lor its innate layering, "because 
of the process that it has gone through, it seems like a rock that is more 'alive.'" I low ever, for Singer, 
"granite is the most enduring and stable stone. It is this quiet, serene sense ili.u attracts me." 

I larmonj and order, simplicity and balance inform the granite and slate sculptures, .is lhe\ do

a simplicity and equilibrium that is at odds with hoth the characteristics of the sculpture of his peers 
and with the nature ot the cit\ . Central to all his work too has been a powerful sense of ritual and 
myth, which serves to unifj Ins allusions to man and nature. That Singer's objective is to capture a 
feeling ol the rituals ol nature is indicated in his discussion ol the (Hades Ritual Scncw

ritualistic significance. This idea is reflected in Ins titles — not onlj Glades Ritual Series hut also 
Sangam Ritual Series of l ( )7i). whic h refers to a site in India where a shrine marks the jun&lt; lion ol 
rivers. Beginning with works such as First date Ritual Series of 1979 and 1980 (see cat nos. 32,38), 
Singer saw mythic connotations in the landsi ape; later, in indoor sculptures ol 1982 su&lt; h as ( 'loud 
Hands Ritual Series 1982, Ritual Series 7/82 1 Ritual Series 1982 (cat nos 1-2,43,45) Singei con-

extended the original concepts without losing sight ol nature now da- magi&lt; em. males from the

Singer's newest structures resonate with a spiritual aura usually associated with religious art. 
This aspect of his work calls to mind oriental precedents — as well as Barnett Newman's Stations of 
the Cross, 1966, abstract paintings that express deep spiritual meaning and mythic content. Indeed, 
both sources have had a profound impact on his imagination. In much of the work executed since 
19M0, there is a feeling of self-containment. These are low structures whose "walls" act, not as 
barriers as they do in Western architecture, but as gates that lead into the interior, evoking fences 
and gates of Shinto shrines. The walls and the platforms that connect them introduce us into a 
sequence of measured spaces. These magical enclosures evoke ritualistic associations and encompass 
a universe that is part nature, part myth. As Joseph Campbell has said, rituals are organizations of 
mythological symbols, and by participating in the drama of the rites one is brought directly in touch 
with these symbols. "The function of ritual ... is to give form to human life." ' Through his arresting, 
evocative sculpture and drawings Michael Singer gives significance and form to both life and art.
