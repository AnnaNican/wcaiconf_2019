3 50 \ 2" 50 in. 3.50 \ 14.60 m and 3 50 \ 6.10 m — this, in a nutshell, 
is the formal description ofjames Rosenquist's new work, rhese are the 
uniisu.il dimensions of The Swimmei in the Econo-mist, a three-part 
painting made specially b\ the American artist for Pouts, he 
Guggenheim Berlin.The first showing of a work commissioned for the 
gallery, its presentation follows the historically focused inaugural 
exhibition. Visions of Paris. Robert Delaunay's Series, and more exhibitions 
are to tome 

mmissioned works form an important part of our program. 
i )ur intention is to contribute to Berlin's cultural life with relatively 
compact but out oi-the-ordm..r\ exhibitions tailored to our space. The 
response has been overwhelming. More than 45,000 visitors saw 
Delaunay's Paris paintings. I ongei opening hours and tree admission on 
Mondays were positively received, as were the guided tours and 
lunchtime lectures. Our special events, including a "Soiree Delauna) 
and a film series entitled "Visions of Paris," were sold out. 

Rosenquist is one of American Pop art's most important 
representatives. He achieved international acclaim with his first large- 
s&lt; ale canvas, /-///. completed in 1965.The biggest Pop art painting in 
the world at that time, with a width of more than twenty-six meters, it 
w.is shown after its debut at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York at 
several ol Europe's most important museums m a traveling exhibition 

In subsequent years. Rosenquist has produced further "big 
paintings" Prior to The Swimmei in the Econo-mist, he painted The Holy 
Roman Empire through Check l&gt;&gt;&lt;nit Charlie (1994), which alludes to 
Berlin 

Rosenquist gained wide recognition in Germany in the 1960s. 
The collector Peter Ludwig met him in 1968 and soon afterwards 
purchased Horse Blinders (1968-69), tod. in one of the artistic highlights 
of the Ludwig Museum in Cologne The work, which is more than 
twenty-five meters wide, is one of Rosenquist's "environmental 
paintings." the term for a series of paintings that, like I - I I I. cover the 



walls of an exhibition space to create a "room" themselves. The Swimmei 
in the Econo-mist, created for Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin's gallery, is 
such a wraparound work, but transcends earlier ones in terms of size 
To show historically important material from a contemporary 
perspective .\n^\ support the creation of new work — this mission defines 
our cultural activities in Berlin, now and in the future. 

Dr. Rolf-E. Breuei 

Spokesman of the Board of Managing Directors, Deutsche Bank AG 



Preface 



One of the primary missions of the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin is to 
commission major works by the most prominent and promising artists 
of our time. The elegant simplicity of the Richard Gluckman-designed 
gallery is intended to provide an uniting setting in which artists can 
realize their own visions. With the spectacular suite of three paintings 
entitled The Swimmet in the Econo-mist (1997-98), made expressly for our 
new exhibition spate in Berlin, James Rosenquist has given this program 
a remarkable launching. 

Rosenqmst and 1 began discussions regarding the commission in 
November 1996, the month of the most recent presidential election in 
the United Stales: the paintings were completed in 1998, the year of a 
general election in Germany. The timing proved to be auspicious. As the 
artist has repeatedly said, tor him. election years are tilled with the 
possibility ot change, kosenquist's first two monumental room-scale 
works, /-/// (1964-65) and Horse Blinders (1968-69), were also begun 
in election \ ears, during a particularly charged period in American 
history. It was a time of prosperity, but also of the Vietnam War, race 
riots, and political assassinations 

Like those murals from three decades ago. The Swimmer in the 
Econo-mist is a history painting for our time and is realized on the 
grandest scale. Indeed, it .s a painting about change— in the world and 
for the artist himself It is. in Rosenquist's words, about "the tumult of 
our economy," the upS and downs experienced around the world and. m 
particular, m the United States today and in Germany in the years after 
reunification. The swirling vortices that barrel across the vast expanse of 
these paintings and give the work its exceptional dynamism mark an 
entirely new direction m the artist's visual vocabulary 

Rosenqu.sts own history at the Guggenheim stems ba.k to his 
inclusion in Lawrence Allow avs Six Painters and the Object in 1963, i 
milestone exhibition for the emergence of Pop art in the United States 
We have ,ont. nued to express our commitment to Rosenquist's work, 
not only through our involvement with this commission, but with the 



recent acquisition of his Flamingo Capsule This important mural from 

1970, with motifs that reappear in The Sim, una in '/" Econo-mist, is 
among the works that form the foundation of the collection of the 
Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 

Roseiuiuist is well known in ( German} Sin&lt; t the mid- 1960s, his 
paintings have been included m innumerable gallery and museum 
exhibitions throughout the country, and he was the subje&lt; I ol a mid 
career retrospective at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in &lt; ologne in 
1972. '/'//&lt;• Strtiiimci in the Econo-mist, however, is his first majoi 
commission tor the ( it) oi Berlin. 

A commitment to enriching the arts in Berlin is central to oui 
partnership with Deutsche Bank M\ thanks ^^ especially to Dr. Rolf- 
E. Breuer, Spokesman of the Board of Managing Directors, who with 

tremendous interest and goodwill has carried on the program of enlight- 
ened support of the visual arts originally conceived by Ins predecessor. 
Hilmar Kopper, Chairman ol the Supervisory Board I am also deeply 
grateful to Dr Ariane Grigoteit and Friedhelm Hutte.who with intel- 
ligence md professionalism have successfully coordinated with the 
Guggenheim stafFto realize this exhibition 

Throughout the planning stage of the commission, the expertise 

ot Lisa Dennison, Chief Curator and Deputy Director and of Robert 
Rosenblum, Curator of Twentieth-Century Art, proved invaluable 1 am 

also grateful to Professor Rosenblum tor having organized this exhibition. 
and to fulia Blaut, Assistant Curator, who worked with him so ably 

My deepest thanks, however, go tojan.es Rosenquist himself Mis 
intense work over the past year has ensured the success ofthis presen- 
tation and its accompanying i atalogue.

Interview 



ES ROSENQUIST BY ROBERT ROSENBLUM 



IBLUM: Jim, going back through 
the decades, from the 1960s to the present, 
I realize that you've had any number of big 
public commissions in your career. 

JAMES ROSENQUIST: Not many, about twelve 

Well, that sounds like a lot to me. Anyway, 
for starters, I'd like to know how you feel about 
this one in terms of your earlier murals. How 
does it fit in? 

JR: In 1964, I decided to do a painting during an 
election year 

RR: That's when you started F-lll? 

JR: Yes. I had quite a bit of life and painting experi- 
ence up until then, doing industrial painting and 
painting large signs in Brooklyn andTimes Square 
I thought I'd start out nonobjective but optimistic 
As the election year began, I wished for the best. 
1 wondered which wa\ the painting would go 
I thought about inv existence as ,1 person living in 
the United States, where I came from, where I grew 
up — the whole thing — and 1 wondered what 1 
could do. What did life mean to me! 

So that's when I really began wondering, Was m\ 
life a joke? All I knew was what I read in the papers, 
and things happen in an election year People hope 
tor change, but artists .ire more optimistic IheViet- 
11,1111 War had started. Earlier. I had met Paul Berg, 
who did a piece on Roy I lchtenstein and myself for 

the St Louis Post-Dispatch, and in '''4 he had just 
come back from seven combat missions And Paul 
brought that information directl) to the people in 



St I ouis 1 hex got the news trom the horse's 
mouth. 

At that time, my parents lived in Dallas, Ie\as, 
and John Kenned\ had (list been assassinated I had 

been in Dallas a month before his assassination 

People were bored I here was ,1 terrible heat wave 
People were dying Old 1. idles were out shooting 

their pistols .it target practice. There was .1 Dallas 
c owboys football game and fans were throwing 
whiskey bottles, breaking them in the hot streets of 
Dallas There seemed to be a feeling of outrage 
fohn Kenned) tame into that situation, and for a 
long time I thought he was killed b\ the weather — 
the weather killed him because everyone was so 
aggravated at that time. [Laughs.] 

Later. I returned to Dallas and visited an amuse- 
ment park billed Six Flags Over rexas. I saw a B-36 
bomber sitting there, resting quietly, obsolete. 

The bomber was just a decoration? 

JR: Yeah And I savs imitation nature being put forth 
to children for amusement rhere were ceiling fans 
mounted in trees outside to give people a breeze. 
There was .1 poor live parrot 111 a cage m a simulat- 
ed cowboy-western 1890s town rhere w.is .1 loud- 
speaker m the cage, saying, "Hi, I'm Polly the parrot 
Who are you. little girl?" And I remember this poor 
parrot being tortured by this loudspeaker I hey also 
had a riverboat in a fake ditch the) had dug, with 

some big gear propelling the boat around, and I 
dreamed that this was some unseen pilot propelling 
our economy. At that time. General Motors was the 
highest-paid contractor for the Vietnam War I here 

were |iist a lot of cra/\. ridiculous things going oil. I 
felt that all the obsolete airplanes— all the boinbcts 



built for defense but never used -were responsible 
tor allowing people to live a certain lifestyle, to have 
three and a halt . hildren and two and .1 hall i ars and 

.1 house in tin- suburbs 

Anyway, there were m.in\ reason-, for doing the 
/-/// painting I p. tinted it in iu\ Studio it 42'' 

Broome Street 1 had man) visitors there from 

Christo t&lt;&gt; I co |t astelli], lleana [Sonnabend], Bob 

K.iusJienberg, Steve Pax ton. Alan Solomon 

[Michelangelo] Pistoletto, Virginia I )wan, I &gt;ii k 

Smith, i lot ot others Richard [eigen brought 

down movie people. Anyhow, the whole painting 
was taken eventually as a gre.it anti-wai paii 
\nd th.it w.is largely the criticism ot th.it picture 

RR Wasn't this the first picture of yours that 
produced the virtual reality of a completely 
artificial, wraparound environment, like what 
surrounds us now in the mural you're doing 
for Berlin? 1 mean, a completely synthetic 
world, where you can't find a beginning, a 
middle, or an end — a continuous, 360-degree 
experience? 

JR: It w.is like a wr.ip.iround fol the esc I used fluo- 
rescent, I &gt;a\ -( llo i olors I used jukebox paint on pan 
of it. The idea w.is to look .it something in the paint- 
ing and s.i\." that .uliit is that color because ot this 
color coming m here 

What I didn't control is the door or the ceiling. 
Later on. m 1970 I did a wraparound coloi paii I 
with dr\ icc fog to eliminate the flooi [Horizon 
Honn Sweet Home] Hone Blinders [1968 69] was also 

a wraparound painting ( arlo IKtkert. win. worked 

with Pontus Hulten ai the Moderna Museet in 
Stockholm, said to me, "We always hang., hard 



painting on the right when you walk in the room 
And we ilv, Lys hang i sofi painting on the left 
because, as you know, the left is always softer." I 
thought, that*s funny What's softer; W hat area is 
softer than the other? So I thought, instead of going 
left or right, win not go straight ahead? And the 
result was Horse Blind n 

So how many wraparound paintings are 
there altogether? 

JR: Three 

RR: F-lll, Horse Blinders . . . 

JR: And Horizon Home Swet I Honn 

RR: Oh, yes. 

JR: With the I 

So that had dry-ice fog coming up from 
the floor. 

JR: 1 also thought of doing .1 hydrogen fog on the 
ceiling, but I don't like technology that much ["hat's 
wh) I like painting, because it's an illusion. Sculpture 
is fast inating diffii ult, exti lordinary But 1 haven't 
done much of it -except Fumbleweed [1963-66] a 
chrome-plated barbed-wire sculpture — because 1 
like the idea of illusionism, and hov* difficult it is to 
s.i\ something on .1 surface that's only a sixteenth 

11 inch thick. You turn it sideways and it looks 
like nothing, but you turn it full face and it looks 
like something 



RR: It goes with your interest in virtual reality. 
It's all an illusion that looks real. 

JR: Well, I don't have much of an interest in virtual 
re ility. 

Something might look like real metal, real 
shine, real plastic, but it's just paint. 

JR: It's just paint. I saw .1 Miro shov, at Pierre 
Matisse [Gallery] in the 1950s, and 1 walked into the 
room and 1 was just taken aback by these paintings 

1 e I didn't know how (hex were done All 
there was wis .1 vision He took a rag and smeared 

the ■ "lo, on with a piece of silk, in very large, soft 

disks that looked like they'd been airbrushed. and 
then he connected those disks with hues, little 
touches of color, very very beautifully done not 
meeha1ne.1l. With Chinese bristle brushes. No air- 
brushes There was this amazing look ot" those Miro 
paintings from across the room, and then 1 dis^n 
ered that it was only paint You know, that's what I 

like. 

I wanted to ask you how you conceived 
this mural. For one thing, I'm sitting here 
looking at quotations from [Picasso's] 
Guernica in it, wondering whether you've ever 
used quotations from other works of art in 
your paintings before. I'm also looking at 
quotations from your own earlier works of art, 
like your recycling of passages from F-lll 
and Industrial Cottage [1977]. So I'm curious 
about the mood of this picture. Here we are in 
the late 1990s, and throughout this mural 
there is a backwards glance into the earlier 



history of twentieth-century art and twentieth- 
century wars and your own work. 1 would love 
to hear anything you have to say about this. 

JR: Well, at one point 1 thought that this painting 
was going to Bilbao 1 heard that they had wanted to 

get Guernica tor Bilbao I'd seen Guernica many times 
at the Museum of Modern Art [in New York| before 
it was returned to Spam. And so I thought I'd. start 
off with elements from the past and an abstraction 
of ( Guernica going mi" a reflection that goes into a 
meteor with .\\) insignia on it. The idea or the mete- 
or with the insignia is that during the C old War and 
throughout my own history — the history ol all of us 
for a number of decades— we kept taking the danger 
of nuclear holocaust out from under the pillow. 
examining it, and then putting it away And then one 
day a few years a^k the Russians just pointed all 
their missiles in another direction And no one m 
America celebrated I would have thought that peo- 
ple would have been like they were at the end ot 
W.uld War II. w lieu my uncles went out and shot 
off their shotguns 

RR : Global joy. 

JR: rhat global joy — never heard about it It never 
happened So then by chance, according to the 

media — we Started having tons of natural disasters 1 

mean, we had earthquakes, fires, floods, every kind 

a( thin- you i an imagine 
Divine punishment. 

JR: I don't know what it was And then I thought 

about the idea oi Star Wars n\d sneaking all these 



war weapons up into space, which we're doing now. 
and how no one knows ..bout it No one knows the 
real fa&lt; ts about what our government is doing. And 
then we're racing toward the millennium In other 
words, the twentieth century has been a horrible 
century My father, born in 1908, sav, the rise ol the 
automobile, the airplane He sav, .ill these things 
We've had these horrible wars— World War I. World 
War II A bunch ol my relatives were in there One 
got killed rhere's been .ill this In. ruble stuff. So the 
century's been very dynamic, but the dynamic has 
been ver\ harsh and painful And so you think, Wow, 
my gosh, I hope we get that over with What we've 
gotten over with in that at one point two major

this painting, like /-///. is a diary of the terrible

[twenty -seven-and-a-half-meter] painting looks 
more optimistic, but the forty-eight-foot [fourteen- 
and-a-half-meter] painting chat was shown in Bilbao 
looks tumultuous 

RR: I'm curious about this "Apocalypse Now" 
mood. One of the things that's so striking 
about this mural is the image of the vortex. 
I'm trying to remember, and you'll have to 
help me, when you've used it before. 

JR: I never have 

RR: That's what I thought. It looks totally new 



to me, and it's a whole new kind of velocity. 
I remember earlier works like Star Thief 
[1980], and how they had kind of a superson- 
ic streak across them. But that's energy that's 
going somewhere, and these are like black 
holes or drains. I'm interested in this image, 
this whirlpool movement of galactic speed. 
But you tell me about it. 

JR: Well, it's a totally optical space Its a nev\ device 
for me. really Its like an exclamation that shows 
change Now. this image right here [points], there's 
going to be some fluorescent spots on it dots 
that stuk out in front It will look like it's m VI ) 
when I get through V\ ith it. 

I hate to show paintings when they're no. tin

'•snap'' is going to be But you're seeing things now 
,.. the) unfold When tins all goes together, you'll 

w ilk in the trout dooi of the museum .ml tins 
ninety-foot painting should propel itself down to 
one end of the room ind to the other, ami then 

..round the room. 

I Ik priority for me is visual invention and, real 
ly, content is secondary but then the content is what 
grounds the picture. It pulls itself in place and in 
time, you know -whatever it is, even if it's banal 

RR: It's true. So far, what hits me so forcefully 
about this new work is the difference from 
your earlier work— namely, it's got all these 
dynamos. You feel as though you're going to 
be flung into some kind of spinning engine or 
to the end of the world. There are all these 
black holes. And it has a furious kind of pro- 
pulsion that is very unlike the movement in 



what you've done before. But that is what's so 
startlingly fresh about it. 

Then I'm also wondering about the images, 
some of which are new and some of which are 
old. You started working on this piece expect- 
ing it to go to Bilbao, but in the end it's being 
done for Berlin. So how much does the 
German context figure in your choice of 
images here? 

JR: Well, the window image represents the (.M.u in

There's ilso a woman there whose face is slivered 
into .1 i oiled spring. 

That spring is great because it's just like 
a five-and-dime-store version of all of those 
whirling drains, the same spiraling image. 

JR: Its like a dynamo springing out 

This should be your crowning achievement 
of the twentieth century. It's now three decades- 
plus after your beginning. Being an art histori- 
an, I'm looking sideways to works of other 
artists of your generation, and wondering how 
they might plug into this. You, in particular, 
I know, have always been very generous about 
looking at, responding positively to, the work 
of your peers and your juniors and seniors. 
But one of the things I've noticed in a lot of 
work of your generation — I'm thinking about 
artists like Johns and Rauschenberg and 
Lichtenstein — is that in their work of the last 
decade or so, they more and more frequently 
used quotations from their own earlier work, 
whether as fragments or as a whole. And this 
is something that I'm aware of in this work, 
too. I mean, it's a mood of summary, of 
anthology, of Proustian recall. Do you think 
of it as a kind of summa of everything you've 
done, and do you want to look back, quote, 
see your work through the layers of time? 

JR: It's not really a summation. It's more like usmg 

the past .is a springboard to new imagery, or .1 new 
kind ot imagery. Something that people tan recog- 

nize from the past. 



What's so exciting is that this looks like 
a springboard for a whole new language. I 
mean, what would strike any viewer first is the 
momen-tum here. It has this insane, young 
energy. It's like an earthquake, a volcano, you 
name it. It has more speed, more force than 
anything I've ever seen of yours before. You 
know, it's like being inside a laundromat. 

JR: Exactl) That's what I want. [Laughs.] You hit it! 

Well, we might say a cosmic laundromat. 
I mean, you're in a spin-dry cycle from begin- 
ning to end. 

JR: I hat's right. And that is because of. I think, the 
tumult of our economy over the last tew years Up 
A\)d down, up and down, up and down, and the 
whole world is going into a tumult because ot the 

nuclear roles coming down COO. 1 here's a lot of 
optimism, but there's pessimism, too It's been very, 
\er\ vigorous. 

RR: I wanted to ask you about the title of this 
suite of pictures: The Swimmer in the Econo- 
mist. I mean, I know you love puns in your 
images, like the hairdryer equalling an air- 
plane's nose cone, or fingernails equalling pen 
points. But tell me about u the Econo-mist," 
which is a verbal pun. Tell me about the title. 

JR: Well, the swimmer . . . apparently, there's an old 
Venetian saying, "The artist swims in the water, the 
critic stands ashore." So the swimmer is the active 
party And the economy is a dream. It describes 
being immersed in a tumult 



Hopefully, this is going in the right direction It's 
always been hard to (ell You know I thought 1 was 
an old socialist for a long time, because I thought 
about the inequalities between people, and what you 
tan d^ about all ofthat I don't consider myself a 

humanitarian, but I think about waste and unhappy 
billionaires [laughs] and people who are happy, and 

about the da\s in the sixties when kids m the com- 
munes could bu\ a truckload ofgranola at the teed 
store for the rest of their lives for a hundred biitks. 
and wear arm\ -surplus clothes and raise tons of kids 

and have a life living on nothing. You have children. 
I have children We all hope that the race continues 

Another thing I was going to call this painting 
was The Ract 

RR: Race? 

JR: The Race 

RR: As in the human race? Or as in the run- 
ning race? 

JR: Everything All of it 1 ike Thelonious Monk 

said. "All ways, always " 

RR: Well, I can see the energy of it. I mean, 
just the sheer miles-per-hour moving from one 
end to the other is right up there with cosmic 
races. 

JR: It's race, it's speed It's racial, its promoting the 
rate regardless of what the rate is, staying alive. I hat's 
win The Race was a title A lot of times I haw ten 

titles, and then it boils down to one. or none 



10 



RR: You know, something else I noticed about 
this new work has to do with the way you've 
always switched back and forth between, on 
the one hand, grisaille painting that looks like 
black-and-white photographs, and, on the 
other hand, color that looks synthetic, a la 
plastics and TV. But that kind of back-and- 
forth between color and noncolor seems to be 
much more intense, much more polarized here 
than I've ever seen it, and that also contrib- 
utes to the "race," the rush of it, moving from 
memories of Guernica and its recall of black- 
and-white newspaper photos, into the newer 
media of these crazy, incandescent, California 
candy colors. I have never seen such an excit- 
ing contrast in your work. It really has a 
momentum here it has never had before. 

JR: Well, studying color is like playing the piano. 
One needs practice I "hat color right there on the 
painting [points] is onl) about three colors mixed 
up in the right quantity. 

But this color, even for you, is a new kind 
of artificial. It's got every color in a plastic 
rainbow, and just in terms of clash, it has the 
kind of energy that all those spinning drains 
have. You were talking about painting as illu- 
sion, and I'm fascinated by the part of this 
mural where an airplane disappears and re- 
emerges as if . . . well, in the way I see it, 
as if the canvas were being unfurled or furled 
before your eyes. So that the painting is 
almost being wrapped up while you see it. And 
that gives it a whole kind of snap, crackle, 
and pop it wouldn't have otherwise. It makes 



your earlier pictures look absolutely flat. This 
has an unstable, sweeping energy that rushes 
through the whole panoramic spread. 

JR: Well, you know, there are suhhnun.il memories 
foi i lot of things Tins is an aside, but Richard 
Feigen has tins beautiful Turner painting in lus din- 
ing room It's called Tin Reconstruction of tlu Temple 
Wa\ in the background, there's .1 temple, and then 
there's this incline at the bottom of the painting, and 
these people are dancing and playing the flute ind 
frolicking, but they're going downhill 1 ike life is 
fun and everything, but you're still going down. 

It's like this slope in your painting, like 
something that's sneaking along on the 
ground. It's got the quality of an undertow. 

And now, a totally different question. I 
remember the last time 1 saw this here, it was 
in a different state and I was, as usual, trying 
to think of how it relates to other works of art 
from the 90s or the 80s. And one of the things 
that occurred to me is that the only other 
place I've seen this kind of wild, almost incom- 
prehensible cosmic space is in some of the 
recent paintings of Frank Stella. They look 
like computer explosions, but they are in fact 
totally controlled and corseted like yours. Do 
you have any connections with that? 

JR: The cosmic explosion . . . 

rr : Well, it's a kind of spatial abstraction 
that's very new in the late twentieth century. 
It looks like cyberspace, and it's something 
that implies infinite extension and total incom- 



prehensibility. It just doesn't fit into any pre- 
dictable spatial patterns, and it feels as if 
you're being sucked into a galaxy. Stella is 
the only thing that I've seen in terms of 
abstract painting that I can connect visually 
with what you're doing. I don't know if this is 
just an accident . . . 

JR: I hke Frank's work a lot, and I've watched him 
since he started At first, it was hke h&lt; vi is putting 
building blocks togethei and then ii got mon and 
,,„,, more and more sophistii ited until 

all of a sudden, you Can'l tell where it starts and 
where it ends It's brilliant. 1 mean, I think Ins plas 

ticitj is incredible It's great Bui foi me, painting 
means making some reference to one's time 

RR: You've been around for some decades and 
we're approaching the millennium and, not to 
sound too poetic about it, this mural is like a 
time capsule of twentieth-century history. It's 
got the epic momentum of the past, and it also 
has some sense of bursting through a sound 
barrier into the future. But, above all, it's got 
the panoramic sweep that sums up our planet, 
the cosmos, and whatever you can buy in the 
five-and-dime store. It goes from heaven to 
hell and from the particular to the universal. 
Something like from here to eternity. 

JR: \Vr\ kind But I'mjUSt m the middle ol it, and 

this end walls going to be a sur]

NOTHER COUNTRY 



JUDITH GOLDMAN 



I. From nmc to five, tor the last year, James Rosenquist has been working on .1 suite oi thi 
mural paintings, The Swimmei m the Econo-mist, commissioned tor Deutsche Guggenheim 
Berlin. He's been on a tight schedule, painting against a deadline that is drawing near In a 
month, the pictures must be installed, and they are almost finished. Only a fevi areas uni. mi to 
be painted. Roscnquist has just returned from the local art store, where he's been looking for 
the colors that he needs tor his final touches, or what he likes to call "hot Inks." He plans to 
add color accents — an acrid yellow, a glaring orange. These Day-Glo tones comprise a palette of 
jangling, vulgar tints. They are the colors of roadside signs th.it advertise take out barbecues and 
X-rated entertainment. They are crass colors that defy ^,ood taste and give The Swimmei in the 
Econo-mist its essential edge and disequilibrium. 

Standing 111 front of one of the paintings. Rosenquist studies it. Although lie works 
from maquettes and preparatory drawings, he spends large stretches of tune looking it paintings 
in progress. Usually he sits and stares. Sometimes he paces back and forth along the length &gt;&gt;! 
the large studio. Often he studies his paintings at the end ot the day, when the natural light 
grows dim, because color values subside and mistakes are easy to read. He is not aV( rsi to 
change. If he thmks it is necessary, he will disregard plans and compositions and start over. In 
the course of completing The Swimmer in the Econo-mist, lie has made various alterations. At one- 
point, he decided the paintings were about the future, not the past, and removed images that he 
regarded as too reminiscent of earlier work: a man's head, swirling hair, a field ot spaghetti. 

Rosenquist has just finished painting the large orange oval that divides the twenty- 
seven-and-a-half-meter panel, and while he waits for the paint t&lt;&gt; dry, I ask him about that 
shape, which recalls a similar one in the l°7&lt;) painting Flamingo Capsule (fig. 4) His answer is 
fast and short: '"It's a reflection from a blast furnace." he savs. then, changing the subjei t, 
explains the procedures used to create the image. He describes how he had t&lt;&gt; mask out the 
entire area around it before he began to paint and why he used a Spra) gun (be. ause the 
method rendered a smooth mu\ even surface) Rosenquist jealousl) guards the meaning of his 
paintings, but willingly explains their elaborate procedures 

Countless small decisions are crucial to Rosenquist's art At first glance, his paintings 
seem to be an arbitrary melange of dissonant contrasts and yokingS. But they are not arbitrary 
at all. Every aspect is carefully considered. Fairings are strange and hard to comprehend, but the 
couplings are never accidental or casual. Visual narratives meander and ramble aimlessly, but

FXosenquist means what he says, and he is almost always savin- something. When he contrasts , 

I, ,IK , reared surface with a swirl of hand-applied paint, or juxtaposes monochromatic 

grays with bright and dissonant hues, or tills a window with the colors of the German flag, or 
restates Picasso's Guernica (fig 8), he is not acting arbitrarily. These are the elements and images 
from which he constructs his art. 

The Swimmei in the Econo-mist utilizes all the devices and visual conventions we have 
come to expect from Rosenqmst: the disruptions and disconnections; the barrage of imagery; 
the unlikely mergings; the contradictions; the blatant non sequiturs; the strident colors; and, of 
course, the scale. The Swimmer in the Econo-mist is the largest suite of paintings he has produced 
to date. Consisting of three separate pictures, m twenty-one sections, it measures three-and-a- 
half meters high and more than forty-eight meters long. Designed to cover three walls inside 
Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin's gallery, the paintings are mammoth and their towering images 
envelop their viewers. 

Rosenc|iiist is ., master of big pictures. He is well-versed in scale and a connoisseur of size. He 
is also accustomed to working on assignment. When he was voting, he painted black-and- 
orange emblems for Phillips 66 gasoline on signs and bams across the flatlands of his native 
Midwest. He was a natural. He could draw anything to specification. He could scale up or scale 
down, In 1954, he worked for General Outdoor Advertising, painting billboards around 
Minneapolis. He painted immense parrots, enormous whiskey bottles, and letters that rose 
three meters high. In 1955, he moved to New York, having received a scholarship to the 
Art Students I eague. After a year, when his money ran out. he found a job painting signs. He 
joined I OCal 230 of the Sign. Pictorial, and Display Union. He was the union's youngest mem- 
ber, but he became their star artist as his skill increased and his repertoire expanded A newspa- 
per reporter referred to him as a "billboard Michelangelo " 

He spent two years at dizzying heights, balancing atop bridges and standing on scat- 
folds above Times Square, painting movie stars' smiles, mammoth lips, toothpaste grins, a gigan- 
tic dimple m Kirk Douglas's chin. He learned a lot on the boards. Painting fragments taught 
him about collage. Working on a large scale afforded him lessons m abstraction, close-up vis, on. 
and the effects of size. He learned about mixing paint, too: how to make it silkv and so thick 
and smooth that it flowed like cream. He absorbed a syntax of commercial techmques.au 



alphabet of advertising colors, like suntan brown and lipstick red. The trade secrets he learned 
influenced him and eventually transformed his art. He stopped making the small, gray ab$tra&lt; I 
pictures that he painted in the evening after work. Instead, he found his subject matter in the 
detritus of consumer culture and the remnants of everyday images He treated a new. idiosyn 
cratic visual language. 

Gaudy, strident, blunt, ordinary, and strangely mute. Rosenquist's new language was 
steeped in the American vernacular. It consisted of fragments taken from printed advertise 
ments — pieces of angel food cake, bottle tops, spaghetti, razor blades, tire treads, and the grilles 
and windows of old cars. Although the images are naggmgK familiar, Rosenquist's pictures 
stubbornly resist interpretation. Their meanings are fugitive. Like poems built with dense in. i a 
phors, they are hard to parse. This was what Rosenqnist intended He wanted Ins art CO he cool 
and detached. Hoping to avoid the emotional angst that weighed down Abstract Expressionist 
painting, he chose objects garnered from a commercial netherland — dumb, malleable, anon) 
mous images that he once described in conversation as "old enough to pass without notii e. but 
not old enough to trigger nostalgia " 

Rosenquist has often said that he intended to make pictures, not statements. Sounding 
like a strict modernist, he has maintained that the space deputed In m image is more impOl 
tant than the image itself and that he is not interested in objects, but in then abstract proper- 
ties. He employed numerous devices to deflect meaning. Odd couplings defy logic non 
sequiturs, like a field of orange spaghetti, disrupt narratives; realistic images, rendered &lt; lose-up, 
become abstractions. Even his colors — the pigments of printed reproductions — have an artiti. ial 
aura, .\n anemic cast that creates distance. 

Despite Rosenquist's emphasis on formal properties and visual invention, his paintings 
never lack content. From the start, they addressed big themes, like love and war and sex and 
liberty. Hey 1 Let's Co foi a Ride (1961), whatever else it may concern, is about sedu&lt; tion, as is 
Waves (1962), albeit from another perspective. A Lot to Like (1962) and Silver Skies (1962; fig. 2) 
are reflections on superabundance— on an overcrowded visual field, on the plethora .»» products 
that inundate American consumers. And the paintings- punning titles are rife with hidden mean- 
ings and opinions. A Lot to Like suggests that there is, in fact, too much to like. No matter hovi 
mute the paintings seem, they are informed by conviction— even, at tunes, fanned by nnl, 
tion.They convey impressions and opinions about everything from advertising and assassii

resolutely resist words 

II. In the fall of 1964, an election year, Rosenquist began the large painting that became F- 1 1 1 
(1964-65; fig. 3), Ins first site-specific work. A transitional picture. F- / / / marked the end of 
Rosenquist's early, straightforward collage compositions and the beginning of his exploration of 
peripheral vision and big pictures. As with many of his major paintings, F-llfs conception and 
execution coincided with significant changes in his life. For the two preceding years, 
Rosenquist had been painting nonstop. His work had been featured in the Museum of Modem 
Art's . [mericam 1963 and in two major Pop art exhibitions: New Realists (at Sidney Jams gallery) 
and Six Painters and the Object (at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum). He'd also executed a 
commission for the 1964 World's Fair and completed enough pictures to fill solo shows in 
Pans, Los Angeles, and New York. He'd had to work hard to sustain his level of production, for, 
nnhke his Pop colleagues, Rosenquist did not employ reproductive techniques or pamt in 
series. Whereas Andy Warhol screenprinted his portraits of Marilyn Monroe, modifying their 
I olor and size, and Jim Dine varied his images of bathrobes and hearts by filling them with 
landscapes and a rainbow of colors, Rosenquist never repeated his compositions exactly or 
restated them by changing their color, size, or background. He was always starting over. Every 
painting was different. 

His style, however, remained consistent. He utilized the same visual inventions and kept 
refining his technique and extending his vision. He moved from simple couplings to allover 
i onfigurations. I le was continually finding new ways to combine and transmute provocative 
fragments into arresting, mysterious compositions. He was working all the time, and by the tall 
of 1^)4, he was tired and ready tor a change. He'd been experimenting with sculpture and 
environinent.il pieces and had started attaching objects to his canvases, He had reached a turn- 
ing point in his life .is well .is his art. He was about to lease a new studio, and he'd changed 
dealers: after the Green Gallery closed, he'd joined the Leo Castelli Gallery, where his first show 
w.is scheduled to open on April 17, 1965. 

Regarded .is Pop art's epicenter, the small Castelli gallery presented big shows, and 
Rosenquist wanted his first show there to have an impact. He intended to fill the entire gallery, 
to make the biggest panning he could, and he spent a year preparing for the exhibition. He

effect is cumulative. And finally, viewers discover that this fiercely antiwar picture is as much 
about vision .is it is about war. 

With F- / / /. Rosenquist had found a new canvas — the Castelli Gallery's front room— 
and for the next five years, he produced site-specific paintings like Area Code and Flamingo 
Capsule (both 1970) that exactly fit the gallery's walls. The most ambitious painting of the peri- 
od was Horse Blinders (1968-69; fig. 5), which, like F-1H, envelops viewers as it examines the 
nature of peripheral vision. Rosenquist began Horse Blinders during another election year. It was 
a particularly brutal year, during which Martin Luther King. Jr.. and Robert F. Kennedy were 
assassinated and Andv Warhol was shot. Its subject is the visual noise of consumer culture, and 
how we sec or don't see. As m /- / / /, a jumble of disparate images besieges viewers. The assault 
is intense, foi in each of the picture's corners, polished aluminum panels not only carry but 
relic, i images, heightening and multiplying the clamorous visual effects. The image of severed 
wires suggests that communication is impossible, and the title implies that horse blinders are 
needed to eliminate the incessant onslaught of random and raucous information. 

L980 was another election year. Ronald Reagan became president. The Iran hostage 
crisis was under way. The American economy was weak and an era of government deregulation 
and supply-side economics was about to begin. Rosenquist had started to think about painting 
another big picture He was looking for a new challenge, to do something he hadn't done 
before. He thought it would be interesting to step outside the gallery system, to create a picture 
that was too large to be exhibited m a commercial gallery or sold to a private collector, a 
painting that was neither site-Specific nor commissioned. 

For a good part of a year, Rosenquist worked on Stai Thief (1980; fig. 6). The largest 
painting he had made up to that time. Stai Thief features a strange amalgam of visual frag- 
ments— Strips of flying bacon, a starry skv; a skyscraper; a woman's head, split open to expose a 
gnarled mass of colored wires The imagery is dense and recondite. The smoothly painted sur- 
fa&lt; e seems to seal meaning m. But old themes slowly become apparent. Rosenquist's ongoing 
exploration of vision and space continues, space-age technology threatens nature and beauty. 
Unlike F- / / /, however, the vast space of Star Thief does not surround viewers, but confronts 
and engulfs them, stretching up and out. as far as the eye can see 

When he finished the picture, Rosenquist invited his longtime dealer Leo Castelli to 
see it. After looking at the painting, Castelli asked Rosenquist to accompany him to an address 



30 



on Greene Street, where he said he had something important to show him. When the) arrived 
Castelli opened the door to a ground-floor space, entered, and waved h.s arm ..round the larg. 
room, motioning toward a big wall.This was Castelli's new gallery, and to Rosenquist's amaze 
ment StarThief fit. The height of Greene Street's ceiling was approximately five-and-a-hall 
meters StarThiefis around thirty centimeters smaller. StarThief™ never mean! to be I site- 
specific picture, but the gargantuan paintings that followed it, like 4 New-Cle* Women (1982) 
were. For the next few years, the walls of the Greene Street gallery became EWiquist's nev. 
and largest canvas. 

Ill Given the years Rosenquist spent painting billboards and his abiding .uteres, in site sp« , ill 

paintings, it seems odd that he turns down most commissions. He accepts only those that 

est him, and in a career spanning more than four decades, they number approximate!, a d, 
b, 1976 he created murals for the Florida State Capitol at Tallahassee because he lues m

and ,„ l98 4, he panned Flowers, Fish, ani Fe les fo, the I v„ , (fig. 1) for the restaurant

There are pragmatic aspects to every commission-expectattons to be met, tons 

to be fulfilled. Commissions must communicate id. I emblems; they must please and

/ - / / / mural, but nothing was resolved at the meeting as the location of the commission had 
not /el been determined. In principle, the concept interested Roscnqinst. When Krens 
mini nied him .i few months later th.it the commission was set for the new Guggenheim in the 
former East Berlin. R^osenquist was pleased. 

As always, Rosenquist's experiences informed his new painting. He thought about 
German friends he had and German journeys he'd taken. He recalled a trip to East Berlin not 
long after the wall came down. He remembered seem- remnants of red stars on a wall, smelling 
disinfectant, and visiting places that looked devastated and bombed out, but he also recalled the 
emerging energy he'd seen and felt. He read up on German cities, on Berlin from the 1920s to 
the 1940s. He also re. id about Germany as a world power, about Prussian kings and German 
statesmen from Frederick II to Otto von Bismarck, and about the World Wars. 

He decided to create paintings that would reflect the new Germany and the Berlin of 
tod. iv. not the divided city of the past. He thought about F- 1 1 1 too. and how his quintessential- 
lv Pop picture had come to represent not just an art movement but the atmosphere ot its time 
It had been more than thirty years since he painted F- / / / and the picture still looked fresh. He 
wanted no less for The Swimmer in the Econo-mist. 

The Swimmei in the Econo-mist tells a tale about the future. It is a familiar story, one Rosenquist 
has told before, about politics and e&lt; onomics, war and commerce — only the setting is new. It 
takes place in Germany, after the fall of Communism. It is a post-Cold War story. As usual, the 
narrative is askew. There is no linear structure in The Swimmer in the Econo-mist, no sequential 
order to the heap of broken images Viewers are bombarded with a tumult of numbing things. 
The eye swims, stops and starts, going from close-up to long shot, from griss.ulle to technicolor, 
attempting to follow the action, to make sense where there is none to be made. The connec- 
tions are implausible: what is the relation in the largest painting between an airplane, a black 
swirl, an abstraction from Picasso's Guernica, and a whirlpool of fragmented cereal boxes covered 
with words listing the cereals' nutnents : 

In .i conversation about The Swimmer /// the Econo-mist, R.osenquist mentions the mark- 
up on .i box of cereal, stating that a four-dollar box of cereal only costs ten cents to produce Is 
he referring to the money spent on advertising? Are conclusions about his suite ot product- 
packed paintings meant to be drawn? In one of the panels, enlarged letters copied from pack- 



lges oflaundry bleach gyrate out of control. The Swimme, in the Econo-mist is a parable aboul 

the effects of war on economic growth, rhe reference to Guernim in the large panel a &gt; be 

ignored Not only is Guernica the twentieth century's best-known antiwa. mural, but Picasso 
meant the picture as a memorial to .. terrible bombing, to the destructive power of fascsm and 

the devastation of war 

The smallest panel provides the paintings" focus. It features a tableau ol retrospe. tive 
images that have been altered and updated. A window, reminiscent of one in Indmmd ( ottage 
(1 077- fig 9) but filled with the colors of the German flag, represents the snnr.se and the dawn 
,,„. f a new, unified Germany. Drill bus signify the industrial growth o( the countrys Ruhr

Acknowledgments 



Oceans and continents have been crossed in order to realize a major mural 
by James Rosenquist within the new exhibition spaces of the Deutsche 
Guggenheim Berlin. The idea of commissioning Rosenquist to create this 
monumental work— an important act of international patronage— was that 
of the Guggenheim's Director, Thomas Krens. After the project was 
launched, he, Lisa Dennison, Deputy Director and Chief Curator, and I made 
several trips from New York to the artist's home and studio in Aripeka, 
Florida, in order to survey the work in progress and to discuss with the 
artist the various and changing directions that the work might take en route 
to its final destination in Berlin. Meanwhile, one of the three paintings that 
comprise The Swimmer in the Econo-mist made its debut at the opening of 
the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in October 1997, offering a sneak preview 
of its final and complete display in Berlin in March 1998. 

I must extend my greatest thanks to James Rosenquist himself. 
Throughout this evolutionary period, he was admirably flexible, responding 
to questions and suggestions about which way to turn next. The immense 
problem of completing a wrap-around mural revived, in both sheer dimen- 
sions and lofty ambition, many of the frescoed walls of the Italian 
Renaissance. In effect, he has created, more than three decades later, an 
update of his epic masterpiece, F-lll (1964-65). 

Supporting this complex enterprise was a curatorial staff that was 
not only well informed about the artist's work, but that was wonderfully 
efficient and reliable. I refer to Julia Blaut, Assistant Curator, who coordi- 
nated all aspects of this exhibition and catalogue, and to Janice Yang, 
Project Research and Exhibition Assistant, who in addition to her many 
other responsibilities, compiled the exhibition history, bibliography, and 

text photographs. 

Many other individuals at the Guggenheim contributed their expertise 
to ensure the successful realization of this exhibition. I thank all of them 
for their indispensable assistance and dedication. I am extremely grateful 
to Karen Meyerhoff, Director of Exhibition and Collection Management and 
Design, who has been invaluable in planning the installation, and to Jocelyn 



Groom, Exhibition Design Coordinator, who has worked with her. Thanks 
are also due to Suzanne Quigley, Head Registrar, Collections and Exhibitions, 
who has expertly coordinated the shipping and insurance of the works, and 
to Paul Schwartzbaum, Chief Conservator, Guggenheim Museums, and Julie 
Barten, Assistant Conservator, who have supervised the preservation of the 
paintings and drawings. David Heald, Chief Photographer and Director of 
Photographic Services, provided counsel on photographic issues, ensuring 
that Rosenquist's murals be reproduced with the utmost accuracy, and 
Ellen Labenski, Assistant Photographer, photographed the drawings and 
working plans. The installation team, consisting of Steve Plaxco, Installation 
Specialist, Claus Maier, Jan Pippardt, Uwe Rommel, and Kai Volkmann, was 
outstanding. I am also thankful for the contributions made by Marilyn JS 
Goodman, Director of Education; Judith Cox, General Counsel and Deputy 
Director; Gail Scovell, Associate General Counsel; Julie Lowitz, Assistant 
General Counsel; Scott Gutterman, Director of Public Affairs; Julia 
Caldwell, Public Affairs Coordinator; Jocelyn Brayshaw, Chief Preparator; 
Liz Jaff, Assistant Preparator/ Paper; Laura Latman, Collection Registrar; 
Ultan Guilfoyle, Director of Film and Video Production; and Allison Lane, 
Producer. 

Thanks also go to curatorial interns Joanna Berman, Joanna Clark, 
Lai Orenduff, Sonya Sinha, and Daphne Walker, who enthusiastically pro- 
vided assistance on numerous aspects of this project. 

I would like to express my gratitude to Paul Pincus, Project Director, 
Development and Communications; Max Hollein, Executive Assistant to the 
Director; Ben Hartley, Director of Communications; and Kira von Eichel, 
Project Assistant, for their tireless efforts and deft coordination of prepara- 
tions between cities separated by land and sea. 

Our colleagues in Germany have been crucial in bringing this exhibi- 
tion to fruition. I wish to extend my thanks especially to Dr. Ariane 
Grigoteit, Friedhelm Hutte, and Britta Farber of Deutsche Bank, and to 
Svenja Simon, Gallery Manager, Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. This exhi- 
bition would not have been realized without their hard work and support.

The catalogue could not have been published without the adept super- 
vision of Anthony Calnek, Director of Publications, and the efficiency of the 
Publications Department. I am grateful to Elizabeth Levy, Managing Editor/ 
Manager of Foreign Editions, and Melissa Secondino, Production Assistant, 
for expertly overseeing the catalogue production. My appreciation also 
goes to Jennifer Knox White, Associate Editor, and Domenick Ammirati, 
Editorial Assistant, for their careful editing of the text. 

Special thanks must go to Margot Perman and Catherine Woodman 
of Real Design for designing this elegant publication. We are also grateful 
to contributing author Judith Goldman, preeminent Rosenquist scholar, who 
contributed an important essay. 

In organizing this exhibition and compiling the catalogue, many 
people generously supported our research efforts. I would like to acknowl- 
edge in particular Richard L. Feigen, Frances Beatty, and Lance R.D. 
Thompson of Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co. and Thaddaeus Ropac of Galerie 
Thaddaeus Ropac for sharing their expertise. I also thank Joanna Stasuk 
and Amy Poll at Leo Castelli Gallery for their assistance in compiling pho- 
tographic materials. 

The staff at the artist's studio provided valuable assistance every 
step of the way. Beverly Coe, Administrative Assistant, and Cindy Hemstreet, 
Administrative and Curatorial Assistant, were unflappable and always 
gracious and precise in responding to our myriad requests. Michael 
Harrigan, Curator and Archival Specialist, provided important materials 
for establishing an accurate account of the artist's career. Thanks must also 
go to Tony Caparello, Color Mixer, Painter, Studio Assistant; Kevin Hemstreet, 
Carpentry, Installer; Darren Merrill, Carpentry, Installer; Vadim Syrovoy, 
Studio Assistant; and John Spinks, Studio Manager.
