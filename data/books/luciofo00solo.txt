PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 



Lucio Fontana did not come to the attention of a broader American art public 
before the late i95o's when his daring canvas cuts marked him as a powerful 
innovator and a key figure on the European postwar scene. As often happens 
when a radical contribution is confronted and absorbed, curiosity about its origins 
and its place within the wider premise of innovative thought follows in its wake. 
To satisfy this interest and to isolate Fontana's development as draughtsman, 
sculptor, painter and proto-conceptual artist, the Guggenheim has undertaken 
this first museum retrospective in New York. 

Models for such an exhibition existed in Europe, since Fontana's work had 
been honored by numerous retrospectives there since his death in 1968. The most 
recent of these was staged by Erika Billeter a year and a half ago at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich, where she is Associate Director and Curator of Modern Art. Dr. Billeter 
was therefore invited to be curator of the current presentation, and we owe our 
thanks to her for the selection of works as well as the conception of the exhibition's 
accompanying catalogue. In these tasks she was aided by others close to Fontana's 
work, and their successful accomplishment could only have been achieved with 
the extensive help — both documentary and logistical — provided by the Archivio 
Lucio Fontana in Milan. The Archivio's President, Signora Teresita Fontana. the 
artist's widow, and Valeria Ernesti, its Secretary, were personally involved in the 
conception and realization of this Fontana retrospective .\nd gave us their gener- 
ous, valuable and unstinting support. Signora Fontana also figured as principal 
lender to this exhibition. Many other European and American collectors, private 
as well as institutional, also parted with their precious possessions m order to fur- 
ther the understanding of Fontana's art. Their names are listed separately to under 
line our debt to each of them. 

Collectors of Fontana's work are understandably concentrated in Italy, and 
Milan has become a veritable headquarters for the artist's man) tneiuU and 
admirers. But the exhibition selection also reflects wide-ranging concern with 
Fontana's work in other European countries and in the United States. [*0 assure 
participation of American collectors, the Guggenheim through 1 '■m\.\ Konheim, its 



Curatorial Administrator, brought important works in this country to Dr. Billeter's 
attention. Miss Konheim also coordinated the complex arrangements involved in 
this undertaking and assisted with the exhibition's installation and the gathering 
of catalogue documentation. The publication itself was edited and its production 
overseen by Carol Fuerstein, the Museum's Editor. To all these and others who 
must remain unnamed, I extend the Guggenheim's deep appreciation. 

The Fontana retrospective assembled here will, we trust, summarize the trench- 
ant contribution of an outstanding postwar figure who has not so far received his 
due in this country. As Dr. Billeter's catalogue introduction indicates, Fontana's 
work may also stimulate reflection upon creative expression analogous to his own 
on both sides of the Atlantic.

LUCIO FONTANA 

Between Tradition and Avant-Garde 

Erika Billeter 



Lucio Fontana in 1948 challenges the history of painting. With one bold stroke he 
pierces the canvas and tears it to shreds. Through this action he declares before 
the entire world that the canvas is no longer a pictorial vehicle and asserts that 
easel painting, a constant in art heretofore, is called into question. Implied in this 
gesture is both the termination of a five-hundred year evolution in Western paint- 
ing and a new beginning, for destruction carries innovation in its wake. A new 
pictorial beauty grows with Fontana out of the act of destruction. The punctured 
painting becomes a work of art in its own right, and the pierced canvas affords 
possibilities for a new formulation of easel painting. 

The Buchi (Holes) — those first examples of Fontana's new pictorial conception 
reveal themselves to us seven years after Fontana's death and nearly thirty years 
after their inception. They offer one among many gestural options. These canvases 
originated parallel to Pollock's early insight through which he perceived the canvas 
as a space within which to activate his gestural notations. Pollock dances into his 
paintings, brush in hand, but Fontana, too, performs a rhythmic dance as he per- 
forates the canvas with a knife to create structures that lead the viewer to re- 
experience his motions. The painter's gestures thus become the medium of his 
communicative power. A few years thereafter the artist further sharpens his gesture 
in his so called "Cuts" (Tagli) — those vehement canvas slits that instantly come 
to mind when we think of Fontana. The artist recalls how in his rage over a 
spoiled work he cut the canvas to pieces. The new pictorial concept thus was born 
of the act of destruction. Subsequently he would prepare his cuts like a Chinese 
ink painter who executes his brushstroke in a single motion following profound 
meditation. The cut is as unrepeatable as the brushstroke and cannot be corrected. 
"People think that to cut or pierce is easy, but so much of this stuff is discarded" 
he explained to a friend, adding that "the idea must become clear beyond a doubt." 
The cuts perpetuate the moment as East Asiatic ink painting does. Time freezes 
as we regard these works and as we seem to retain the cutting motion in our 
mind's eye. The perforation And the cutting of the canvas amounted to a revolu- 
tionary act when first performed. Today \vc see it in a context of gestural painting

which we have assigned a place in art history. For Fontana himself these actions 
were never aesthetically subversive but rather an art "contemplatively arrived at," 
as he himself spoke of it. It was an art that pursued a goal. When, in 1948, Fontana 
for the first time ceased to view the canvas as a painted surface, when he broke 
through it to wrest from it its third dimension, he began to call his paintings 
Concetti Spaziali or Spatial Conceptions. This term indicated what Fontana meant 
to express through his novel pictorial form and what, ultimately, he attempted to 
realize through his knifed works. All his paintings since 1948 relate to his search 
for the third dimension— for a concrete rendering of space through appropriate 
imagery. After the Manifiesto Blanco, published in Buenos Aires in 1946, all his 
manifestos accord a primary role to space as expression of an art with contem- 
porary implications. Fontana wanted to exceed the illusionistic space that had 
dominated painting since the Renaissance, that moved overwhelmingly into the 
foreground during the Baroque period and that preoccupied the Futurists as a 
dynamic process. 

No longer content to project space as illusion or trompe l'oeil, Fontana meant 
to introduce it into the picture as a fact. As he breaks into the canvas he no longer 
paints space but creates it. The painting in turn, instead of representing space, 
itself becomes space. Beyond this, the perforation and laceration of the picture 
surface and the resulting creation of a real space inseparable from its imagery, 
signified for Fontana, among other things, an art reflecting current scientific aware- 
ness, an homage to science. Fontana's interest in cosmic space developments was 
passionate. He did not live to see man's landing on the moon, which might well 
have convinced him that mankind could adapt in future to cosmic space— unless of 
course he would have come to share our present doubts on the subject. Be this 
as it may, it remains the objective of his Concetti Spaziali to transfer into art a 
fraction of this cosmic space as palpable reality. 

From the outset of this striving, space was a central theme for Fontana. He was 
born in 1899 in Argentina. His sculptor father, Luigi Fontana, was Italian, his 
mother Argentinian. Lucio himself began his career as a sculptor who before his 
Bucbi in 1949 had never painted a picture, although he had made pencil drawings 
at times. One of his most important early works the Uorno Nero, 1930, is a sculp- 
ture that still echoes Cubism. Through its hermetic fundamental conception as 
well as the compactness of its form, the work interacts ambiguously with space 
by declaring and preempting it at the same time. In the years that follow painted 
figurative pieces made of gesso and clay bear identical stylistic marks. In all of 
them, fleeting surface modelling dissolves Fontana's tectonic forms as their planes 
seem to recede into space. 

The traces of an artisanal handling appear to be carved into the soft material. 
Two elements which we shall encounter again in the artist's mature work are 
already discernible in these early examples: gesture and space integration.

Alongside these figurative sculptures Fontana creates abstract works. This gave 
rise to interesting constellations in the oeuvre of the young artist who obviously 
wished to keep his options open, preferring not to commit himself to one or the 
other direction. But the tensions inherent in the dialogue so characteristic of his 
late work are already evident in his abstract enclosures, the rod-like structures and 
the graffiti tablets of this early phase. The surface is agitated in his abstract pieces 
as well. Both in his figurative and in his abstract sculptures one is aware of a prox- 
imity to the Baroque. Fontana is capable of reinterpreting such elements because 
of his deeply rooted empathy with this particular cultural tradition. The Baroque 
dimension in Fontana's creation reflects a concern with space which will come to 
preoccupy him passionately throughout his life. Drawings related to these abstract 
three-dimensional works are conceived in outline form: they are economical in 
their expression and rendered in quick strokes. In a sense, they foreshadow the 
Concetti of the 1950's, much as the sculptures themselves seem to anticipate 
Fontana's late paintings. And among other work of these early years that also 
predicts a later period, the terra-cottas for Mazzotti's garden in Albisola Mare are 
like stones embedded in nature. From these there leads a direct path to his Nature, 
to emerge in 1959-60. 

In 1939, Fontana returned to Argentina after a lengthy stay in Italy. He first 
turned to sculpture but subsequently began automatic Surrealist-inspired drawing. 
It is at this stage that, for the first time, gesture unfolds as a decisive creative 
device, thus preparing Fontana for what he was to undertake a few years later: 
the image as living gesture. 1946 is the year of the Manifiesto Blanco, which was 
written by Argentinian artist friends upon Fontana's urging. The ideas in this 
document were based upon Fontana's elaboration of the concept of dynamism 
in art, originally developed by Boccioni in behalf of Futurism. Fontana first realized 
his ideas about dynamism in his Buchi, which thus may be taken as an optical 
translation of the manifesto. Today we interpret this text as an expression of 
gestural art and identify it as a verbal translation of European abstract expression- 
ism or informel painting, as it is usually called. At the time Fontana inspired 
the Manifiesto Blanco he still did not paint, but devoted himself exclusively to 
sculpture and to drawing. Only in retrospect do we partake of that agitation and 
sense the new beginning which now informs his work. His ceramic sculpture 
already displays forcibly torn surfaces which, however, are still decorated with 
figurative elements. To manifest fully his ideas about space and dynamism Fontana 
felt compelled to move into abstraction. 

The Concetti Spaziali in 1949 lead the artist to the realization of pure idea, freed 
from any attachment to the object. At the very moment he penetrates the canvas 
with his Buchi for the first time and as he integrates the space behind the painting 
in it, Fontana also creates his first environment. This Anihicntc SpOZtale, projected 
by means of ultraviolet light, first came into being at the (ialleria del Navigho in 



Milan. It amounted to nothing less than his first integration of a work of art with 
space, a realization he had been seeking for decades. In the years that follow, 
Fontana continues to shape environments, introducing an art form that others 
only adopted and eventually exhausted in the 1960's. 

A decisive change in Fontana's development had taken place with the Concetti 
Spaziali. Through them, the artist ceases to be a sculptor and becomes a painter. 
His dialogue with a plane, until now avoided, can no longer be delayed, but plane- 
ness is immediately ruptured in a search for three-dimensionality. What he pre- 
viously achieved on the surfaces of his sculptures by gestural means is now ex- 
pressed by the act of piercing the plane. Color no longer interests Fontana in these 
new experiments although earlier he had always colored his sculpture. What now 
concerns him deeply is gesture transformed into graphic structure. Initially he 
works upon white, that is, colorless planes. The ground is neutralized so that it 
remains no more than support for the gestural sign which thereby becomes charged 
in relation to the plane as a whole. It is impossible today to comprehend how 
radical this action was at the time. The perforation and laceration suggests that 
the canvas suffered, but implicit in the same act is a redeeming gesture toward an 
inherited, traditional pictorial form. 

During the entire subsequent period, Fontana remains tied to the Concetti 
Spaziali. In a very real sense the Concetti constitute his mature phase which he 
reached through a consistent development, on the one hand, and by a radical 
break with tradition, on the other. Fontana always pursued his artistic themes 
over a period of years, putting them aside for a while only to take them up again. 
The Buchi made us think of cosmic movements in their often circular dynamics. 
They were succeeded by paintings called Pietre (Stones) in which negative perfora- 
tion was opposed by positive accretion achieved by the setting of glass stones upon 
the pictorial surface. Figurative sculpture also returns once again in the 1950's, 
when Fontana participates in a competition for the execution of the portals for 
the Milan Cathedral. Here we encounter once more the sculptor of the 1930's and 
40's. Baroque elements continue to prevail in movement, spatial relationships and 
the fragmentation of tectonic corporeailty. It is hardly by chance that only a short 
time later, from 1954-57, Fontana creates a series of works clearly conceived in 
terms of their material and entitled Barocchi. Of these, four have titles that relate 
to literature although they remain entirely abstract. The titles, bestowed by 
Fontana himself, are Crocifissione, 11 Golgotha, L'Inferno and // Paradiso. They 
underline associations somewhat like those of the New York series and the ones 
related to the paintings inspired by Venice. Fontana never paints in a particular 
style at a particular time. While he lavishes color so freely in his Barocchi that 
they virtually become materializations, he is simultaneously capable of working 
tenderly in chalk and india ink. 



18 



1958 is the year of the first cuts, his Tagli. Fontana now slashes with a knife 
instead of puncturing holes in the canvas. Concetti Spaziali—Attese, Fontana's 
name for these works, may be translated as "expectations" or "hope." These 
monochromatic canvases with one or more incisions have become his trademark. 
Black gauze on the reverse of the canvas shimmers through the open cuts, acting 
as background while at the same time it evokes a darkly imaginary space. The title 
Attese refers to the mysterious world of darkness structured behind the incisions. 
For years, the cutting of the canvas was for Fontana an act of creative self-aware- 
ness. He was, nevertheless, preoccupied with other solutions even then. It is there- 
fore impossible to think in terms of periods as one considers Fontana's development. 
There are, to be sure, brief thematic phases— experimental, transitional states— 
that may hold his interest for a year or more. His Quanta of 1959 are just such a 
development— irregularly shaped canvases, with one or two slits, that may be freely 
combined with one another. The series called Fine di Dio (God is Dead) emerges 
in 1963-64. It is a sequence of egg-shaped pictures of identical format painted in 
sweetish monochromes. Surfaces are torn open by myriad holes suggesting galaxies 
of stars or perhaps moonscapes, a world in any case in which God does not exist. 
The Teatrini (Small Theaters), perforated monochromatic canvas backdrops with 
superimposed lacquered wooden cutouts which appear in 1964, like the Fine di 
Dio, are closer to colored objects than to paintings. The Teatrini look like small 
stages upon which silhouettes of trees and bushes lead their magic existence. We 
shall refrain from an attempt to define them. Fontana himself always held that art 
could not be explained. He saw it as a manifestation of human intelligence. 

While Fontana did not wish to explain art, he nevertheless expressed himself 
in many manifestos about ideas relating to new art forms. He sought verbal ex- 
planations wherever visual means were inadequate. The theories he postulated 
were meant for the future and transformed into creative acts only by subsequent 
generations. "All depends upon ideas, upon the cut and the gesture" he said in 
1966. When he proposed to show a single painting in one room, it was Fontana's 
objective to completely realize an idea through his gesture. 

As early as 1948 he wrote "art is eternal but not immortal." And "art dies but 
is saved by gesture." He was aware that art was the hostage of matter and that 
sub species eternitatis a millenium is but a moment. As a result he cared little 
whether a work of art lived only for a moment or lasted two thousand years. Such 
concepts, first expressed by the Dadaists, were new again and radical by 1948. 
They already anticipated the art form of the Happening which did not appear for 
another decade. 

By 1947 Fontana spoke of Concetti or concepts, long before the notion of an 
art of ideas or conceptual art gained currency. At a very early date Fontana 
also took into consideration the creative opportunities presented by television. In 



'" 



195 2 5 when he read his Manifesto del movimento spaziale per la televisione, he 
stated that "television is one of the long awaited means that will enable us to inte- 
grate our conceptions." In 1948 he ventured that "Art no longer develops through 
the use of stones and colors. A new art must make use of light and television- 
techniques that can be transformed into art only by creative artists." The new 
medium was then only in its infancy and the term "video," which today is common- 
place in artist's circles, had not even been coined. Fontana, because he was himself 
possessed of a far-ranging imagination, was acclaimed by a generation of young 
artists as a seminal initiator of new creative concepts. This also explains the rele- 
vance his work still retains. That he is, at the same time, considered a modern 
classic is not inconsistent with such relevance, since in our era of short-lived 
generations, artistic ideas succeed one another rapidly. 

Fontana's oeuvre shines out in other respects as well. It is still wholly informed 
by the serenity of a painterly vision in spite of all its revolutionary notions. Fontana 
is one of the first artists since Malevich to pay homage to monochrome painting. All 
of his first perforated paintings around 1949 are white, and it still seems appropriate 
to note in passing how much an artist like Yves Klein owes to this new awareness of 
monochrome which Fontana reintroduced into painting. In the 1950's it was hardly 
possible to imagine a more rigorous asceticism than the reduction of pictorial 
means expressed by Fontana when he made an incision on a monochromatic plane. 
Implicit in this acesticism is a new grasp of painterly subtleties. As we know from 
his photographic portraits, Fontana was a man of rare noblesse, a noblesse which 
also characterized his paintings. This quality, all too rare in our time, is supported 
by the detached objectivity of a sovereign spirit.
