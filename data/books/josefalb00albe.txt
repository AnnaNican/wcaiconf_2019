JOSEF ALBERS 

The beautiful pictures of our ugly age should be seen and read 

with the eyes of a child. 

The pictures of Albers are not only a treat for the eye but they also 

convey meaning. 

They grow in profundity as they are looked at with eyes 

uncorrupted, and grasped penetratingly. 

They are like the wood into which one calls and from which it echoes 

as you are called. 

Like nature they are a mirror. 

Each of his pictures has a heart. 

They never break into bits, crumble, turn into dust. 

The are not castigated lashes. 

They have a clear and great content: 

Here I stand. 

I am resting. 

I am m this world and on earth. 

I do not hurry away. 

I won't have anyone harass and exasperate me. 

I am not a frantic machine. 

/ am not faint-hearted. 

I can wait. 

I do not drive myself from the picture into the incommensurate. 

I do not drive myself into bottomless depth. 
Many of my friends and their pictures do no longer want to be here. 
Neither friend nor picture have any longer an existence. 
They want to go to the devil. 
How one longs in their presence for an Albers. 
The world that Albers creates carries in its heart 
the inner weight of the fulfilled man. 
To be blessed we have to have faith. 

This holds also for art and above all for the art of our time. 
Who would have forseen that our earth would he so led by our brain 
to unbelief, to noise, to mechanical frenzy, to carefully recorded 
raggedness, to teleguided disbelief.

Sponsor's Statement 



BASF is pleased to be the corporate sponsor of the 
first major retrospective of the works of Josef Albers. 

Upon his emigration from Germany to the United 
States in 1933, American artists had as yet little ex- 
posure to the advanced trends and ideas then current in 
Europe. Albers became their recognized champion in 
the New World. His achievements served as a major in- 
fluence in the training of artists, architects and designers. 

In later years, Albers's theories on light, color and 
perception influenced computer techniques, particu- 
larly in color control of videos. It can be truly said, 
as the noted art historian Werner Spies remarked, "He 
did not teach painting, but seeing: not art, but the 
psychology and philosophy of art." 



As a company rooted in European pioneering of 
chemical synthesis, BASF is also accustomed to seeing 
the world in new ways. The company's innovativeness 
in science and technology has become well established 
in North America. 

BASF is therefore proud to sponsor this unprecedented 
chronological overview of the rich and varied scope 
of Albers's work at the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum.

Preface and Ac/know ledgments 



Josef Albers was the sum oi man) parts: painter, 
designer, teacher, theoretician. The first of several 
I'). mli. uis facult) members to come to America after 
ih.it school dosed in 19 \ ;. he came to Black Mountain 
C ollege, near Ashe\ ille, North &lt;, arolina, to assume the 
position of professoi ol art. There Ik- taught with his 
w ik- Anni AJbers, the distinguished weaver and herself 
.1 Bauhaus graduate, and developed a curriculum that 
revolutionized art education in America. 

In 1414 the architect Walter Gropius consolidated two 

separate schools of arts and crafts in Weimar to create 
tlie Bauhaus. Gropius was convinced of the need to 
abolish the distinction between tine and applied arts, 
an idea that had ahead) been put into practice in the 
ish arts and crafts movement and the Deutscher 
Werkbund. I he nucleus of Bauhaus teaching was the 
principle that the architect, painter or sculptor should 
b&lt; soundly trained as a craftsman. To that end, the 
school was to be a practical workshop tor design w ith 
emphasis placed on the stuck ,uk\ use of materials. As 
; I leard I lamilton has noted: 

The curriculum was based on Formlehre instruc- 
tion in problems of form) which was arranged in 
three degrees, moving from Observation the 
study 0/ nature and analysis 0/ materials) through 
Representation descriptive geometry, techniques 
and constructions, etc. to ( 'imposition theories 
of space, color and design . 



A focal point of Bauhaus teaching was its preliminary 
course, which was mitialb developed and taught b\ 
Johannes ltten. Albers, who had come to stud) at the 
Bauhaus in 19-0, was united b) Gropius to teach the 
preliminar) course in 1923.111 1928 he took charj 
the course. 

As a result of the growing Na/i threat in Europe, a 
number of the figures associated with the Bauhaus 
emigrated to America and disseminated the principles 
of the school here: Gropius joined the facult) ol 
ird University, 1 aszlo Moholy-Nag) founded the 
new Bauhaus now the Institute of Design of the Illinois 
Institute of Technolog) a\k\ Albers, as we have noted, 
went to Black Mountain C ollege. Albers wrote in 
( ierman in 19 ; ;: 

...the student should first become aware &lt;&gt;f form 
problems in general, and thereby become clear as 
to his own real inclinations ami abilities. In short, 
our art instruction attempts first to teach the 
student to see m the tadest sense: to open his exes 
to the phenomena about him and. most important 
of all. to open to his own living, being, and doing. 
In this connection ire consider class work in art 
studies necessary because of the common tasks 
and mutual criticism.' 

\lbers these studies revealed: "On the one hand 
the intuitive search for and discover) of form; on the 
other hand the knowledge And application of the 



1 1 



fundamental laws of form...." And, as he also noted, 
"All rendering of form, in fact all creative work, moves 
between polarities: intuition and intellect, or possibly 
between subjectivity and objectivity. Their relative 
importance continually varies and they always more 
or less overlap." ' In his own work Albers expressed the 
concepts that he set before his students. 

Albers's continuing investigation of artistic absolutes 
led him to isolate the motif of the square and create his 
most rigorous format in 1950. The Homage to the 
Square series allowed Albers to present color in its 
infinite variations. As he observed in 1952: 

The painter chooses to articulate with or in color. 
Some painters consider color an accompaniment 
of, and therefore subordinate to, form or other 
pictorial content. To others, and today again, in an 
increasing number, color is the structural means of 
their pictorial idiom. Here color becomes au- 
tonomic. 

My paintings are presentative in the latter direc- 
tion. I am interested particularly in the psychic 
effect-esthetic experience caused by the interac- 
tion of colors. 



In 1949 Albers left Black Mountain and in 1950 he 
became chairman of the Department of Design at Yale 
University. At Black Mountain he had invited a wide 
variety of artists to teach during the summer; at Yale 
he asked many distinguished artists to participate in 



the program as visiting critics. The dialogue that Albers 
encouraged at both schools was enhanced by artists 
whose work often differed radically from his own and 
contributed to the fame of each institution. At Yale, as 
at Black Mountain, he organized classes in basic design 
and supervised courses in drawing and color. 

Albers's impact on painting, sculpture and design both 
as teacher and theoretician are undisputed. Many of 
his most renowned students, such as Robert Rauschen- 
berg and Eva Hesse, who became important artists 
developed idioms at odds with Albers's aesthetic. Some 
students, most notably Richard Anuskiewicz and 
Julian Stanczak, directly adapted Albers's theories and 
methods of working to their own ends. The work of 
other artists like Donald Judd, Frank Stella and Sol 
Lewitt-indeed many of the Minimalists of the 1960s— 
owes much to Albers's theories and the example of his 
painting, engraved plastics and prints. Many differ- 
ences notwithstanding, the Minimalist aesthetic, based 
as it is on the use of repetitive units, technologically 
advanced materials and relationships of highly 
simplified forms, is indebted to Albers's ideas. And 
today we are witnessing a revival of geometric painting, 
albeit in a new form, and it seems evident that Albers 
has had an impact on the young adherents of this style, 
among them Peter Halley, Ross Bleckner and Peter 
Taaffe. It is true that the Utopian vision underlying the 
theoretical positions and work of Albers and other 
artists and architects of his generation may not be 
relevant in today's more cynical climate. Neverthe- 



less, Albers's an remains .is valid and vital as ever, a 
totality in and of itself, .1 starting pouu for younger 
generations ol artists. Indeed the effect of Albers's 
influence may still be growing; he ma) be more than 
thf sum of his parts. 

I his exhibition of Albers's lifework marks the centen- 
nial Dt the artist's birth and is the first comprehensive 
retrospective ever devoted to him. Nicholas I ox Weber, 
1 xecutive I &gt;in ctorol I he [osef Albers 1 1 lundation and 
( luesi (. urator of this presentation, selected the works 
shown and contributed the mam essa) to the accom 
panying catalogue, we are extremel) grateful to him 
for his enthusiastic and knowledgeable collaboration. 
Amu Albers, the artist's widow, offered us essential 
support ,\ud ,ul\ ice during all phases of the exhibition's 
organization. We acknowledge Kell) Feene) of the 
Albers 1 oundation for her valuable participation in the 
project. We could not have realized the exhibition And 
the present publication without the indispensable 
ration of the Albers 1 oundation, which shared 
important archival materials and made crucial loans 
available. 

Our deepest gratitude is extended to BAS1 ( orpora- 
t u &gt;n and the Federal Republic of German) tor their 
generous support on this auspicious occasion. 

I he scope ol the catalogue has been greatl) enhanced 
by the perceptive essays written tor it b\ Neal Benezra, 
Mar) i iiim. 1 1 1. in is and 1 harles I . Rickart. We would 
like to thank the mam nuln iduals at the ( iuggenheim 



Museum who worked on the project. Most central 
among these were Susan B. Hirschfeld, Assistant 
Curator, .\nd Thomas Padon, ( uratorial Assistant, 
who were activel) involved in all aspects of the under- 
taking. Carol Fuerstein, Editor, and Diana Murphy, 
Assist. nit 1 ditor, were responsible tor the editing of the 
catalogue and seeing it through the press. 

Mam works m this exhibition have never before been 
shown. They shed new light on previousl) unknown 
or little understood aspects of Albers's career. We were 
therefore dependent on the enlightened generosit) of 
the lenders, both private and institutional, of Albers's 
works, lo all these lenders to Josef Albers: \ Retrospec- 
tive, we express our deepest gratitude.

The Artist as Alchemist 



NICHOLAS FOX WEBER 



To most people he is known as "the square man." For 
the last twenty-five years of his life Josef Albers made 
over a thousand of his Homages to the Square, paint- 
ings and prints in four careful formats that gave color 
an unprecedented voice. He called them "platters to 
serve color": vehicles for the presentation of different 
color climates and various color effects, above all for 
the demonstration of the way that solid colors change 
according to their positions and surroundings. 

The Honiages were quick to enter the mainstream of 
popular life. Simple yet poetic, they were clearly laden 
with significance. They became the subject of television 
specials; magazine articles in Life, Realties and Time, 
as well as endless more specialized publications; the 
basis of cartoons (see figs, i, 2); the core of the first 
one-man retrospective ever given to a major living artist 
at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
One was reproduced on a United States postage stamp 
embodying the motto of the Department of Education, 
"Learning Never Ends." With their neutral format, free 
of history or connotations, not only did the Homages 
show aspects of color that had never before been seen 
so clearly, but they also became a symbol of artistic 
modesty and diligence. Rarely had a secular painter so 
completely suppressed his ego and personal psychol- 
ogy to embark on such a rigorous course of repetition 
in service of a single cause. But in fact he was not 
totally secular; although Albers may not have used 
known religious imagers, what he evoked through 
color is magical and intensely spiritual. 



While Albers's reputation is based primarily on the 
Homages to the Square, he did not begin them until 
1950, when he was sixty-two years old. His previous 
work was in much the same vein. From the start Albers 
had extolled visual nuance and mixed playfulness with 
formalism. Still Life with Russian Box, ca. 1914 (cat. 
no. 4), one of his earliest known oils, shares many traits 
with the Homages. Ideas that would eventually be the 
main point appear in their incipient form in this early 
painting. Solid colors are surrounded by solid colors. 
Darker ones make lighter ones look brighter yet. Broad 
planes have been foreshortened to intensify their 
impact; the shifts between them are abrupt and star- 
tling. Like the Homages, Russian Box presents a 
limited number of elements with the portent of high 
drama. 

Here and in the roughly contemporaneous Masks and 
Vase, 1916 (cat. no. 5), Albers had already learned to 
go his own consistent way. In Masks and Vase, as in 
his much later series of linear geometric drawings 
called the Structural Constellations (see cat. nos. 171- 
176), he set a plane at right angles to the overall shape 
with uncanny effect. Again his later themes prevail - 
you're not sure what you're seeing; blacks and whites 
sharpen their teeth against one another; red looks one 
way in white surrounds, another in black. Moreover, 
the painting is unusual and haunting; it doesn't look 
quite like anyone else's. The subject and contortions 
conjure Nolde, Ensor and Picasso's Les Demoiselles 
d'Avignon; the background hints at certain Blaue

Albers was born in 1888 m Bottrop, .1 bleak mining 
cit) in the highly industrialized Ruhr River region of 
Germany. He w.is the son of .1 laborer, forever proud 
of the standards of craftsmanship that dominated his 
childhood. When asked late in his life about his 
working methods tor the Homages, he would often 
explain that he always began with the center square 
because his lather, who, among other things, painted 
houses, had instructed him as a young man that when 
you paint a door you start in the middle and work 
outward. "That way you catch the drips, and don't get 
your cuffs dirty." Albers revered his practical education 
and always stressed its preeminence over more esoteric 
influences that art historians tried to pm on him.

ing, ^lass etching, ^lass painting, everything. Ih 
had a very practical mind. I was exposed to many 
handlings that I learned to steal with my eyes) 

Albers was proud that his mother descended from a 
line of blacksmiths. "To make a good nail tor a 
horseshoe, it u.is necessan to have skill of the hand." 
That dexterity is evident in the entire range of his art, 
from the earl) oils through the Structural Constella- 
tions mk\ Homages to the Square. I he concern with 
tive methods and proper technique remained 
imperative to 1 orenz and Magdalena Albers's son not 
onlv in his work, but also in his teaching, an area in 



'5 



which he made some of his greatest contributions. In 
Germany at the Bauhaus, and in America at Black 
Mountain College and Yale University, he taught 
students that technical mastery was the imperative that 
must underlie all artistic endeavor. Whatever one's 
artistic bent, it was necessary to develop the ability to 
write one's name in mirror script, as well as upside 
down and upside down in reverse. Without skills of 
this sort, there was no more chance of success than 
there would be for a musician who could not recognize 
proper pitch and play scales, or an athlete who did not 
exercise and was not in shape. As a printmaker Albers 
would learn to manipulate woodblocks, study the 
application of lithographic inks and pursue virtually 
all modern methods; as a painter he would develop his 
hand so as to be able to apply paints straight from the 
tube, with a painter's knife, to abut one another 
without overlapping along clean-edged boundaries. 

Albers had his early schooling in Bottrop and con- 
tinued his education in other towns in the region, 
Nordrhein-Westfalen. In 1908 he graduated, at the age 
of twenty, from the Lehrerseminar (Teacher's College) 
in Biiren, where for three years he had been trained as 
a teacher. His grades ranged from "sufficient" in 
French, musical harmony and gymnastics, to "good" 
in agricultural instruction, history and nature studies, 
to "very good" in conduct, diligence and drawing- 
fairly precursory of his future strong points. That same 
year he made his first visits to museums in Hagen and 
Munich, where he had his initial, crucial exposure to 
the work of Cezanne, Matisse, van Gogh and Gauguin. 

Following his graduation from Biiren, Albers held a 
scries of positions teaching elementary school in small 
Westfalian towns and back in Bottrop. Then, in 1913, 
he went to Berlin to study the teaching of art for two 
years at the Konigliche Kunstschule (Royal Art 
School). It was in Berlin that he began to think of 
himself as an artist. He produced a number of figura- 
tive oils (some of which have since disappeared) in 
addition to Russian Box, as well as some remarkable 
drawings. Farm Woman with Kerchief, ca. 1914 (cat. 
no. 1 ), the earliest drawing in this exhibition," shows 



the effect of the sort of drawing technique he must have 
observed in Durer's work in the Kaiser Friedrich 
Museum in Berlin. Albers by this time could draw 
competently. He rendered the woman's profile and the 
details of her knotted scarf and bun with authority and 
freedom. The head reads as a complex and convincing 
sequence of curves. And there is ongoing motion here- 
between left and right as well as foreground and 
background-of the type that recurs frequently 
throughout the body of his work. 

The approach of Diirer as well as Holbein is also 
evident in a self-portrait oil of about 1915 (cat. no. 3). 
Like these other Northern artists, Albers distanced 
himself from the subject even when it was his own face. 
When he made this painting of himself, Albers was in 
his late twenties-an age when self-obsessiveness is 
often extreme-yet he approached his own individual- 
ity with that same eye for generalized phenomena that 
marks his late color exploration. His attitude at the 
beginning was what it would be fifty years later; he 
took hold, becoming the one in charge rather than 
succumbing to the emotional sway of what he was 
presenting. This self-portrait puts us face to face with 
the image, unequivocally, making it a formal visual 
experience rather than any kind of biography, or- 
worse yet, from the artist's point of view-psychobiog- 
raphy. If the Homages were "platters to serve color," 
Albers looks like a soldier to serve art, his steely visage 
a vehicle for balance and symmetry. The painting is 
divided into four rather pale color zones, and, even if 
it is not as abstract and rigorous as the Homages to the 
Square, it is as definite in its formal organization. 

Like the Homages, Self-Portrait juxtaposes upward 
and downward motion; the sloping shoulders succumb 
to gravity, while the head is elevated. The early painting 
is in this way a key to the humanoid character of those 
later abstractions. With their internal squares 
positioned low, the Homages are weighted toward the 
earth much as the human body is; with their ascendant 
upper parts, they, so-to-speak, have their heads in the 
clouds. We, too, place our feet on the ground, and then 
lift ourselves upward, both mentally and physically.

here than meets the eye at first glance. I his mix of a 
strong earthl) base and a transcendent spirituality is a

I he draw ings Albers did after returning from Berlin to 
Bottrop in 1915 suggest the serenirj of going home 
after a time of restless experimentation. In st\ le mk\ 
content, these drawings of 1915-18 are a particular 
surprise to those who are familiar onl\ with his later 
work. In then essence the) are totally of a piece with 
it, in spue of the different nature of the subject matter. 
Visuall) articulate, the) convej their themes with 
minimal, carefull) chosen forms. Most of them 
abound in open space. I here is no clutter: neither 
visual confusion nor personal psychology intrude. Or, 
from another viewpoint, what psychology there is is 
that of an artist who deliberately sought to keep his 
nonartistic sides at bay. At this time and ever after, 
Albers opted for a deliberate detachment: from history, 
from artistic trends, from personal experience. This 
cutting off did not pain him; to those who knew him 
well it was clear that his life as an artist was almost all 
that mattered to him. I he tenor of his work did not 
alter in response to historical events or fluctuations m 
private or professional relationships. Connections 
between the character of his art and the state of his 
emotional life— the sort of links that exist between 
lV.isso's \arious artistic phases and his tumultuous 
life— have no bearing. Emotional circumstances 
shed no more light on Albers's art than on the formula- 
tions of I instein. 

But the drawings are not cold. They suggest deep 
affection tor what the) represent. The) are also full of 
grace and virtuosity. While bowing slighth in the 
direction of certain historical and contemporar) styles, 
Albers kept his sights focused on his own objectives. 
Dexterous technique and true but economical evoca- 
tion of the subject matter were of paramount impor- 
tance. The high-spirited drawings of schoolgirls see 
cat. nos. [6-18 are carefree in tone but present \ital

artist-a simplification and intensification of detail, 
meticulous attention to the assemblage ot elements - 
alread) shine. So does the almost m\ stical reverence tor 
what can be taken in with our eyes. 

What is curious, considering the qualit) ot these 
drawings, is that he kept them secret throughout his 
lite. While most ot Albers's figurative prints from the 
same years were all later exhibited .md included in 
publications,' all but a do/en of over a hundred 
figurative drawings were complete!) unknown, even to 
the scholars and critics with closest access to his art. 
But at least he saved them tor posterity, in carefull) 
marked folders. This exhibition is their first public 
show ing. 

While he was living and teaching in Bottrop between 
1916 and [918, Albers took courses at the Kunstgewer- 
beschule School tor Applied Arts in nearb) Essen. He 
did several series ot linoleum-cut prints and litho- 
graphs there. Better known than the draw ings, and 
somewhat similar to them, the linoleum cuts si 
;, 4 have been linked to the work ot main artists, 
including the German Expressionists and Dclaun.n." 
They raise the question of the degree to which Albers's 
earl) visual vocabulary was dependent on the work of 
others. Viewpoints range from the artist's total denial 
ot most influences to art historians' exacting claims. 
The art historian 111. Gombrich, who writes about 
Albers specifica II) in FbeSi and implicit!) 

in Art and Illusion, got to the essence ot this qiu 
in a discussion we recently had. "There may have been 
a little bit ot Zeitgeist there," but the idea ot an often- 
mentioned connection to Expressionism, to the work 
of kirchner And othei artists, is "nonsense."

Albers inevitably used aspects of the language of his 
time, but, whatever the slight superficial resemblance 
to the work of the Expressionists, he was far more 
controlled and far more personally distanced from his 
response to his subject matter than they. His primary 
concerns were with rendering the visual theme and 
exploring the materials of art. Gombrich addressed this 
second point as well: "You can submit to materials, 
which is the ideology of the truth to material. Or you 
can display your mastery in making the material 
submit to your will. Albers knew both." 5 These prints 
are intensely flavored by the tactile possibilities of the 
linoleum gouge-we practically feel the tool cutting 
through -as well as by the rich ink coverage. But the 
means are always in service of the neutral rendering of 
the subject matter: mine, nave or head. 



The artists whose work seems to have affected Albers 
significantly by this time were Cezanne and the 
Cubists. In his personal chronology, which he often 
rewrote throughout his lifetime, he always listed as the 
pivotal event of 1908 his initial encounter with 
Cezanne's art in the Folkwang Museum in Hagen. By 
1 9 15 he had seen Cubist works in Berlin as well as 
through reproduction. From then on Albers took a new 
approach to the presentation of so-called reality and 
used planes to suggest movement. The technique of a 
ca. 1917 self-portrait drawing preparatory to a litho- 
graph (cat. no. 15) distinctly reflects Cezanne's 
works and Cubist methods. Having sketched the right 
profile, mouth, eyes and a few other details with the 
point of his lithographic crayon, Albers then used its 
side to construct, very subtly, a sequence of adjacent 



[8 



planes thai describe most oi the subject, ["here is

reductiveness, the restless life oi line.

street. I he lower middle-class neighborhood oi a bleak

subject that, like a flat undifferentiated square or a dull 
brown hue, is not necessaril) appealing. Perhaps 
through his remarkable neutrality— he was, after all,

spent most ot his lite until that point, yet we have no

In 1 918, when World War 1 ended, Albers had a chance 
to travel. He made drawings in some of the small towns 
of the Miinsterland (see cat. no. 32), in Cologne and 
Wiirzburg, and in one case in the Sauerland, the region 
where his family originated and his grandmother lived. 
Pine Forest in Sauerland (cat. no. 3 3 ) is one of his most 
careful drawings. The dense, short strokes that form 
the distant background are opened up with larger 
intervals in the foreground: black and white have 
telling roles in distinguishing near and far. And white 
equals light; it becomes dappled sunlight on tree trunks 
and between leaves on the forest floor. Albers would 
respond to the different voices of black and white 
throughout his work. He would play them against one 
another, and allow each to perform in fullest force on 
its own. Here their interaction creates both matter and 
void. It is the basis of a living world that is at once airy 
and succoring. 

In 1919 Albers went to Munich, to study at the Konig- 
liche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst (The 
Royal Bavarian Academy of Pictorial Art). What he 
valued was the painting technique class he took with 
Max Doerner. He gave little credit to his study of 
painting and drawing with Franz von Stuck, with 
whom his future Bauhaus confreres Paul Klee and 
Vasily Kandinsky had worked over a decade earlier. He 
disliked Stuck's practice of having students draw from 
the figure, which as a teacher he eventually disavowed. 
("They teach them in front of naked girls to draw. 
When they called me to teach at Yale, I saved them 
$7,000 a year for models.") Yet his drawings of nudes 
are impressive. He knew how to get the life and twist 
of the torso, and when to stop (see cat. nos. 37- 



39). In a loose and free style, he could articulate the 
curves with total accuracy. 

While he was living in Munich, Albers made some 
brush and ink views of the Bavarian mountain town 
of Mittenwald (see cat. nos. 34, 35). These exuberant 
drawings are the work of a man who was breathing 
deeply in the mountain air and who had the ability to 
turn the free sweeps of his brush into hills and build- 
ings, into mass and void. The Bottroper gone south 
was feeling his power. So much so, that in little time 
he would have no problem giving everything up for a 
new place, new people and a radically different form 
of art. From here, he might go anywhere. 



n 

/ was thirty-two . . . threw all my old things out the 
window, started once more from the bottom. That 
was the best step I made in my life. 

In Munich Albers saw the simple four-page pamphlet 
describing the new Bauhaus school in Weimar. The 
pamphlet had on its cover a woodcut by Lyonel 
Feininger of a Gothic cathedral that symbolized the 
integration of all the arts, and a statement by Walter 
Gropius, the founding director of the school, stressing 
proficiency in craft. Albers quickly arranged funding 
from the regional teaching system of Nordrhein- 
Westfalen, with which he was still affiliated, and 
headed to Weimar. 

He had been a hometown schoolteacher and in his 
spare time a figurative artist; even when he had the 
chance to break away to the big cities to study art, he 
had worked within the accepted mode of representa- 
tion. Suddenly he was an abstract artist. There was 
nothing he wouldn't try. He was in a different orbit, 
and the possibilities were endless. 

Albers arrived at the Bauhaus in 1920, a year after the 
school had been founded. Once there, he assembled 
broken glass shards to extract a radical and startling 
beauty from them. He juxtaposed flat planes of wood 
in sharp geometry to make furniture that was boldly 



11 



and toughl) functional. 1 ater, after the Bauhaus moved 
!• i 1 tessau, he bent wot id to create chairs thai could be 
assembled in minutes and were .is simple and elegant 
.is the) were portable. He designed an alphabet as 
different from ir.ulitioii.il German script as the new 
aircraft from the [unkers factor) near the Dessau 
Bauhaus were from a horse and buggy. I le sandblasted 
glass to mi ike smoothness and radiant tones, 
making art w ith no reference w hatsoever to the known 
world, but with .1 power and energ) all its own. I [&lt; 
bent metal into fruit howls and tea glasses whose 
shapes still look new sixt) vcars Liter. In Dessau and 
m Berlin after the Bauhaus moved there, he taught an 
unprecedented approach to form and the possibilities 
ot materials. 

I he Bauhaus opened new worlds to the young Westfa- 
lian. 1 le danced at the festivals. 1 le made friends from 
all over, e\entuall\ with some ot the artistic pioneers 
ot the century. 1 le tell in love w ith And married a young 
woman from Berlin who had departed as radically 
from her childhood world comfortable, tradition 
hound as he had from his own past. 

I he stor) ot the Bauhaus has been told repeatedly. 
|oset Vlbers was there tor longer than anyone else- 
from 1920 until the time ot its closing in [9 ; ;. 1 low 
much ot his creative evolution and achievement ot 
those years depended on what was intrinsic to Albers 
And how much was realized because ot the school 
itself— is impossible to determine. What is dear, how- 
ever, is that as radical as his break was, he did not 
really, as he claims, throw even thine out the window. 
Nietzsche wrote, "It a man has character, he has also 
his typical experience, which always recurs." Vs 1 
draftsman Albers had alread) chosen to avoid orna- 
ment and use the most economical means; at the 
Bauhaus he continued along the same path. From rhe 
start he had played flat planes against illusions ot three- 
dimensional space; now he explored that dev ice in new 
wavs. lie had previousl) succumbed to the enchant- 
ment ot the hl.uk mav w hite spectrum; now he mvesti- 
gated it further, abandoning the encumbran&lt; 
subject matter. It / he Green Flute and other earh 



works are, as Georges Duthuit said ot his tat her- in- law 
Henri Matisse's drawings, "mirrors on which the 
artist's breath is barel) perceptible-bel canto, without 
dissonance," Albers's work of the Bauhaus years also 
reveals little of the man himself And exalts technical 
finesse and v isual harmony. 

When he first arrived at the Bauhaus, Albers could 
scarcel) afford materials. Documents in the town hall 
in Bottrop give voice to his extreme financial stress 
during those earh vears. lime And again he had to 
appeal to the regional teaching system to keep up his 
funding. 1 le would periodicall) assure the officials that 
after just a bit more training at the Bauhaus he would 
return to his schoolteaching in Bottrop— a promise he 
clearly had no intention of keeping. I he duress that 
might have been the dominant theme ot another man's 
Arx became a source ot beauty in Albers's. Unable to 
pav tor paints and canvas, he went to the town dump 
not tar from the Weimar Bauhaus, pickaxe in hand and 
rucksack on his back. He returned with glass shards 
that he assembled into works of art see cat. nos. 40- 
4; . What had been garbage became jewels. The 
discards of others were now arranged with care into 
balanced compositions that set up ongoing rhythms 
and interplay. Resurrected, the elements rook on the 
lite and dynamism the) lacked when the) lav on the 
ground. And light— the medium ever dear to theartist- 
penetrates the colors in hill force. That light functions 
much as rhe copious blank spaces of rhe earh draw ings 
do, not onh imparting luminosity but also creating An 
upbeat, positive mood. Years later, in the Horn 
Albers would prime his panels with six to ten coats ot 
white gesso to create light ot the same sort, a neutral 
and generous ground that would allow colors to show 
themselves freely. 

The Bauhaus masters told Albers he had to studv wall 
painting. I le refused. At the vnd of his second semester, 
Gropius "reminded me several times, as was his duty, 
that I could not stav at the Bauhaus it I persisted in 
ignoring the aJ\ ice of nn teachers to engage first of all 
in the wall-painting class." Albers, however, continued 
to work with bottle shards on flattened tin cans and 



11 



wire screens, and showed diem in the required exhibi- 
tion of his work at the end of the second semester. "I 
felt that my show would be my swan song at the 
Bauhaus.... But soon thereafter I received a letter from 
the Masters' Council informing me, first, that I could 
continue my studies at the Bauhaus and, secondly, 
asking me to set up a new glass workshop for them. 
Thus suddenly I got my own glass workshop and it 
was not long before I started to get orders for glass 
windows." 4 Between 1922 and 1924 he did windows 
for the Bauhaus director's office in Weimar, the Otte 
and Sommerfeld houses-both designed by Gropius- 
in Berlin, the Grassi Museum in Leipzig and the 
Ullstein Publishing House in Berlin. All destroyed 
during World War II, the only records of these windows 
today are photographs (see cat. no. 45A,b). Vibrant 
and highly charged, their designs must have added a 
vivid sense of the new to the structures they graced. 



Increasingly drawn to regularity and systematization, 
Albers soon organized his glass work with a rigorous 
geometry. Grid Mounted 10 of 1922 (cat. no. 44) 
depends, obviously enough, on a grid. Later he would 
elaborate on the grid in myriad ways, using it as the 
basis for highly refined compositions. But here it is 
plain and simple, with the resultant motion up and 
down and left and right. Albers had incorporated a 
checkerboard within his Sommerfeld house window; 
now the motif was sufficient unto itself. For Grid 
Mounted, he filed down glassmakers' samples to small, 
uniform squares which he bound together with fine 
copper wire within a heavy iron grill. 

Checkerboards come and go as themes. They recur in 
ancient art and in American nineteenth-century 
hooked rugs. The Cubists had employed the motif in 
the early teens and Johannes Itten had used it as a 
teaching tool in the Bauhaus Vorkurs (preliminary 
course) between 19 19 and 192 }. Klee was to explore it 
extensively later in the decade. In any event, Albers's 
checkerboard has its own alchemy. Up front in material 
and technique, with the underlying units nothing more 



or less than a tradesman's selling tools, Grid Mounted 
has a celestial radiance. With his practical absorption 
and eye for the most effective means of making some- 
thing happen-here the creation of vigorous movement 
through color juxtapositions-he achieved eloquent 
results. His first foray into the effects of pure, flat, 
unmodulated color-and his most carefully planned 
composition to date- it richly anticipates the Homages 
that came some thirty years later. This is Albers's 
earliest assertion that he valued squares in and of 
themselves. 

Albers's new awareness of his own preferences contrib- 
utes to the quality of jubilation in the piece. The artist 
had thrown himself into the making of Grid Mounted 
with the eagerness of one who had found his way. 
Having discovered the grid, what delighted him was to 
breathe life into it. In an ordered, regular world his 
imagination was boundless; those tied down squares 
of color are full of surprises, totally free-spirited 
without ever violating their boundaries. How like 
Albers himself, especially as he was later in life: the 
ultimate law-abiding, tax-paying, good citizen, his 
lawn neatly mowed, his bills promptly paid, who never 
hesitated, while obeying the rules, to dare the outra- 
geous. Grid Mounted is euphoria within the confines 
of structure. 



In 1925, after the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, Albers 
was made a master. He was among the first students 
to be so elevated. The appointment put him in a 
position to ask for the hand in marriage of Annelise 
Fleischmann, the weaving student with whom he was 
to share the rest of his life. In Weimar, in addition to 
working in glass, he had made furniture and taught 
practical workmanship to basic-design students. He 
continued all these activities in Dessau. Eventually he 
became head of the preliminary course and director of 
the furniture workshop; he also explored metalwork 
and graphic design. 

It was in the medium of glass, however, that Albers's 
art was developing most fully. By 1926 he had turned 
completely from assembling shards and fragments to 



using Hashed glass. He invented a technique tor 
sandblasting layers of opaque glass thai were fused— or 
Bashed— together sec cat. nos. 55-60, 62-66, &lt;&lt;^ 74, 
96, " s . 99 . He started with a stun ol opaque, pure 
white milk-glass coated with .1 hair-thin layer o( glass 
in .1 second col&lt; &gt;r: red, yellow, black, blue or gray. I he 
from color was melted on bj blowing the glass a 
second rime. On top of it AJbers placed .1 stencil cut 
from blotting paper; then he sandblasted with a 
compressed aii Mower to remove all the areas ol the 
surface that the stencil allowed to remain exposed 

Sandblasting enabled him to obtain sharper contours 
than would have been possible to achieve through 
chemical treatment with acids. After removing the 
stencil, he generally added another color with paint 

often a glass painter's black iron oxide . finally he 
baked the entire piece m a kiln to make the paint 
permanent. I here were variations on the process. 
Intense sandblasting would reveal the milk-glass back- 
ground see tor example cat. nos. - ;. &gt;iS ; sandblasting 
tor a shorter time would dull a top layer of black to 
produce a dark mas see cat. no. 95 . Sometimes Albers 
used more than one stencil on a single work. 

Much as he would when he painted the Ho 
the \,j:un\ the artist thrived on both the limitations 
and the possibilities of the program he had de\ ised for 
himself. In America, at the time he was working on the 
Homages, he reminisced about the glass constructions 
in a wa\ that stressed the links between the two bodies 
ot work. "The color and form possibilities .ire \er\ 
limited. But the unusual color intensity, the purest 
white and deepest black and the necessar) preciseness 
as well as the flatness of the design elements otter an 
unusual and particular material and form effect." In 
glass he made constructions ver) dosel) related to one 
another, adding or deleting Onlj one or two elements 
line or color to make variations m rhythm and 
movement see cat. nos. 69 72 . His careful probing of 

the multiple uses of the same Stencil elements led to 
subtle vet bold permutations. 

I he sandblasting method enabled Albers to achieve the 
detachment he preferred and which he considered 



requisite tor the optimal functioning of color and form, 
excepi in the painted parts ot these compositions, the 
artist's hand is nowhere evident. Albers sometimes did 
not even execute the pieces himself. Rather, he designed 
them in his studio and had them made in a commercial 
workshop— in Leipzig when the Bauhaus was still in 
Dessau, and in Berlin once the school moved there. 

The medium ottered maximal mtensirv and sheen, lake 
cut icvvels, the glass constructions are both radiant and 
pristine— and at a remove from everyda) textures and 
substances. I hat quality and fineness ot material 
emphasize the elevated status of art. "Instead ot using 
colored glass to decorate, to create atmosphere, or to 
praise God, Albers isolated color from the effects &gt;&gt;t 
light, and glass from its architectural context, thus 
exalting color, man and machine."" It was one thing 
to use transparent glass tor a stained-glass window to 
serve the idea ot holiness- Albers had made such a 
window tor St. Michael's church in Bottrop in [916- 
but to use this even bolder sort ot multilavered glass 
foi abstract art was a radical departure. It fixed 
abstraction into confident materiality. It gave 
heightened status to nonobjective form. Interlocking 
lines and solids were put on a par with religious 
imager) -deemed worth) ot careful premeditation and 
exacting execution in a marvelous and mysterious 
substance generall) used to treat miraculous events, 
the process of light passing through glass long having 
been seen as an analogue to the Immaculate (. oncep- 
rion and hoi) radiance in general. 

Albers was able to achieve light ot a striking qualit) 
w ith the opaque milk-glass. It is, in tact, a light reflected 
off an opaque surface that gives the illusion of being 
light shining through a translucent medium. We feel as 
it the mam light source is behind the object, whereas 
in reahtv it comes from the side that we are on 
although back lighting can be an important secondary 
source . Albers outdid nature in these flashed-glass 
pices. He used opaque glass to create an apparent 
translucenc) more powerful than actual translucency, 
and he made reflected light appear to be light coming 
from a direst sou- 



This is the sort of artifice he later explored in Interac- 
tion of Color, the book he published in 1963 which has 
influenced the study of art throughout the world. For 
centuries artists had tried to render light accurately, to 
capture the truth of its appearance in forms as various 
as the mirror-like surfaces of sixteenth-century Flemish 
painting or the fragmented impasto of Impressionism. 
Albers admired the ability of these earlier artists to 
control the appearance of light effects and to create 
illusions of luminosity. However, his concern was not 
faithfulness to nature but rather the taking of matter 
into his own hands and making something happen in 
art that would not occur in reality. 

What results is a deliberate artificiality-. The colors and 
light quality are as explicitly manmade, as distinctly 
invented and unrelated to the natural world as the 
arrangements of carefully ruled and premeditated 
shapes. His three versions of Skyscrapers of 1925 to 
1929 (cat. nos. 64-66) -made with identical stencils on 
different types of layered glass-have textures and color 
tones unlike any in nature or, for that matter, earlier 
art. This is deliberate fiction, based on the latest 
technology. Like the Homages to the Square which are 
so blatantly dependent on manufacturers' paints and 
machine-made panels and were developed in labora- 
tory-like conditions, it extols the unique capabilities of 
the most modern artistic methods. The artist has taken 
as much control as possible. In the earlier glass work, 
variables are at play in the irregularities of found glass 
and the changing nature of the light that passes through 
it. But now the artist has really taken the helm; nothing 
can alter; little is subject to chance. If Braque's and 
Picasso's Cubist collages, Schwitters's Merz pieces and 
the achievements of the Dada group all reflected the 
inherent vagaries of human life and depended to an 
overwhelming degree on the element of chance, Albers 
and many of his Bauhaus confreres wished to assert 
their control over their environment. Rather than 
assemble industrial detritus, they developed industrial 
processes for their own ends. With the magic of right 
angles and a carefully organized geometry, they show 



the unique and triumphant possibilities of a manmade, 
premeditated harmony. 

The flat planes of the glass constructions relate to De 
Still and Russian Constructivism. De Stijl was in the 
air; Theo van Doesburg lectured at the Bauhaus. 
Albers, however, was not one of his admirers. "We had 
right away a clash... that cruel insistence on just 
straight lines and right angles. It was for me just 
mechanical decoration. So we came apart... no, bet- 
ter... we never joined." 1- There was some resemblance 
between van Doesburg's and Albers's work-Albers 
was clearly not averse to using straight lines and right 
angles- but he found van Doesburg's paintings, like 
much other geometric abstraction with which his own 
art has been erroneously linked, limited to the point of 
being empty. A closer connection is to Piet Mondrian, 
with whose work Albers certainly was acquainted at 
the time, and whom he came to know personally in 
America, where he invited him to exhibit at Black 
Mountain College. Mondrian's idea of "the living 
rhythm" achieved by a balance of properly propor- 
tioned lines and angles pertains to the full range of 
Albers's art from the glass works through the Variant 
series of the late 1940s and early 1950s and the 
Homages. So does his notion that "abiding equilibrium 
is achieved through opposition and is expressed by the 
straight line (limit of the plastic means) in its principal 
opposition, i.e. the right angle."' 1 Albers never used 
the term Neo-Plasticism in reference to his own ambi- 
tions, but he adhered to some of its tenets, like the idea 
that "to be concerned exclusively with relations, while 
creating them and seeking their equilibrium in art and 
in life, that is the good work of today, and that is to 
prepare the future." 14 Those who knew Albers may 
question the perfection of his personal relationships - 
he did not exactly thrive on their inevitable variables- 
but time and again he claimed the link between moral 
behavior and the attributes of his own work. He saw 
his art as representing an ideal for the integration of 
the individual in society both in its tone and in the 
simultaneous independence and interdependence of its 



M 



tonus and colors. I le surel) would have subscribed t&lt;&gt; 
Mondrian's view thai "Equilibrium, through .1 con- 
trasting and neutralizing opposition, annihilates indi- 
viduals as particular personalities." lb be neutral 
rather than subjective, to voice universal truths rather 
than person. il experience, vvas of pivotal importance 
to both artists. 



The sandblasted glass constructions arc based on the 
kind of planning and preparation that would mark 
Mlvrs's work from then on. Never again did he allow 
spontaneity comparable to that of his early drawings 
to appear in a finished work, ["here are two possible 
interpretations of this development. ( )ne is that he was 
afraid of his emotions .\n&lt;.\ sensuality. I he other is that 
the allegedl) cool art is as tull of life as the figurative 
pieces. 

\\ hat is certain is that from 14:0 on Albers wanted his 
work free of reference to earthly life. The only possible 
exception to this is his photography, but he apparent!) 
regarded this .is separate from the rest of his art since 
he never showed it to others, referred to it or suggested 
that it be included in exhibitions or in publications. In 
even the earliest pre-Bauhaus draw ings, he had avoided 
the extraneous in favor of refinement and simplifica- 
tion; now he went further in his embrace of limitations 
and generalized form. It was a move toward absolutes, 
and tow aid the eternal. 

The fundamental character ot Albers's art was in wavs 
constant and invincible, but its appearance and 
methods from iy:oon were a total departure. Geomet- 
ric abstraction represented a total change for Albers, in 
ke&lt; ping w ith the leap signified bv his entire experience 
of the Bauhaus. lie had come from a provincial 
working-class background; to break from it mni- 
pletely, he had to ■j.n c up as much ot what he had been 
before .is he could. By taking up the new credo, and 
revealing nothing ot his personal experience, he made 
it possible tor the new world ot the Bauhaus to be his. 
fh rough abstraction, people from all over .\n\.\ ot

Stepping stone: first at the Bauhaus, and then in

bv making him instantl) a hero, and where it later led 
him to considerable financial well-being. I he distanc- 
ing ot himself from his past, mk\ subsequent turning to 
.m unprecedented vision .\nd methods, was his means 
ot achieving freedom. The work, appropriately, looks 
like au awakening.

Albers's achievement in furniture design, typography, 
architecture and metalwork is as dependent on the 
machine aesthetic as are the glass works. Here too are 
the cleanly honed edges and flat smooth planes of the 
flashed-glass constructions. Geometric forms respond 
to one another in precise arrangement. Aesthetic 
decisions seem to have been the result of a careful studv 
ot the technical possibilities ot the material. The) 
derive from formal invention rather than from any 
reference to the natural world or organic structures. 

The work in other disciplines is less innovative than the 
glass pieces, but it nevertheless has its striking qualities. 
Essentiall) Albers worked in the current vernacular 
stv le in these realms, contributing to it his ow n eve tor 
simplicity, purpose and scale. In view of what the 
people around him were doing, his accomplishment in 
typography, furniture, metalwork and architecture is 
not startling!) original; it does, however, represent 
considerable refinement of the contemporan idiom. 

There were three periods in which he worked exten- 
sivelv with furniture: 1922-2^, 1926 and 1928-29. In 



Weimar in 1922-23, he made the magazine shelves and 
conference table, since destroyed, that are shown in 
this exhibition in vintage photographs (cat. nos. 46, 
47). Albers designed them, along with some pew-like 
seats, for the reception room outside Gropius's office. 
The table and shelves resemble to some degree Marcel 
Breuer's Bauhaus furniture of the preceding two years. 
Yet Albers's designs are distinctive in both their relative 
airiness and their sureness of form. The voids have a 
sculptural richness. Planes interlock in crisp rhythm. 
The way in which elemental shapes embrace and 
respond to one another clearly betrays the painter's 
eye. And the pieces that he designed around 1926 for 
the Berlin apartment of his and Anni's close friends 
Drs. Fritz and Anno Moellenhoff (cat. nos. 53, 54) are 
wonderfully inventive and surprising in their juxtapo- 
sitions of forms and materials. 

The furniture design for which Albers is best known is 
his chair of 1929 (cat. no. 76). ' It was made of units 
that could readily be assembled and dismantled and 
could fit into a tidy flat box for shipping. These pieces 
of bent laminated wood-veneers that had been 
molded around matrixes and glued -were as thick as 
they were wide. Over the years some fairly grandiose 
claims have been made for this chair: that it represented 
the first use of laminated bent wood in modern furni- 
ture and that the way it came apart and went back 
together was original. 1. Perhaps because Albers was a 
true innovator in the fields of glass and painting, people 
believed he was equally pioneering as a designer of 
chairs. However Heinz and Bodo Rasch, Josef Hof- 
mann and other designers had already worked in bent 
laminates, and knock-down chairs had been made, and 
sold through catalogues, since the mid-nineteenth 
century. In form Albers's chair was very similar to ones 
made between 1924 and 1928 by Erich Dieckmann 
and to some of the tubular steel designs popular at that 
time. What does distinguish Albers's knock-down chair 
is the subtlety of its proportions and the perpetual flow 
of its gracefully modulated right angles. 
A chair design of the preceding year (cat. no. 75) 
incorporates large squares, albeit with rounded corn- 



ers; like Grid Mounted it shows Albers's early affinity 
for the form to which he later paid extended homage. 
The simple forms and relationships give the object a 
purity, and the contrast of its light and dark woods 
makes it quite elegant. Sitting in it, we think of many 
of Albers's attitudes toward life. We are held upright, 
ready to read attentively or talk alertly. We have an 
impression of firmness, of definition. The chair is not 
tough or hostile-the seat is cushioned, the wood 
smooth -but it will not allow us to slouch. While the 
supporting elements give essential structure, a cantile- 
ver causes a slight oscillation; the result is that like most 
of Albers's work, the chair is steady yet vibrant, ground- 
ed yet floating-at once earthly and fanciful. 

In furniture as in glass, Albers moved from largely 
following the dictates of the material to manipulating 
it to suit his will. In the first furniture designs the 
dimensions of the available lumber, like the broken 
bottle fragments in the Weimar dump, had the upper 
hand. He arranged, rather than transformed, them. 
But in the later chairs he bent and molded wood in 
much the same way that he sandblasted multilayered 
glass, respecting the intrinsic properties of the material 
but taking charge of it in a new way. The attitude 
toward material that he had developed in these two 
disciplines by the end of the 1920s was to characterize 
his work forever after. The Homages to the Square 
explicitly honor paints straight from the tube, each 
listed with the manufacturer's name on the back of the 
panel in a way that shows unusual reverence for the 
tools of the trade. Yet despite this meticulous listing 
and the almost scientific method of application, the 
paints in the Homages seem incorporeal and metaphys- 
ical: they become light, atmosphere, mood. Ironically, 
it is the apparently methodical application of the 
medium that facilitates the attainment of this spiritual 
quality. Albers felt that to revel in impasto, to succumb 
to the sensual properties of the medium, would have 
emphasized his own physicality and personal feelings 
and been detrimental to the expression of the cosmic 
and other-worldly dimension. Similarly, in his furni- 
ture, he polished that plain, uncarved wood, and 



16 



avoided blemishes and accidents, to create form that 
seems almost ethereal wink- at the same time offering 
considerable physical comfort. 

Ubers used his chairs in .1 design tor .1 hotel living 
K)( im that represented his one known attempt at space 
planning cat. nos. 92, 9 ; . Although it was reproduced 
m three different publications m the earlj 1930s, 
neither this design nor Albers's drawing ol 1926 for 
two shops for the Ullstein Publishing Company cat. 
nos. ^1,^1 have until now appeared in the literature 
on the artist or in an) ol his exhibitions. I le designed 
the hotel room for the [931 Bauausstellung Building 
I jchibition in Berlin. It was assembled on the second 
floor of the house that 1 iul\\ ig Mies \ .111 der Kohe built 
for that exhibition. I he room spoke m rhe voice ol the 
day, but with its ow n fine proportions and openness 1 &gt;t 
form. And it included one particular!) ingenious touch: 
on the wall, Albers had placed .1 map ol the cit) ol 
Berlin, so that visitors could find their way. One 
wonders wh) this is not always done in big cit) hotels. 

I he I llstem shop designs, meant to be built in rhe area 
ol the Kurfurstendamm in Berlin, point to a fascinating 
and unknown side ol the artist. We know \er\ little 
about them, except that they were reproduced in the 
1927 publication ( )ffset .\n^\ that Anni Albers's mother 
was an Ullstein, the daughter and sister of the men who 
owned the large publishing house. I he shops were 
never built, And there is no record ol them other than 
the reproductions and an accompanying text citing 
Albers's intention that window shoppers should be 
both attracted and protected. I he shop designs look, 
even today, like something out &lt;&gt;t the future. I he) have 
the adventUTOUSness .\nd imagination, as well as the 
total disregard tor tradition, that characterized the 
Berlin of then epoch. It is unfortunate that we have no 
record ol their actual plan and the technical details, 
except tor the lettering tor then simis, which is from 
the alphabet Albers designed in [926 specificall) tor 
outdoor use. 

I hat alphabet, which Albers called his "Kom- 
binationsschrift" cat. no. N , was based enrirel) on 



permutations of circles and rectangles. Here, as in his 
chair designs and his later painting, he restricted 
himself to the bare minimum of underlv mg units. I he 
result is that the letters were easv to construct; ten types 
of pieces-circles, rectangles and combinations of the 
two-were all that was required. While the design is not 
complete!) unique— it relates closel) to other Bauhaus 
typograph) and stencil lettering- it is unusually practi- 
cal and has an appealing aesthetic unity. Albers later 
explained that "these forms were combined in a wav 
that did not collect dust or water or both, and thus 
were tor outdoor use";"" he had caretullv worked out 
the arrangements so that there were no upward facing 
concavities mto which leaves, snow or other elements 
might tall. In addition there were openings to facilitate 
drainage. I lis goal was to outsmart nature. 

Albers also designed a fruit bowl and tea glasses cat. 
nos. 4S, 49A,B . In its use of a shun stainless-steel 
training element with a simple flat ebon) handle 
supporting a thin glass vessel, the tea glass, designed in 
[926, was very similar to one that had been made three 
years earlier at the Bauhaus b) M. Krajewski and W. 
Tumpel. As with the chair, Albers broadened and 
simplified a known form. His tea glasses are more 
restrained and elegant than their predecessors, thanks 
to their use of fewer forms m more graceful proportion. 
And the delicate juxtaposition ot absolute!) minimal 
elements makes the fruit bowl especiall) striking. 



At the Bauhaus Albers had continued his technical 
explorations and further refined his eve. Eloquence and 
simplicity of composition are consistent!) apparent in 
his work of the period. But around the vear 19^0 he 
also immersed himself in visual mischief. For example, 
he pursued the creation of illusor) transparent -a 
theme he would treat in Interaction 0/ ( Him. In works 
such as Flying, [931 cat. no. 94 , he gave the false 
impression that forms overlapped and that one was 
visible through the other. He did this b) finding the 
precise tone that would have been created it these 



-" 



shapes were transparent and superimposed. It thrilled 
the artist to find that art provided experiences that 
nature could not offer. 

Albers also developed forms with multiple, apparently 
contradictory readings. Two-dimensional imagery 
offered possibilities unknown in three-dimensional 
reality, and so we get the ambiguous cylinders of Rolled 
Wrongly, 19 31 (cat. no. 98), and the complex interplay 
of the flashed-glass piece Steps of the same year (cat. 
no. 96). In Steps, the larger steps to the right clearly 
move upward and away to the right; however, the 
smaller steps first appear to recede upward to the left, 
then upward to the right, and then to go up half way 
in one direction and reverse. With their distinct move- 
ment in a single direction, the large steps are an effective 
foil to the more ambiguous course of the smaller ones. 
That image of the smaller steps, related to both Gestalt 
psychology and the art of M.C. Escher, would always 
remain important for Albers. Believing that the original 
glass construction had been destroyed after he left 
Germany, he re-created it in oil in 1935, and had it 
reproduced in screenprint in his retrospective portfolio 
Formulation: Articulation in 1972. The many possible 
readings of the left-hand flight of stairs continued to 
fascinate him, and he repeatedly republished his writ- 
ing about it. Steps is included in much of the literature 
on Albers, generally with the information that the 
original glass construction was destroyed. That original 
has now reemerged, and is included in this exhibi- 
tion. 21 Many qualities are apparent in the 
glass piece that are not clear in either of the later 
versions. For one, the chameleon-like life of the smaller 
flight of the steps is more effective in the glass construc- 
tion than in the other mediums. In addition, the 
original is remarkable in its textural variations: the 
sheen of the jet black plays against the slightly pebbled 
surface of the more matte, grayer black; that lighter 
black, while carefully machined and constant when 
viewed close up, is full of atmosphere and takes 011 a 
white bloom when seen at a distance. The gray is 
altered ad-infinitum as a result of its adjacency to the 
white. Hence Steps— like main of the Homages a three- 



color composition -uses three solid colors to achieve 
the impression of more than three. This glass construc- 
tion shows the enormous life that Albers could wrest 
from three colors and simple forms, and the richness 
with which he could imbue black, white and grav. 

Albers continued to investigate the black-gray-white 
spectrum in some of the Treble Clef works of 1932 to 
1935 (see cat. nos. 100-105). The forms in each of these 
grisaille paintings are almost identical, but rhythm, 
motion and direction all change according to the 
placement of monochromatic tones. At around the 
same time Klee and Picasso, in such works as the 
latter's The Milliner's Workshop (fig. 6), were also 
exploring the effects of light and dark hues in the black- 
white spectrum on spatial motion-an issue that had 
already intrigued both of them previously. Albers 
ventured into the realm of this spectrum in a very 
different way in his photographs and photo-collages 
(see cat. nos. 77-91). Dexterous and unerring in yet 
another medium, he manipulated light and dark 
powerfully and articulately in these works. The photo- 
graphs are rich in linear rhythm and abstract qualities, 
and the photo-collages juxtapose related images 
dramatically. At the same time the photographs further 
indicate the strength as a portraitist and representa- 
tional artist which Albers revealed in his earlier paint- 
ings, drawings and prints. ~~ 



At the Bauhaus Albers formed many of the most 
significant personal relationships of his life. Foremost 
was his marriage to Anni; they remained together until 
the artist's death in 1976. For over fifty years the two 
shared an abiding faith in the pervasive power of art, 
and a reverence for materials and technical proficiency 
(Anni Albers became known as one of the major 
weavers of modern times). They developed a modest 
and functional way of life geared above all to their 
work. Intensely moral in their work standards, humble 
yet confident, they were like a two-person religious 
sect. Particularly during the Bauhaus years, their art 
bore a strong mutual resemblance-a point that has led 



to endless conjecture as to who influenced whom fig. 
- . I ater it diverged in verj different directions, bui the 
work of each was always marked h\ real innovation 
and .1 reverenc imetric abstraction. I he grid, its 

prevalent tightness and order, was p.irt of their shared 
creed. 

Allvrs also became close to some ot his other fellow 
students at the Bauhaus, especialh Breuer mk\ \ lerbert 
Bayer, with whom he Liter maintained connections in 
the United States. Mis relationship with Gropius 
remained significant tor him until the i9^os, when he 
designed murals tor several ot the American buildings 
designed b) the first Bauhaus director. And while he 
had little taste tor the work ot Itten and Laszlo 
MohoK Nagy, he deepl) respected both Klee and 
Kandinsky, with whom he continued to correspond 
warml) after the Bauhaus closed in 1933. Klee and 
Kandinsky, along with Mies van der Rohe, were the

people with whom Albers carried on his most profound 
exchanges about the processes of art. 

Albers was one of the most experimental teachers at 
the Bauhaus. The students in his preliminary course 
say that it influenced them irrevocably. In it he stressed 
the manipulation of materials, particularly the folding 
and cutting of paper to create astounding plastic 
effects. He encouraged students to work creatively with 
cardboard, wire mesh, newspaper, ribbons and other 
substances not formerly thought of as belonging to the 
realm of art. The goal of the course was to develop 
both dexterity and imagination. Albers's own artistic 
achievement demonstrates the extent to which he 
realized the directives of his teaching. 



In 1932 the city legislature of Dessau, dominated by 
the Rightist Radical party, voted to dissolve the 
Bauhaus, of which Mies van der Rohe had become 
director in 1930. The school moved to Berlin, into a 
building that formerly housed a telephone company. It 
was, however, the city of Dessau that continued to pay 
faculty salaries, because the courts had deemed that 
the city's contract with the masters had been termi- 
nated prematurely. On June 15, 1933, the Oberstadt- 
inspektor of the Dessau City Council wrote Josef 
Albers a letter in which he stated: 

Since you were a teacher at the Bauhaus in Dessau, 
you have to be regarded as an outspoken exponent 
of the Bauhaus approach. Your espousing of the 
causes and your active support of the Bauhaus, 
which was a germ-cell of bolshevism, has been 
defined as "political activity" according to part 4 of 
the law concerning the reorganization of the civil 
service of April 7, 1933, even though you were not 
involved in partisan political activity. Cultural 
disintegration is the particular political objective of 
bolshevism and is its most dangerous task. Con- 
sequently, as a former teacher of the Bauhaus you 
did not and do not offer any guarantees that you 
will at all times and without reserve stand up for the 
National State. 1 ''

The Oberstadtinspektor informed Albers that he 
would no longer receive a salary. On July 20, as a result 
of increasing harassment from the National Socialists, 
the Bauhaus faculty, at a meeting in which Albers was 
one of seven participants, voted to dissolve the school. 
Mies van der Rohe notified the Gestapo accordingly. 

At age forty-five Albers was without a job. As a pioneer 
modernist in Nazi Germany he had little hope of 
finding one. Married to a Jew, he must have feared a 
bleak future. Yet his art of the time was as unruffled as 
his life was tumultuous. The prints he made in 193 3 
(see cat. nos. 106-108) bespeak the serenity 7 Albers must 
have lacked but craved. To look at The Sea (cat. no. 
107) is to feel the role of art as a source of personal 



50 



equanimity through technical absorption. AJbers first 
applied a soft linoplate to .1 wooden backing, and then 
incised .1 continuous curve into it before using .1 chisel 
to remove strips of the linoplate on eithei side of thai 
curve to reveal the rich wood grain underneath. The 
processes oi art, and the power ol their result, were the 
mainstay thai assured AJbers'ssun ival, pin sua I .is well 
as emotional. His sense oi his own identity was 
unpen ions to crisis. 

1 here was something increasingly international and 
timeless about Alhers's art. The tonus were familiar to 
main cultures in ancient as well as modern times. It 
the earl) linoleum prints were m ways identifiabl) 
German, and the first oils characteristically of an 
epoch -both in their subject matter and their relation- 
ship, however tenuous, to [ugendstil and I xpression- 
ism- The Sea speaks less clearly of place or era. This 
universality, as well as main ot its \ isual elements, link 
it to Rice's ( )U Man I of [929 fig. 8 , which 

similarly juxtaposes slightly irregular horizontal lines

For both Anni and Josef Albers, art ottered oppor- 
tunities tor a balance and repose less certain in the real 
world; it was an antidote to the pressures of everyday 
In ing. I he emotional detachment from their locale was 
to make transmigration to another society relatively 
easy. In the summer of [933 the American architectural 
student Philip Johnson, who had met Anni and Josef 
.\n^\ seen their work at the Dessau Bauhaus, \ isited their 
Berlin apartment. He asked it they would like to go to 
America. Without giving it more than a moment's 
consideration, they answered yes. Six weeks later, [osel 
received a telegram from Johnson asking it he would 
like to teach art at a new and experimental college being 
formed in Black Mountain. North ( arolina. I he found- 
ers of Black Mountain had approached fohnson in his 
office at I he Museum of Modem \rt in search of the 



name of a teacher who could make art the focal point 
of the curriculum, mk\ he had immediately suggested 
Albers. I here would also be an opportunity tor Anni to 
give instruction in weaving. 

I he Alberses had no idea where North C arolina was; at 
first they thought it might be in the Philippines. Kut they 
cabled back their acceptance, with the warning that 
fosef spoke no English. The reply from the Black 
Mountain faculty was to come anyway. And so began 
the process of obtaining passports mk\ visas, all of which 
they felt went surprisingly smoothly. Unknown to the 
Alberses at the time, the procedures were expedited by 
the C ommittee to Rescue German Artists, a newly 
formed group ot affluent Americans already aware of 
ilities of Nazi Germany. 

Anni and [osef Albers armed in Black Mountain, North 
c arolina, in November \&lt;-&gt; j j, just in time for their first 
American Thanksgiving. They quickly and easily took 
up the teaching and making of art. Language, however, 
was a problem. At first Albers taught with a translator 
at his side. After several weeks Anni, who as a child had 
had .m Irish governess and therefore spoke some En- 
glish, sat in on one of his classes. She noticed that the 
translator, whom she suspected of Nazi sympathies, was 
making Josef sound far more Teutonic and dictatorial 
than he actually did in German. She com meed him to 
go unaided. Since fosef felt that the essence of his 
teaching depended on visual demonstration more than 
words, this did not pose major problems tor him. At 
least he knew the new tongue well enough to state his 
teaching goal with succinct clarity -"to open eyes." 
rhese words were to remain a personal credo of his 
amis as an educator. 

Anni took it upon herself to teach the new language to 
her husband. Sometimes the results were dubious. 
Once, when the two were walking in farm country 
near the college. Josef saw the word "pasture" on a 
signpost and asked his wife what it meant. "That is 
perfectly clear," she replied. "It is the opposite of 
future." But in spite of the rough start, both Alberses 
were eventually to lecture and write books m English 
w ith vast succ 



&gt;' 



The language of art was less troublesome. Albers 
produced a print series (see cat. nos. 109- in) with a 
publisher in Asheville that was very similar to one (see 
cat. nos. 106-108) he had been working on in Berlin 
when the Bauhaus closed. When the Berlin and 
Asheville prints were shown in Italy at the very end of 
19^4, Kandinsky wrote in the preface to the catalogue 
that accompanied the exhibition, "These beautiful 
sheets . . . reflect all Albers's qualities: artistic invention, 
clear and convincing composition, simple but effective 
means: and finally a perfect technique." 24 The work 
embodies points that had become central to Albers's 
teaching and which he articulated in a lecture pub- 
lished at the Bauhaus in 1928. 'An element plus an 
element must yield at least one interesting relationship 
over and above the sum of those elements. " Thus in 
Wings (cat. no. 109), there are not only the left- and 
right-hand configurations, but also the constant in- 
terplay between the two. The viewer becomes engaged 
in a game of opposites. Is the rectangle on the right the 
negative of the one on the left? Why do the horizontal 
stripes on the left appear to be white on black and 
those on the right black on white? What is the nature 
of the strange attraction between the two bodies, 
which resembles the forces exerted against one another 
by two magnets? Relationships of forms are as essential 
to these prints as are relationships of color in the 
Homages to the Square. "Frugality leads to emphasis 
on lightness.... In any form, nothing should be left 
unused, " Albers also wrote in that 1928 essay. In the 
economical Showcase (cat. no. 1 1 1 ) essentially all we 
see are two rectangles-one with its corners flattened— 
and a third configuration in which a single line is 
contorted to create two interlocked beings that appear 
to lean into one another. There is no gravity here, either 
physical or emotional. The larger rectangle appears to 
elevate the whole configuration, the second one to hold 
it down so that everything does not float heavenward. 
We read the composition as chambers within cham- 
bers, as .1 stage, as comedy. A few thin lines, carefully 
positioned, provide endless entertainment. 

Like his earlier glass pieces and the later Homages, the 



paintings Albers executed during the first years after he 
arrived in America (see cat. nos. 112- 117) revel in the 
power of pure, undiluted color. They seem far more 
carefree and improvisational, with their rougher tex- 
tures and forms, than the preceding works, but like 
the earlier pieces they present solid areas of pigment— in 
abstract, nonreferential shapes-that are kernels of 
energy. This new work reveals nothing of the uncertain- 
ties of the artist's life; rather it makes paint and panel 
a source of high spirits. In spite of the appearance of 
randomness in these paintings, their positive mood is 
always the result of conscious decisions. The untitled 
abstraction of ca. 1940 painted on an RCA Victrola 
top (cat. no. 115) demonstrates the precise approach 
that characterizes even Albers's seemingly offhand 
work. Like the forms in so many of Albers's two-figure 
paintings of the thirties and forties (see cat. nos. 126- 
128, 134, 140), the two cloud-like central bodies have 
been conceived with great care. Their colors accentuate 
their personalities. The jaunty pink suits the tall and 
rangey one; the green, somehow a more settled hue, is 
perfect for the stockier, more compact shape. The 
relationship of these bodies elucidates Albers's point 
that the sum of one plus one in art can, in fact must, 
exceed two; the tense void between the two forms is as 
interesting as the forms themselves. 

Albers was at Black Mountain College from 1933 to 
1949. In a world in which oppression was spreading, 
he had come to a haven for freedom and relative 
tranquility. This was his typical move. In a hierarchical, 
class-conscious Germany he had found his way to the 
Bauhaus, an island of intellectual and social ex- 
perimentation. Now, with totalitarianism overcoming 
his homeland, he had arrived in a pocket of America 
free from most of the restrictions of conventional 
middle-class society. Albers's freedom did not come 
just from physical place, however; his independence 
above all derived from his own character. In the 1950s 
he easily, and with total awareness of what he was 
doing, distanced himself from the multiple pressures of 
academia at Yale and of the New York art world to go 
his own route. Luck, along with an intense determina- 



&gt;- 



don to shape his own destiny, enabled him always to 
make his life and work exactl) what he wanted.

from the main elements of the composition while being 
centered by it and dependent on it. Movement outward 
and inward occurs at once, and there are both light- 
ning-like bands and large central masses. And in mask 
and painting alike the contrast of white and black is as 
strong and deliberate as the play of mass against void 
and edge against bulk. 

Three variations on a theme-Bent Black A and B, both 
1940, and Bent Dark Gray, 1943 (cat. nos. 135-137) 
— represent the earliest instance of Albers's deliber- 
ate use of equal quantities of different colors in a single 
composition. This intent is apparent in the pencil 
notation on an oil on paper study for Bent Black A (fig. 
10). Here Albers has carefully worked out the compos- 
ition so that there are precisely forty and one-half 
square-centimeters of each color: the black, the dark 
gray, the white and the light gray border. This strict 
system serves a number of purposes. For one, it sets 
forth restrictions of the sort Albers enjoyed imposing 
on himself. He felt that tough rules, like the poet's 
sonnet and the composer's sonata, by their very nature 
imparted harmony to the end results. He did not expect 
viewers to read the system precisely, but, rather, to gain 
a sense of order and regularity through it. Additionally, 
the use of equal amounts of different pigments dem- 
onstrates an important point about color, which would 
become a central theme of his Variant paintings. Albers 



asked people what color they felt they saw in greatest 
quantity in these works. He was pleased to get different 
answers; there was no right or wrong response, for 
everything depends upon individual perception. One 
person sees more black, another more white. The point 
is that although there are equal quantities of each, the 
properties of the white or black themselves give the 
viewer an erroneous impression. This was what Albers 
called "the discrepancy between physical fact and 
psychic effect," the demonstration of which was an 
imperative of his art. 

Albers used a grid for these compositions in which he 
strictly apportioned color. The notations in the studies 
for Movement in Gray, 1939 (cat. no. 133), show the 
premium he placed on schemata, and how important 
it was for him to be the master of the destiny of the 
picture. For Penetrating B, 1943 (cat.no. 165), he made 
both a full-size hand-drawn grid and smaller drawings 
in which he tested different widths and angles before 
determining the final measurements. Control-perhaps 
in all of its negative as well as positive associations— is 
at the root of all Albers's art. 

Despite his careful forethought, Albers did not eschew 
a degree of spontaneity. Having charted his course, he 
would occasionally succumb to an on-the-spot intrigue 
with paint and surface, which might produce unusual 
textures that could never have been planned in ad- 



54 



vance. I he results of such spontaneity are apparent in 
the nature &lt; &gt;t the paini coverage in works like Penetrat- 
ing H. whose rid) shapes, b) virtue o( their internal 
textures, encompass a mysterious, unfathomable sea. 
\ precise framework yields the infinite. 

Equal and Unequal, [939 ^.u. no. i;^ , is another 
work in which Vlbers deliberate!) pursued ambiguity.

could get ever) thing right w ithout using a rigid format. 
Mere his combination of thoughtful articulation and 
apparent insouciance reached its apogee. 



rhroughout the late thirties and earl) forties Albers 
used identical formats to present different color combi- 
nations, as he had done with several of the glass 
constructions and the Treble &lt; lefs. I he changes in 
color atteet both the internal rhythms and the emo- 
tional climate of the compositions. In the three versions

paintings from 1940, Growing, Layt red, Tierra Verde 
and To Mitla cat. nos. 1 58-141 . In the flow of their 
forms, their use of color to make movement and then- 
vague reference to natural phenomena, these four 
pictures again recall klcc's work. I hev show Albers 



At Black Mountain Albers often had his students use 
autumn leaves to investigate the importance of posi- 
tion, considering both the wa) that the individual 
leaves change according to their relationship to other 
leaves, and the effects of cut-paper backgrounds on 
these leaves. In his own leaf studies of ca. 194 and 
[942 see cat. nos. [47-151 , which have never before 
been on public view, leaves appear to dance, float, fly 
and swim. Position and adjacenc) are shown to be 
laden with possibility. In a collage that is oddly like a 
painting bv Magntte, two leaves are in front 
background that explicitl) represents sea and skv, and 
inanimate objects become majestic presences cat. no. 
150). Albers has painted a sort of shadow box effect 
alongside the leaves so that the) appear to be in relief 
and tilted toward one another, jauntil) conversing 
through the elegant void that separates them. Their 
wings spread, they look as if the) can soar through 
Space. I lere as in much ot Albers's work of the period, 
the imager) ot individuals afloat in a magical universe 
embodies a major goal ot his life And work: the 
achievement of grace And stasis in the presence of the 
spiritual. 



The appearance ot Albers's prints of the early 1940s 
ranges from childlike to precisely machined. In either 
case the results are full ot esprit, bordering on the 
frenetic. In the small drypoint etching Eh-De, [94 
cat. no. [58), named tor the young son ot Anm and 
|oset's Black Mountain C ollege friends and associates 
Theodore and Barbara Dreier see cat. no. !&gt;&lt;■) , lines 
leap and bulge to encapsulate the pudgy toddler. Its use 
ot nothing more than two continuous, unmodulated 
lines recalls the exercise in which Albers mandated his 
drawing students not to lift pencil from paper. The 
issue is how muJi you can get from how little, fwo 






other etchings, both dated 1942, are similarly restric- 
tive yet evocative of their subjects: the etched lines of 
Maternity (cat. no. 157) envelop and succor, while those 
of Escape (cat. no. 156) dart furiously in a way that 
suggests that Albers did not always keep his concern 
about the plight of refugees at a remove from his art. 

The Graphic Tectonic series of zinc-plate lithographs 
and related drawings of 1942 (see cat. nos. 160, 161) also 
range in mood from intensely animated to penetrat- 
ingly calm. Here movement and resolution are com- 
bined within single images. And like the drypoint 
etchings, they achieve compositional complexity 
through minimal means. Their appearance, however, 
is highly mechanical. But for all the exactitude of the 
technique, the movement of their forms is completely 
ambiguous; for all their coolness, they are recklessly 
lively. Configurations that resemble wiring diagrams 
are subtly mysterious. The Graphic Tectonics show that 
Albers himself had achieved the goals of his drawing 
courses at Black Mountain College: a clear head, 
"seeing eyes, and obedient hands." - ' They embody as 
well the merits of discipline and accuracy, and of 
economy of material and labor, which he propounded 
in his teaching. The series also demonstrates the ability 
of "black lines [to] produce gray tones and, for 
sensitive eyes, color."" 8 For example, it is almost 
impossible to believe that the background color of the 
paper is constant in the drawing Graphic Tectonic 111 
(cat. no. 160). Some areas look snowy, some ivory or 
even purple, apparent tonal variations caused by 
Albers's manipulation of parallel lines. Once again a 
scientific, exacting approach yields the unexpected. 

A group of prints from 1944 (cat. nos. 167-T69) gives 
evidence that a clever juxtaposition of elements is the 
key to a transformation of realities. In Tlaloc (cat. no. 
169) a spare configuration of thin, straight lines on top 
of a wood-grained background becomes the Aztec rain 
god, broad-shouldered and all-powerful. In Astatic 
(cat. no. 168) white planes appear as hard and thin as 
sheet aluminum, and seem bent. Although they are 
made of the white paper on top of which the surround- 
ing wood grain has been printed, the planes look as if 



they are in front of the grain, which becomes a 
background of sea and sky. 



J had asked of his painting that it should lead me 
to the understanding and love of things better than 
itself. . . not so much that it might perpetuate their 
beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty 
to me.

In 1947 Albers began what later came to be known, 
by a public more familiar with the Homages, as his 
"other" series. The artist's own nomenclature for them 
is the Adobes or Variants. In the Variants, of which he 
painted perhaps a hundred, he carried further than ever 
before his idea of a series of works in which the form 
remains constant or alters only slightly but the colors 
change radically. Albers had long taken multiple 
approaches to the same problem, but now his system- 
atic pursuit of a single structure reached a new level. 

Albers was driving at certain points in these paintings. 
A change of colors transforms both the emotional 
character and the apparent physical action of forms. 
Two paintings of identical format with different color 
schemes can have radically different effects. Colors 
alter their appearance according to their surroundings; 
a green has one appearance in a sea of pink, and a very 
different one when it abuts somber browns and grays. 
In the Variants Albers demonstrated techniques he had 
used in earlier work and which he was increasingly 
bent on inculcating in his students. These included the 
application of unmixed colors, straight out of the tube, 
directly on the white background but never on top of 
other colors, to create the illusion of transparency. The 
creation of this illusory transparency was the goal of 
an exercise in Albers's color course in which the 
students' task was to find the right "middle" colors to 
give the false impression that a veil-like band was lying 
on top of other forms. He had earlier shown his own 
master)' of this in Flying (cat. no. 94) and would later

u rue- about it in Interaction of &lt; olor. I he Variants also 
demonstrate thai incompatible tonus ol motion can 
appear to occur simultaneously. Man) ol the config- 
urations in these paintings appear to oscillate forward 
and backward, left and right along the picture plane 
and awa) from it into mysterious depths. C learly, to 
contradict realit) and induce the v iewer's disbelief was 
part of the artist's continuing mission. 

Albers devised systems which he used to call " 'mv 
madness, mj insanity" for the different Variant tor- 
mats. Most are based on formulas of the type that 
underlies the Hoit Black paintings. According to these 
systems there are virtually equal quantities of each 
color, or, m souk' cases, equal amounts of three colors 
and precisel) halt as much of two others. It was not 
Vlbers's intention, however, for viewers to recognize 
his formulas. Rather the\ were to think the) saw more 
green than blue or more yellow than gray even it this 
were not true. The idea is that perception and truth are 
not the same. I his is becauseof the super lot it\ ofcolor. 
A devout missionar) of the power of color, Albers 
studied its possibilities ,\Ui.\ gave it as effective a voice 
as he could develop, lie had learned that color can 
deceive; it has qualities that enable it to give the 
impression that there is more or less of it than is 
actuall) present. 

Albers's art both reflected his pedagOg) and nourished 
it. Some of the concepts it reveals were byproducts of 

the purel) aesthetic decisions that went into its making. 
And although the works make certain points, the) are 
tar more than exercises. It is not primarily their 
demonstration ot fascinating principles, but above all 
their formal grace and dramatic color juxtapositions, 
their enticing blend ot serenit) and animation, that 
beckon us. It the Variants serve as exemplars ot 
theories, thev do so in tonus rich in artistic values. The 
frontal Stance ot their tonus, immobile and fluid at the 
same time, and their effect as reduced reliefs, which 
recalls the shallow bas-reliefs &lt;»t the sandblasted glass- 
constructions, transfix us.

Variant: I Laboured detail of reverse . u;4 - -s: 
C ollection Don Page, New iork 



I list, from the back fig. 11 , we can learn about its 
technical makeup, and hence its didactic side. I [ere 
Albers, in very neat small senpt, wrote his recipe. lb 
begin, there were four coats of white, with varnish 
mixed in. ["hen came the colors. Starting with the large 
pinkish area and working outward, there are 1 mix- 
ture of cadmium red light and zinc white, 1 mixture 
of Mizarin cadmium and zinc white, ; Venetian red, 
4 KeilK \ ( Iray #s and ^ yellow ochre 1 1j4.Hr on top of 
Reilly's Gra) #4. The list has several unusual, although 
not unique, elements. Two of the colors are mixtures - 
because Albers tonne! that to obtain certain pinks mk\ 
lavenders he could not use paints straight from the 
tube but needed to combine a darker color with zinc 
white. Then there is the overpainting of the tirth color. 
In a studv tor Harboured Albers had used onlv the 






gray in the outermost area; in the course of working 
on the final painting he must have decided he wanted 
to try something else. He frequently changed his mind 
in this way; in many works, especially Homages, 
Albers painted one color on top of another. For all the 
preparation and careful planning, he remained recep- 
tive to change, his eye always dictating his ultimate 
decisions as he proceeded. 

The breakdown of units follows the listing of colors on 
the reverse of the picture. The painting is twenty units 
high, thirty wide; each measures two by two centime- 
ters. There are seventy-five units each of colors " i " and 
"2"; one hundred and fifty units each of the remaining 
three. It is as precise as the contents of a chemist's flask. 

The owner of Harboured, a highly astute graphic 
designer who had studied with both Anni and Josef 
Albers at Black Mountain College, did not know about 
the system for all the years he possessed the painting, 
before we examined its reverse in preparation for this 
exhibition. He always felt its proportionate Tightness 
without understanding the precise origins of that 
quality. Nothing would have pleased Albers more. The 
artist did not want the reading of the method to 
interfere with the pleasure of looking: knowledge 
should not obstruct experience. He did not want to 
make visible the nuances of his technique any more 
than he wished to bare his psyche. Discretion and 
understatement marked the means through which he 
suggested the otherness, the virtually inexplicable sense 
of depth and the unknown, crucial to his art. 

The results of Albers's premeditation are especially 
pungent in Harboured. A beacon of light shines out at 
us. The pink and orange, played against the darker 
brown, gray and gold, radiate luminosity like that of 
the opaque glass constructions, where reflected light 
seems to come from behind. That resonant light is a 
key to the character of Albers's art. Scientific research 
in the 1980s has revealed the positive effects of light on 
the pysche, the perils of the long dark Scandinavian 
winter, the human need for exposure to sunshine and 
for brightness inside the home. Light is a positive, 



uplifting force. It is invigorating, in part because we 
associate it with the sun: the source of earthly growth, 
the parent of our world. And it is central to all of Josef 
Albers's work. He had investigated light in his glass 
constructions, and he continued to use it as an essential 
element in his paintings from then on. 

He craved light in his working situation. He was so 
desperate for it that, rather than subject himself to the 
uncertainties of the natural world (which might have 
forced him, like Bonnard, to forgo painting on dark 
days) he painted -at least from the time of his move to 
New Haven in 1950-inside a studio where he was 
assured of an ideal brightness. He invariably executed 
the Homages to the Square under fluorescent lights. 
The paintings lay flat on simple work tables-four- by 
eight-foot plywood panels on sawhorses. Over one 
table the fluorescent bulbs were arranged warm, cold, 
warm, cold; over the other they were warm, warm, 
cold, cold. He wanted to see each painting under 
different, but always highly luminous, conditions. 
Presumably he did the Variants, as well as his earlier 
work, in a comparably controlled situation. Although 
his paintings do in fact look best in natural daylight, 
Albers would not allow his working method to fall 
victim to its vicissitudes. 

Clear light was imperative to more than Albers's 
process. It is always present in the finished art as well. 
Even when Albers worked exclusively in blacks and 
dark grays -as he did in several Variants and many 
Homages -at least one of the grays is luminous. And 
often the blackest of blacks is radiant as well. To have 
used darker tones entirely without luminosity would 
have produced a negative feeling antithetical to Albers's 
approach. The light physical nature of the forms 
parallels the luminosity of the tones. Heaviness would 
have denoted encumbrance. Murky colors or weighty 
masses would have suggested internal doubt or a 
bowing to external forces. The function of art was to 
provide an alternative to uncertitude or negativism, to 
surmount rather than succumb. 

The luminous character of Albers's paintings 



spiritualizes them. It elevates them from the mundane 
to the celestial plane, ["heir iconic presence also en 
bances theii othei worldl) aspect. In a centurj when 
man) artistic movements and trends in thought have 
stressed .1 probing of the self, Albers's work is geared 
tow. iid transcendence. 

In his Variants and Homages Vlbers investigated the 
saturation of colors, a theme he would also explore in 
Interaction of &lt; olot ["he pink and orange ol Har- 
boured have comparable degrees of saturation, differ- 
ent .is their hues are. I he reason the two colors appeal

the boundaries between [Miik and brown and orange 
and brown are distinct. I hat how n is like some sort 
of serious, mature container for the romantic pair of 
brighter colors. 

In Harboure d Albers also pointedl) demonstrated the 
way that colors change according to their surround- 
ings—another concept he was to pursue in depth in 
Interat Hon. It is hard to believe that the central vertical 
rectangles and the horizontal gra) hand nearer the 
perimeters of the picture are the identical color. Bur 
that is the fact. I he illusion occurs because the gra) 
looks greener w hen it is surrounded b) pink. Not only 
does the hue of the gra) change in relation to its 
neighbors, hut so does its apparent spatial position: it 
seems closet to the picture plane in those vertical 
rectangles than it does m the broadei horizontal 

expanse, where it reads as background.

Anni and fosef Vlbers left IU.uk Mountain t. ollege in 
[949. I he atmosphere of the school had soured, with 
intense feuding within the administration, and the 
Uberses tendered then resignations. After a year in 



New York |osef made the last ot the three major moves 
of his lite: to New I laven, where he took a position as 
head ot the department ot design at Vile University. 

He was sixty-two years old. In the twenty-six years that 
remained to him, lie would achieve more as a painter, 
teacher and writer than ever before. In the \ear ot his 
mo\e to a city laid out in the seventeenth centur) with 
a careful!) gridded square at its core, he began the 
ro the Square on which he would work 
forever after, lor almost a decade his name became 
synonymous with the Yale University School ot Art. 
a\k\ he had an indelible effect on thousands ot students 
there. Whether they went on to become professional 
artists, architects or designers, or entered totally 
unrelated fields, the) give repeated testimony that his 
color and drawing courses And the impact of his 
personality made an unparalleled educational experi- 
ence. Albers gave up full-time teaching in [958-once 
again under some duress— but he remained in the New 
Haven area and retained peripheral affiliations with 
Yale tor the rest ot his life. I he most important ongoing 
link with the universit) was his work with Yale 
Universir\ Press on Interaction of Color. 

It was alter his retirement from teaching that Albers 
could full) devote himself to painting. Me became tar 
more prolific. He designed record covers, fireplaces 
And murals. He also made numerous Homages in 
virtuall) ever) possible print medium. And developed 
and wrote about his Structural Constellations. IK 
published other books and essays. And in time he had 
what was virtuall) a full-time job with the pleasures 
and tribulations of celebrity: the visiting photog- 
raphers Henri (. artier-Bresson, Arnold Newman and 
Snow don among them And interviewers, the corre- 
spondence and a stream ot exhibitions. His modus 
operandi tor almost all of his dealings with the world 
were his own long handwritten letters— ever careful and 
gracious— and a clear-headed .\nd endlessl) accom- 
modating w ite. 

I le continued to paint Variants until 14^, after which 
he onl) took up the theme on a tew rare occasions. But

in the Homages he maintained some of their central 
themes. One was the mutability of color perception. 
Albers sometimes made two Homages with identical 
colors in the central and outermost squares and 
different colors in the interval between them. The 
intervening colors make the identical colors look 
totally different from one another. If we compare Early 
&lt; )de, 1962, with Arrival, [963 (cat. nos. 221, 222), we 
would scarcely surmise that the central and outermost 
squares of the two paintings are precisely the same 
color, but Albers's notations prove that they are. In the 
Homages, as in the Variants, Albers always listed all 
his colors, with their manufacturers' names, on the 
reverse of each panel (see fig. 12). In both Early Ode 
and Arrival, the middle square is a Cadmium Yellow 
Pale manufactured by Blockex, the largest square a 
Chapin Neutral I from Shiva. Since the two works 
were done within a year of each other, we assume that 



the paints were from the same batches, perhaps even 
the same tubes. 

Despite the similarity of color, the paintings produce 
very different effects. Early Ode gains its haunting 
presence from the mysterious, luminous yellow that 
seems the perfect middle tone between the cadmium 
and the gray. In a certain light, that yellow almost 
disappears into the gray. Arrival has more of a look of 
victory to it, thanks largely to the two bold and weighty 
colors that separate the same cadmium and gray. You 
can have the same starting and end points, but if you 
alter the internal course, everything changes with it. In 
Arrival the colors appear to move in and out, in 
accordion fashion. In Early Ode, however, the second 
square out from the middle of the picture appears to 
be a tissue, which seems alternately to lie over and 
under the central square. In truth, each color has been 
painted directly on the white ground, in accordance 
with Albers's self-imposed rule that he must never put 
one square on top of another. (He did, however, 
sometimes repaint single squares.) Yet it looks as if a 
thin film, held taut in space, keeps shifting from a 
position in front of the cadmium yellow pale to a place 
behind it. Morever forms seem at one moment to be 
translucent, at another opaque, a play of the type that 
Albers first explored in the glass construction Steps, 
1 93 t (cat. no. 96). Albers must have looked far 
and wide and done countless blotting paper studies 
(see cat. nos. 192, 194-199) to find the Schewingen 
Yellow Light, made by Old Holland, that would 
achieve this perpetual motion and transformation. 

Nowhere is the effect of a single color on its neighbor- 
ing ones more astounding than in the diptych Despite 
Mist, 1967 (cat. no. 245). In this pair of paintings, 
which Albers hinged together (giving them their altar- 
piece-like quality as well as coupling them perma- 
nently), all the elements except for the outermost 
squares are identical. There are no variations what- 
soever in size, format or the middle and second colors, 
although under most light conditions this seems 
unbelievable. Not only do the tones in the interior of 
the composition look entirely different in the two 



t" 



paintings, but tin.- movement, shapes the degree to 
which the corners appear rounded and internal prop 
unions of the squares also seem to change. That 
someone could take paints called "Optic Gra 
Warm" and "Optic Gra) #\ tool," both made bj 
Marabu, and so thoroughl) alter their appearance h\ 
placing them next to either c hapin Neutral #i by 
Shiva on the left mk\ Reilly's Gra) #8 In Grum- 
bacher on rlu- right is testimony not only to diligence 
and craft, but also to imagination and faith. 

Sometimes two Homages vary onl) in the order in 
which sequences of identical colors have been painted. 
In Tenacious, 1969, and Warm Silence, 1971 cat. nos. 
lis, lie-. 1 , which hang .is .1 pair in a private New York 
collection, the same tour yellows are painted in pre- 
cise!) reverse order. 1 Ins reversal yields more than the 
simple transformation one might anticipate, which is 
that the antral square seems to be closest to the \ lewer 
in one painting and furthest awa\ in the other. Not 
onl) does this directional difference occur, but, addi- 
tionally, identical paints appear to he very different 
colors solely because their position has changed. The 
c admium Yellow Pale b) Rembrandt in the center of 
Tenacious scarcel) resembles the same paint in the 
outermost square of Warm Silence. Similarly, the 
Naples Yellow b) Blockex that tonus the border in 
Tenacious looks different in the middle of Warm 
Silence. Moreover, the si/es of the squares in Tenacious 
and Warm Silence, although the same, appear at odds. 
And the paintings have two ver) different emotional 
climates, the essential characters of w huh are coin e\ed 
In their titles, w huh Albersgave to his works after they 
were completed. 



In an essa\ on halo ( alvino, Gore Vidal quotes from 
.m Italian television interview that took place shortly 
before the novelist's death. Cab mo claimed that, 
"Onl) a certain prosaic solidity can give birth to 
cream it\ ; fantas) is like jam; you have to spread it on 
a solid piece of bread. It not, it remains a shapeless 
thing, like jam, out of which you can't make any- 



thin " Albers's precise manipulation of paints on 
those unyielding Masonite panels was his "prosaic 
solidity." It gave birth not onl) to fantasy, but also to 
considerable spirituality ,\\w\ philosophical complexity. 

I list ot all color behavior can be compared to human 
behavior. People, like colors, have one appearance 
when the) are alone, another when the) are with a 
group of family members whom the) resemble phvsi- 
call) and psychologically, mk\ yet another when the) 
are surrounded In strangers. Their relatives often 
mitigate their distinctiveness, while foreign \ isitors ^.\n 
intensify the dominance ot certain characteristics In 
contrast. Even it people themselves do not change, our 
view ot them, just like our perception ot colors, varies 
according to their surroundings. 

Additional!) the work suggests, with powerful effect, 
the compatibility of contradictions. The Variants, 
emphatically horizontal in both their overall dimen- 
sions and in the narrow, rectangular bands that sweep 
across their broad surfaces, are given .\n upward lift In 
the two central vertical rectangles that resemble twin 
doors. That lilr. In putting a springy bounce into a 
gentle sweep, intellects cheer into sobriety. Pensive 
forms— they suggest furrowed eyebrows and a creased 
brow -are full ot laughter. Viewing the Variants and 
the Homages as well, we experience a sense ot over- 
whelming calm, a repose that is especially effective 
because it is very light-hearted. High spirits coexist 
with solemnity. What is phlegmatic is also fiery; what 
is somber, playful. 

In both the Variants and the Homages, not onl) 
opposite moods but also irreconcilable motions 
coexist. We teel stretched across that picture plane, our 
arms pulled taut; at the same time we are pulled 
upward. We are looking at a two-dimensional object, 
its single flat plane careful!) subdh ided m^\ decorated, 
vet suddenl) we hud ourselves pursuing a complicated 
course through a proscenium stage. We move inward 
and outward at the same time, then simultaneously left 
.\n&gt;.\ right. With color too there is a confluence ot 
opposites. Albeis might juxtapose a midnight black 
with the blue ot a noonclav skv, a cold, disfincth

manmade steely gray with a verdant green and a sunny 
yellow. Art was to accomplish what nature could not. 

Irreconcilable elements are also joined in a body of 
work of 1949 to 1976 which Albers called his Struc- 
tural Constellations or Linear Constructions (see cat. 
nos. 171-176). These are discussed by Neal Benezra 
and Charles Rickart in their essays in this catalogue. "' 
This series is to the Graphic Tectonics and some of the 
other earlier geometric prints and drawings as the 
Homages to the Square are to the paintings that 
precede them: a further development, in the most 
reductive form possible, of ideas with which the artist 
had long been grappling. As Albers said in an interview 
with the English critic Paul Overy, "Though my 
paintings and linear constructions are not connected, 
they stem from the same attitude, the same urge to 
achieve from a minimum of effort a quantitum of 
effect. While I was still teaching in Europe, I used to 
say to my students, 'Do less in order to do more.'" 
In the Structural Constellations he pursued linear 
geometry in a more refined format than ever before. He 
devised a system based on minimal variables and 



subsequently worked on it diligently for over two 
decades. It took form first in rough working sketches, 
and then in large drawings, embossed prints (white on 
white, white on black, white on gray), white-line 
engravings on black Vinylite, prints made from en- 
graved brass and large architectural commissions. The 
subject is always ambivalent forms, which simultane- 
ously appear to be flat and three-dimensional and are 
penetrated in a variety of incompatible ways. 

In offering multiple approaches to the picture space, 
these Structural Constellations descend directly from 
Cubism. Like Picasso's 1912 drawing Guitar (fig. 13), 
they use simple, well-drawn, unmodulated lines to 
make planes that shift perpetually and forms that 
appear to unfold first one way and then another. The 
discrepancies seem both like magic and like accurate 
reflections of the variables in the human grasp of 
reality, psychological and physical. Both Picasso and 
Albers questioned the nature of all perception. They 
discarded old notions of truth and standard ideas about 
vision. And both artists took a formal approach to 
their themes, developing a sequence of internal

less. I lere fibers seems to have started out earthbound 
and then moved heavenward; having Him given us 
implicid) weight) three-dimensional bodies, he makes 
them float. I he transformation through u hich masses 
are rendered weightless, and the interjection ol move- 
ment into statu objects, were among Albers's constant 
preoccupations. In the sandblasted glass works he had 
countered the heav) mass ol the materials with the 
effects of light. In the Variants mw\ the Homages he 
began b) methodicall) appl) ing paint grounded to the 
panel, but subsequent!) made the forms buoyant and 
the colors ethereal. I Ins negation ol weight and mass 
both establishes and denies such physical properties, 
the son .it contradiction essential to Albers's achieve 
ment ol poetr) through the application ol overtl) 
Scientific means. 

I he Homages have their feet on the earth and then- 
heads in the cosmos thanks to their 1:2:3 formats. I he 
central, or first, square is like a seed: the heart of the 
matter, the core trom which ever) thing emanates. 1 he 
intervals underneath that first square, created b) either 
two or three larger OUtl) ing squares, are doubled to the 
lett and right ol it and tripled above it. In the foul 
Square format, for example, which is ten units wide 
and high, the middle square is tour units w ide. each ot 
the outer squares is halt a unit wide underneath the 
middle square, one unit w ide at lett and right and one 
and a halt units high above. In The Poweroj the ( enter, 
Kudolt Arnhenn explores the w a) S this ratio shifts the 
normal balance ot earthl) horizontal and heavenl) 

vertical elements ot a single square in favor «&gt;t the 
heavenly. " 1 his as) mmetr) produces the d\ namics 1 &gt;t 
the theme, a squeezing below, an expansion above. It 
promotes a depth effect, w huh would be counteracted 
it all the squares were grouped s\ mmetnealb around 
the same center." I he as) mmetr) is subtle— the squares 
are almost centered— so consequent!) the upward 
thrust is gradual rather than pronounced. I bus the 



spiritual element is achieved with a soft voice rather 
than a loud shout. I ike all true spirituality, Albers's is 
achieved in poignant, muted tones, rather than with 
evangelical ardor. 

In analyzing the ascendant qualit) ot the Homages, 

Arnhenn points out that it we follow the tour diagonals 
created b) the corners ot the squares within squares, 
they converge on a point precise!) one quarter ot the 
wa) up the painting. I"he diagonals created b) drawing 

lines through onl) the two bottom sets ot corners .mc\ 
carrying those lines all the wa) across the panel make 
an \ that demarcates the rectangle that is the lower 
halt ot the composition. "'A solid base is thereb) 
provided on which the sequence ot squares can rise 
with confidence trom step to step-not so different 
trom the coffin in hero's Resurrection, trom which the 
movement toward heaven takes off." 1 ' Ibis strong 
foundation is similar to the waxes in a seascape b) 
c ourbet; its submission to gravity emphasizes the 
weightlessness above. 

1 ike the image ot a cathedral on the original Bauhaus 
bn 'June which beckoned Albers to Weimar, his Horn- 
ages to the Square have massive, sanctuary-like bodies 
and the attributes ol steeples. In buildings mk\ paint- 
ings alike, there is a mix 1 &gt;t solid craft with philosophi- 
cal concerns. I hat blend ot factualit) and spiritualit) 
parallels the issues ot mortalit) and immortality that 
loomed large tor Albers m his later years. Determinedly

grays and beiges . In isisO, when he and Anm moved

office. But the matter-of-fact Albers knew well that 
through his achievement he was guaranteed a degree 
of immortality. Returning to Catholicism in his late 
years, he may well have believed that not only his art 
but also his soul would outlive his body. He lived as 
austerely as a monk; and like a monk he thought often 
of the afterlife. The words of George Eliot- "It is 
strange how deeply colours seem to penetrate one, like 
scent.. ..They look like fragments of heaven" ?4 -might 
describe his state of mind. 

The world beyond our individual earthly existence was 
in Albers's thoughts when he made a blue green 
Homage in 1976 (cat. no. 246), some two months 
before his eighty-eighth birthday and his death a week 
later. By the time he made this Homage he was working 
on very few paintings-his hand was too unsteady, so 
he focused more on printmaking-but he did this panel 
as a study for an Aubusson tapestry that had been 
commissioned for a bank in Sydney, Australia. 

I discussed the painting with Albers on several occa- 
sions. He told me that he had one problem with it. He 
had found a combination of his chosen colors that 
interacted perfectly in an Homage format when the 
central square was four (out of ten) units wide, but that 
did not work as well in the format with a larger (six- 
unit wide) central square. Showing me studies of halves 
of these paintings (he often worked in half Homages, 
especially when designing prints or tapestries), he 
explained that, in the version with the larger middle, 
"downstairs" was fine, but not "upstairs." He wanted 
both a spatial flow and a color "intersection." Albers 
described this intersection in Interaction of Color. It is 
the process by which a correctly selected color lying 
between two other colors takes on the appearance of 
both of those colors. When colors properly intersect in 
a three-square Homage, the color of the innermost 
square will appear toward the outer boundary of the 
second square out. The color of the outermost square 
will also appear within the second square, toward its 
inner boundary. "The middle color plays the role of 
both mixture parents, presenting them in reversed 
placement."" ' This is entirely illusory. The second 



square is not in fact a mixture, but is paint straight 
from the tube, applied flatly. It is just that at a distance 
our perception tells us that it is modulated, and that 
some of the first and third colors are visible within it. 

Albers then pointed to the version with the small 
central square. Here the intersection occurred, but he 
was not satisfied. Moving his hand over the sky blue 
center, and then over the more terrestrial forest green 
and the sea-like aqua surrounding it, he explained that 
these colors were the earth and the cosmos, the cosmos 
being in the center. In the version with the smaller 
middle, the cosmos was too distant. 

While the earlier Homages generally depend on sharp 
light-dark contrasts, the later ones are more subtle, 
with closely related hues. Here Albers's development 
parallels that of Cezanne and Monet, who in their late 
work also moved toward hazy, atmospheric effects. In 
the version of this last blue green painting with the 
larger middle, Albers wanted all boundaries and edges 
virtually to disappear. Additionally, there should be no 
sharp corners on the inner square. (He said that 
Cartier-Bresson once told him that he made "circular 
squares," which delighted him.) To achieve these effects 
he needed to find colors with the identical light 
intensity. The cosmos should have neither sharp boun- 
daries nor corners. 

He said that even the supreme colorist Turner had never 
been able to match light intensities exactly. Yet by 
making studies with painted blotting paper, Albers 
found precisely the paint he needed for the middle 
square. With Winsor Newton Cobalt Green, code 
number 192, he could obtain both his desired inter- 
section and the match of light intensities. At that 
moment, however, the only Winsor Newton Cobalt 
Green available was from a newer batch, code number 
205. He admired the paint company for changing the 
code number to indicate a change in the pigment, but 
was frustrated not to be able to duplicate a paint that 
had been discontinued several years earlier. After some 
searching, however, he found a supplier with some old 
tubes of 192, and he made the painting. The inter- 
section he achieved is like magic. Looking at that 



4 ) 



Homage with me, Albers demonstrated it by interlock- 
ing .ill oi Ins fingers, and praised the abilit) of the outer 
and inner squares to span the middle color. Again he 
spok( of the need of "the universe" here rather than 
"the cosmos" to be immaterial and without bound- 
aries. I his was liis List painting.

Russian and Albers used the motif to very different 
purposes. For Malevich the square was a full stop, a 
reductionism; for Albers it was a tool, a device to serve 
the revelation of color, a stepping stone to vast riches. 

In fact, the Homages descend more from Renaissance 
precedents than from revolutionary twentieth-century 
movements which attempted to sever ties with the 
artistic past. The calm and balance of Albers's harmoni- 
ous arrangements, and their combination of elegant 
frontality and spatial progression, gives them some of 
the feeling of fifteenth-century Madonnas. Their tradi- 
tional base separates them not only from more modern 
idioms such as Suprematism but also from the 
Minimalism of the 1960s and from contemporary 
hard-edge abstraction with which it is often linked. So 
too does its use of spare geometric form as a device 
more than an end product. Today it is a cliche of 
museum installation to hang Homages to the Square 
in the same room as paintings from the 1960s by Frank 
Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Kenneth Noland and other 
hard-edge artists. For a number of reasons Albers's art 
looks out of place in juxtaposition to theirs. Paul Overy 
commented that it was "ironic" that Albers was shown 
with Minimalists in an American festival in London in 
1986: 

Albers lived in America for nearly half of his long 
life and taught a whole generation of American 
painters. Yet his work remained strongly European 
m its "relational" qualities and, even though he 
used a "centered image", the way he placed the 
bottom edges of the squares closer together 
created effects quite different from the symmetri- 
cal 1960s work of Stella and Judd. Albers applied 
his paint with a palette knife and deliberately left 
the edges rough, with a tooth for the interacting 
colours to bite on one another. He never used 
masking tape and his works are not hard edged 
(except in reproduction). The largest paintings are 
about three and a half feet square; small by 
American standards. The values they affirm are 
not American values but European. 37 



The Homages do not belong to any one movement but 
are an individual and unusual expression of a familiar 
human drive. Gombrich sees them as unique embodi- 
ments of the "economy of means that is one of the 
driving forces of art works" throughout history. He 
feels that some of Albers's objectives only came to the 
fore in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
when the Beuronschule began to emphasize monumen- 
tality and proportion and Hodler became interested in 
parallelism and formal organization. However, he 
maintains that the driving force behind the Homages 
to the Square and Albers's other series is timeless and 
universal. These works derive from "the interest in 
producing constraints and then overpowering them. 
You have to concentrate and see just how much you 
can make of an element or elements." This is a tradi- 
tion that exists in both music and the decorative arts, 
and has "parallels in poetry also." Gombrich compares 
Albers to a Mogul Emperor who spent his whole life 
making variations on two lines. Both were devoted to 
"this problem of how much to get out of simple 
elements; the making of permutations of every kind, 
in order to prove them inexhaustible." 

Albers was fond of saying that he descended from 
Adam, and in some ways the Homages go all the way 
back to the cave paintings at Lascaux. There too we 
find only three colors: yellow, red and black. In the 
Homages, of course, Albers reduced his palette by 
choice rather than necessity, selecting his three or four 
hues from a reserve of thousands. Happier with some 
of the limitations of the early cave-dweller, he was not 
unlike those of us who head for mountain tops- where 
only the contents of our knapsack, rather than the 
abundance of supermarkets, are available. 

The generalized Homages are "everyman," and Albers 
was everyman, reduced to essentials like the ancient 
cave-artist with his oil lamp, facing the gritty reality of 
a coarse surface. In the cases at Lascaux as on the 
rough side of the Masonite panels on which Albers 
worked, the variegated surface gives the colors richness 
and variation, and lends a crucial irregularity to both 
the textures and the edges of forms. In that irregularity,

and in tin.' sturd) application of paint on top of it, is 
rhc kernel of the humanit) of the work. It gives both 
the paintings at Lascaux and the Homages to the 
Square an intensity thai suggests that the artist's life 
depended on his abilit) to make imams. Albers, like 
the cavemen, grasped at visual experience .is .1 source 
of the truth underlying human existence. Pan or the 
power ot his vision is th.it it is clearly the product ot 
the most pressing and urgent necessity. 



I he Homages descend more directly from Cezanne's 
example than from any other: b\ Albers's own admis- 
sion C ezanne \\ as the kej figure in his development. In 
works like /. ( bateau \ . 16 Cezanne in 

essence presented three planes of color, all parallel to 
the picture plane, and he used the properties ot color 
to hold each plane in space. Hut in spite of these links 
C e/anne's and Alhers's ^n.\U were not the same. I he 
Frenchman sought to capture the natural world— and 
so m his painting the green clearl) signifies the I 
ground, mk\ the tan helps place the chateau— firmly in 



the middleground, while Alhers's colors occupy 
abstract, nonrepresentational form so as to create an 
other-worldly realm in which planes constantly shirt 
position. But each artist de\ ised a space that is foreshort- 
ened and compressed vet suggests depth, and each 
employed planes that are both frontal and recessive. In 
/ . 1 bateau Noir, the sk\ does a suprisingly AJbersian 
thing: it moves up and back and in and out— the way 
the sk\, which is everywhere, reall) does. Cezanne's 
focus on the technique ot painting, like Alhers's, \ ields 
the unfathomable mysteries that nature ultimate!) 
offers. Moreover, (. e/anne's rough surfaces, along with 
Alhers's well-worked painted planes, receive light; like 
the artists themselves, they do nor hold forth so much 
as respond. 

The poet Rainer Maria Rilke w rote of ( e/anne's work, 
"As it these colors could heal one of indecision once 
and for all. I he good conscience of these reds, these 
blues, their simple truthfulness, it educates you; and it 
you stand beneath them as acceptingly as possible, it's 
as if the) were doing something tor you." 1 Rilke 
visited the [9 _ ( ezanne exhibition in Paris time and 



47 



again-with a vehemence comparable to the ardor that 
Albers felt when he returned daily to his square panels 
and tubes of paint-and observed: 

You also notice, a little more clearly each time, 
how necessary it was to go beyond love, too; it's 
natural, after all, to love each of these things as 
one makes it: but if one shows this, one makes it 
less ivell; one judges it instead of saying it. . . . This 
labor which no longer knew any preferences or 
biases or fastidious predilections, whose minutest 
component has been tested on the scales of an 
infinitely responsive conscience, and which so 
incorruptibly reduced a reality to its color content 
that it resumed a new existence in a beyond of 
color, without any previous memories.* 9 

Rilke's intensity and Cezanne's visual connoisseurship 
and the resultant distillations are in ways comparable 
to Albers's own. Indeed the colors of the Homages do 
have a "simple truthfulness," and do "educate you." 
Their confidence and decisiveness penetrate us. Here is 
the art of someone who overcame normal human 
ambivalence, who followed the advice he frequently 
gave to his students-"Don't jump on bandwagons. Sit 
on your own behinds"-and found both his own 
methods and course. 

Here, too, is an art devoid of memories. Describing 
timeless phenomena, it transcends individualism. It 
reveals color rather than opinions about color. The 
Homages become, in a generalized way, living beings. 
As such, like much great late work, they grapple with 
ultimate, essential truths. Grounded solidly in their 
craft, they touch upon sublime mysteries. Stripped 
bare, they caused minimal disruption between the 
communicator and the means of communication. They 
conquered the gap between speaker and statement, 
between writer and words, between painter and 
medium: Josef Albers and the Homages were one. 



NOTES 

This catalogue is dedicated to Anni Albers. Her public person is 
well known; she is a pioneering abstract textile artist, designer and 
printmaker, and an innovative writer on aesthetics. For fifty years 
she was visible as an intensely devoted, though never docile, spouse, 
a position she has retained with the much detested term "widow." 
But the role in which I have been lucky enough to know her is less 
familiar: that of a true and giving friend. 

Most of those who helped put together this exhibition and book 
are acknowledged in the preface. I must, however, single out a few 
from my point of view. The staff of the Guggenheim Museum has 
shown just how hospitable a great institution can be. Thomas M. 
Messer and Diane Waldman have been unusually gracious and 
supportive. Susan B. Hirschfeld has not only been highly efficient 
and, when it was required, supremely diplomatic, but also consist- 
ently delightful. Thomas Padon has handled an encyclopedia's worth 
of details with grace and skill. Carol Fuerstein has been perpetually 
clear-headed and flexible at the same time. Mimi Poser and her 
staff have mixed work and laughter with rare effectiveness. At the 
Albers Foundation Kelly Feeney has not only been the most diligent 
and patient of aides-de-camp, but also unfailingly imaginative and 
good humored. And at home my wife Katharine has been, as always, 
supportive, witty and insightful, and our daughters Lucy and 
Charlotte full of spirited encouragement. 

My deep personal thanks also go to Lee Eastman, a patron in the 
truest sense, and to his ever gracious wife Monique. For exceptional 
support and insight I also thank Maximilian Schell, Jochen and 
Martina Moormann, Paul and Ellen Hirschland, Charles Kingsley, 
Herbert Agoos, Saul and Caroline Weber, Ulrich Schumacher, Denise 
Rene and Ruth Villalovas; for their remarkable skills and diligence 
in conservation work Patricia S. Garland, Martina Yamin and Ray 
Errett; and for countless forms of assistance Hans Farman, Phyllis 
Fitzgerald, Carroll Janis, Emma Lewis, Diana Murphy and Tim 
Nighswander.

only one known drawing earlier than Farm Woman, a charm- 
ing but far less sophisticated work that Albers did when he 
was teaching in Stadtlohn.

Josef Albers: Art Education at 
Black Mountain College 

MARY EMMA HARRIS 



In Berlin in the spring and summer of 193 3 , the Nazis 
forced the closing of the Bauhaus, the innovative 
school of architecture and design founded by Walter 
Gropius in 1919. Simultaneously Black Mountain 
College was founded near Asheville, North Carolina, 
by John Andrew Rice and a group of dissident faculty 
members at Rollins College who had been fired or 
had resigned in a dispute over academic freedom. 
This coincidence was ultimately to benefit Black 
Mountain because Josef Albers, a former Bauhaus 
teacher, who had received an intimidating letter from 
the city of Dessau, would come to work at the 
American school. 

Critical to the educational philosophy of the found- 
ers of the new college was the idea that the arts 
should be at the center of the curriculum rather than 
what Albers later described as "their decorative 
sideplace." ' They realized, however, that if they were 
to achieve their goals, the conventional teacher of 
painting and sculpture would not be sufficient. In 
their search for a new kind of teacher they were led 
to The Museum of Modern Art, where Philip 
Johnson recommended Albers, to the new college. 
Despite his warning that he could not speak English, 
Albers was invited to join the Black Mountain 
faculty. Idealistic, moralistic, dogmatic, brilliant, 
disciplined and stubborn, he remained for sixteen 
years, and his personality, teaching and ideas exerted 
a profound impact on all areas of college life. 

One summer session art teacher commented that 



every experimental college should have a German 
schoolmaster such as Albers because he encouraged 
a sense of order without dominating the school. Of 
moderate height and slim with a fair complexion and 
graying blond hair, Albers's physical presence was 
modest. He was most often seen in light-colored 
slacks and a shirt or in overalls or coveralls, the attire 
of a craftsperson or worker. He and his wife Anni, 
the distinguished weaver and writer, shared a rustic 
cottage of wood and stone with Theodore and 
Barbara Dreier and their children at the Lake Eden 
campus. The common room was furnished sparsely 
with Breuer tubular steel chairs, chairs of wood and 
leather which Albers designed, using a traditional 
Mexican chair as a model, and Constructivist 
furniture by Mary (Molly) Gregory, who taught 
woodworking. There were mats of natural materials 
and freshly cut flowers. Albers's studio, which was 
in the cottage, was off limits to students and faculty 
unless they were invited. The Black Mountain years 
were some of his most productive as an artist, and 
the demands of community life were such that he 
did not allow interruptions in those precious hours 
available for his own painting and printmaking. 
Nevertheless, aspiring art students had a chance to 
observe him pursuing the professional activities of 
an artist, such as dealing with galleries and exhibi- 
tions, and to learn from his example the dedication 
and concentration necessary for creative work. 
Albers was a member of the Board of Fellows, the 
central governing body of the college, as well as the 



jo 



committees thai took care ol the practical problems 
of dail) living. In addition, he organized the special 
summer an sessions. 

I hough separated bj thousands ol miles and differ- 
ent cultures, both the Bauhaus and Black Mountain 
shared a progressive, experimental, adventurous 
spirit. Vmerican technology and architecture and the 
writing ol educators such as John Dewe) had been 
a liberating fora foi the Bauhaus leaders. Yet when 
Albers arrived in America, he found .1 young country 
hampered in its struggle to establish its ov» n identit) 
In .1 confusing idealization of older, more established 
cultures, especiall) those of the Italian Renaissance 
and c lassical Greece, and bj a romantic view of the 
.u ts. Id the progressive spun of the founders, he 
brought the spun of modernism, which he defined 
as .in attitude tow ard the present time, .1 "significant 
contemporaneousness." In an essaj entitled " [ruth- 
fulness in An," Albers insisted tli.it the art of am 
period is valid only to the extent that it reveals the 
spirit of the time through form: "truthfulness ro art 
as spiritual creation." Objecting to a position tow ard 
the past that moves tradition "from a role of 
facilitation to one of inhibition," he directed the 
attention of his students t,. contemporar) architec- 
ture, to bridges, ro photography, to commercial 
typography and advertising, to abstract art and to 
earl) American crafts. He spent both of his sabbat- 
icals and several summers m Mexico, Central 
America and the Southwest, and the Pre-Columbian 
art of these areas had a profound impact on his art 
and his teaching. In fact he discouraged the obliga- 
tor) European stud) period and encouraged his 
students instead to travel to Mexico. 

I he role of the arts in a culture and in education 
was a theme that was reinterpreted throughout the 
college's history. Albers recalled that when asked on 
his arn\al at Black Mountain what he hoped to 

accomplish, he "uttered better stuttered to 

Open eyes. 1 " Although he later noted that b) this 
he meant "to open the student's eyes to the 



phenomena about him," or to allow him to see, 
clearl) tor Albers "seeing" encompassed the broader 
concept ot "\ ision." i le \\ rote of his goal, "We w ant 

a student who sees art as neither a beaut) shop nor 
imitation of nature, as more than embellishment and 
entertainment; but as a spiritual documentation of 
lite; and who sees that real art is essential life .\nc\ 
essential lite is art." lie objected to the neglect ot 
the manuall) oriented student in education, to the 
acquisition of knowledge as .\n end in itself, and to 
the emphasis on classification and s\ stems, insisting 
that lite is process and change and tar more complex 
than an) system. Because action is inherent m the 
creation of art forms, he felt that through the practice 
of the arts the student would develop independent 
thinking, productiveness and a creative, inventive 
approach to problem solving. "We are content," 
Albers wrote, "it our srudies ot form achieve an 
understanding, vision, clear conceptions, and a 
pn iductive V, ill." 1 le referred to the fascist masses m 
I urope as "an uncreative crew" and made a distinc- 
tion between the person who by his example gives 
direction to the lives of others and the leader who 

needs followers. I urthermore, he wrote, " in is a 

province in which one finds all the problems of lite 
reflected — not onl) the problems of form 
proportion and balance but also spiritual problems 
e.g. ot philosophy, of religion, of sociology, ot 
econom) ." 

( ritual to Albers's teaching was his perception ot 
the artist as form-giver and ot art as a "documenta- 
tion of human mentality through form." In a ke) 
statement which he began formulating soon after his 
arrival at the college and which appears in the notes 
of students, Albers summarized his ideas about the 
relationship between form and cultural values: 

ivable thing has /on;;. 
&gt;&gt;i can he cither appearance &lt;&gt;&gt;■ behavior. 
Hut since appearance is .; result of behavior, 
and behavior produces appearand 
every form has meaning. 



&lt;' 



The shortest formulation of this is: 
Every thing has form, 
every form has meaning. 

To understand the meaning of form, 
that is conscious seeing of and feeling for form, 
is the indispensable preliminary condition for 
culture. 

Culture is ability to select or to distinguish 

the better, that is the more meaningful form, 
the better appearance, the better behavior. 

Therefore culture is a concern with quality. 

Culture can be manifested in two ways: 
Through recognition of better form 
and through producing of better form. 

The latter direction is the way of art. 

Art as the acting part of culture 

is therefore its proof and measurement. 

The content of Albers's courses in drawing, design 
and color was "the knowledge and application of 
the fundamental laws of form"; the goal, "a sensitive 
reading of form." Albers observed that though 
"imagination and vision," both of which are essential 
to the creative process, can only be a byproduct of 
study, "discovery and invention" and "observation 
and comparison" which "aim at open eyes and 
flexible minds" can be taught. "The layman or 
spectator," he proposed, "as well as the practicing 
artist — does see, recognize, compare, judge form in 
its psychic effect. To produce form with psychic effect, 
that is form with emotional content, makes an 
artist." He argued that the general student would 
benefit more from a course in the study of the 
elements of form than one in sculpture or painting 
because "a color correctly seen and understood [is] 
more important than a mediocre still-life." 4 

At Black Mountain Albers adapted the curriculum 
of the Bauhaus, a professional art school, to general 
education. His courses offered an alternative to the 
predominant methods of art education: the Beaux- 
Arts practice of copying the art of the past, the use 



of scientific formulas, and the untutored self- 
expression encouraged by progressive educators. The 
core of the visual arts curriculum, designed for both 
the general student and the beginning art student, 
was the courses in drawing, design ( Werklehre), color 
and painting which were supplemented by projects 
in the workshops. Ideally the college would have 
offered courses in painting, printmaking, sculpture 
and other areas of the visual arts for the advanced 
student, and the workshops would have been well- 
equipped and directed by master craftspersons. The 
size and limited financial means of the college, 
however, did not allow for so large an art faculty and 
such elaborate facilities. 

The basic course that was taken by most members 
of the community, including faculty, was drawing. 
Its goal was "a disciplined education of the eye and 
hand"; its content, exact observation and pure 
representation. Beginning students were challenged 
to draw from memory the motif from their cigarette 
pack, a favorite candy bar or a soft drink to make 
them aware of how poorly trained visual memory is. 
To develop an ability for visualization — "thinking 
before speaking" — the student looked at a flat sheet 
of paper or a leaf and drew it as if it were folded on 
an imaginary axis. Exercises in mirror writing and 
in disposing — drawing an image like the meander 
again and again in the same or different sizes — 
developed motor control and visualization. In one 
exercise the students drew in the air, and in another 
they drew "blindfolded," looking only at the model. 
Quick line drawings were made to capture the 
essence of forms. Techniques such as crosshatching 
and shading and consideration of decorative ele- 
ments were left for advanced studies after the college. 
Early in his American experience, Albers came into 
conflict with local mores when some of the women 
at the college became concerned about possible 
reaction in the local community to the use of nude 
models. Though he declared that it was "all non- 
sense.. . [and] he wasn't going to let a lot of old 
women in the outside community who were nothing 



J2 



but .1 bunch oi crudes run the C ollege," he acceded 
and models wore shorts and halters or bathing suits. 

Albers defined basic design .is "practicing planning," 
not "habit, dreaming, &lt;&gt;r accident .is nails dropped 
from a carpenter's pocket .is he walks on .1 road ." 
Students explored principles of design such .is 
proportion, described In Albers .is the relationship 
nt p.irrs to one another and the whole, symmetrical 
and asymmetrical design, geometric and arithmetic 
progression, the Golden Mean and the Pythagorean 
theorem. Spatial studies in illusion, density, intensity, 
si/e and foreshortening were investigated using 
matches pasted flat on surfaces and straight puis 
applied vertically or diagonally to supports. Stream- 
lining in natural and manmade forms was discussed 
in terms of the movement of .1 fish through fluids, .1 
drop of water through air and .1 knife through solids. 
( entral to .ill of Albers's courses were the principles 
iestalt theory in which the image is read as a 
whole and tor meaning. I le \\ as especiall) influenced 
In Indian designs m which the figure and what is 
usually treated as background are of equal impor- 
tance, And he challenged doubtful students to 
determine whether the zebra is a black animal with 
white stripes or white with black stripes. 

Albers initiall) called the design course Werklehre— 
learning through doing— to distinguish it from the 
usual course which deals primaril) with designs on 
paper rather than with materials. Studies of mate- 
rials— both in combination (the surface appearance 
of materials and construction the capacit) of 
materials —were made in direct contact with mate- 
rial, not from a textbook or at the drawing board. 
Paper was folded and scored to give it tensile 
properties. Other materials were examined for the 
structural qualities that developed as the) grew, tor 
surface qualities created In treating with tools, and, 
ot greatest importance, the total surface appearance 
which Albers called matiere— "how a substance 
looks." The constant themes were relativit) and 
interaction: "Matiere influences nearln matiere, as 
color influences color." Students were encouraged 



to do things to materials to give them qualities the) 
do not normall) have in order to extend the pos- 
sibilities of their use: "Nothing can be one thing but 
a hundred things." Students learned that "visuall) a 
pebble is as valuable as a diamond" And that both 
the Breuer tubular steel chair and the lo^allv crafted 
slat-back chair represent good design and "a think- 
ing out of materials." Materials were examined for 
their tactile as well as their optical qualities. B) 
juxtaposition and changes in quantit) the students 
made cold materials look warm, soft materials look 
hard, and one material imitate another 111 appear- 
ance. I he "swindel" or visual illusion was not 
trickery tor its own sake but An effort to educate the 
eve "to the discrepanc) between the physical fact 
and the psychic effect" and to learn new wavs of 
seeing And using materials." 

Students' color notes begin with the statement, 
"COLOR IS TH I MOST R EL ATI VI MEDIUM 

IN \ R I . " The themes ot interaction and relativ itv 
and the subjective nature of one's reading were 
central to the color studies, as they were in the design 
course. Although he taught the color theories ot 
Goethe, Weber-Fechner, Ostwald and others, Albers 
realized that the visual process, encompassing both 
the physical And psychic aspects ot seeing as well as 
the interplay of other senses such as smell and 
hearing, is tar too complex to be explained In a single 
theory. Rather than formulating a new color theory, 
he provided the tools tor a better understanding ot 
the nature ot visual perception. In one exercise a 
single color was placed on different backgrounds to 
make it appear to be two different colors, And in 
another different colors were placed on different 
backgrounds to make them appear the same. C olor 
was studied in terms of quantity, tone, placement, 
intensity, contrast, shape And repetition. In studies in 
transparency using opaque paper, the intermediate 
color created by the overlapping of two other colors 
was sought. In all color studies colored papers were 
used rather than paints, as it is too e.isv to mix 
pigment to achieve a certain effect and too difficult 






to re-create the same color if it is needed. The 
abundant colorful leaves of the Blue Ridge were also 
employed in both the color and design classes. 
Albers's students often were captivated by the 
exercises; however, he admonished them that "As 
knowledge of acoustics does not produce musicality, 
so knowledge of color theory does not produce art." 

Painting, which was taught as an advanced color 
course, primarily involved the use of watercolor. Of 
this course Albers wrote, "The studies are in principle 
concerned with the relationships between color, 
form, and space. Serious painting demands serious 
study. Rembrandt, at the age of thirty, is said to have 
felt the need of twenty years of study for a certain 
color-space problem." 9 

Albers was opposed to the teaching of conventional 
art history with its emphasis on classification, 
identification and chronology to beginning students. 
He posited that it was unproductive and sterile and 
"ends too often in factual description and sentimen- 
tal likes and dislikes instead of in sensitive discrimi- 
nation." Yet in his classes he constantly referred to 
works of art and architecture. He believed that the 
teacher and artist had to have a point of view — "let 
us be no all-eater, no all-reader, no all-believer, let us 
be selective instead of being curious," he said — and 
it was largely in his comments on historical monu- 
ments that his preferences and prejudices were 
revealed. Fascinated by structures, Albers was 
especially critical of the architecture of the Renais- 
sance, which he described as the "dark age of 
architecture," because it disguised structure and 
textures with decorative elements and of Baroque 
art, a style in which he observed, "the wind in the 
clothing was more important than [the] saint 
underneath." He favored medieval architecture, 
comparing it to the tectonic structure of an insect, as 
opposed to the atectonic structure of the elephant 
which shows "no bones only skin with flesh under 
it." In student notes one finds references to the 
cathedral and Loggia dei Lanzi of Florence, Santa 
Sophia, Moorish mosques, Russian onion domes 



(created to shed snow), the supports of the college 
dining hall, the structure of the Moravian star and 
the use of parallel diagonals by the Greeks, medieval 
masons and Michelangelo as well as a comparison 
of the old Stone Bridge (Steinerne Briicke) in 
Regensburg with the George Washington Bridge in 
New York. 10 

Albers gave "silent concerts" of slides which were 
projected with little or no commentary. One such 
lecture showed only pitchers of pottery, glass, 
aluminum and other materials. In another a series of 
Pre-Columbian sculptures was followed by a Class- 
ical Greek statue and, in still another, only methods 
of treating eyes in painting and sculpture were 
shown. Albers was interested not only in formal 
elements, but also, as exemplified by the eyes in the 
paintings of Goya, in art that offers "revelation" 
rather than "representation." Periodically he taught 
Seeing of Art, a course in which styles of painting or 
works of art were analyzed. Lectures were supple- 
mented by traveling exhibitions that came to the 
college and by shows of the work of visiting artists. 11 

In an application for funds for the college workshops 
in weaving, woodworking, bookbinding, photog- 
raphy and printing, Albers wrote that at Black 
Mountain art was not limited to "fine arts" but was 
defined in the broader context of design and "con- 
structive work whose basis may be any one of many 
crafts." The student had an opportunity in the 
workshops to apply the principles studied in the 
basic courses to practical situations and to under- 
stand the underlying rules of various crafts. In an 
article on the value of the crafts to the training of 
architects, Albers argued that lack of understanding 
of both new and traditional materials in modern 
architecture "often discredited good ideas" and that 
the solution was "to integrate design with craftsman- 
ship." He objected to the rejection of machine 
products and the romantic glorification of anything 
made by hand, no matter how poor the craftsman- 
ship. Although most of the workshops had only basic 
equipment, they served the community's needs by 



54 



repairing hooks and producing furniture, programs 
foi concerts and other performances, administrative 
tonus, publicit) photographs and textiles for special 
uses. Practical requirements and financial limitations 
precluded visionarj or extravagant sthenics, yet the 
products of the workshops demonstrate an inventive- 
ness and imaginative accommodation to the circum- 
stances. Furthermore, the practical demands of the 
community gave the projects .1 constructive value not 
attained in the typical courses in which students 
merel) dabble in several crafts. Albers viewed 
photography, w hich at the time w .is taught primaril) 
m science departments, it .it all, .is .1 new handicraft 
with still unexplored possibilities, noting that "... the 
photographer does not betray his personality .is 
much b) craftsmanship .is by the intensity of his 
vision — " Ceramics was not taught during the 
Albers years .is he felt th.u clay does not otter enough 
resistance tor the beginning student and is too easily 
misused as .1 material. Hie architecture curriculum, 
added m 1940 as a consequence oi the need tor new 
buildings .it the Lake Eden campus, included the 
basic courses, experience in the workshops and con- 
struction.'" 

fining in IM44 the students had the opportunity 
to stud) with leaders m .ill areas of the visual arts 
in the special summer sessions. The faculty included 
Jean Chariot, Lyonel Feininger, Amedee Ozenfant, 
Robert Motherwell And Willcm de Kooning in 
painting; Barbara Morgan. I- Goro And Josef 
Breitenbach in photography; Walter Gropius, 
(. harles Burchard And Buckminster Fuller in architec- 
ture; Leo Ammo, Mar) t alien, C oncetta Scaravag- 
lione and Richard Lippold in sculpture; and Leo 
1 1011111 and Will Burtin in typography. For the 
summer sessions Albers tried to unite artists whose 
work was unlike his own, and he did not dictate to 
them how or what they should teach. 

As the college became known throughout the United 
States tor its art curriculum, more students interested 
in professional careers in the arts came to stud) there. 
Among Albers's BI.Kk Mountain students .ire paint- 



ers and sculptors Ruth Asawa, Elizabeth Jennerjahn, 
W 1'. Jennerjahn, Kenneth Noland, Oh Sihvonen, 

Kenneth Snelson, Robert Rauschenhcrg. Ra\ 
Johnson, Y. Y. Rankine. Flame Irbam, Robert de 
Niro and Susan Weil; book illustrators An Forberg, 
Margaret Williamson Peterson and Vera B. Williams; 
fiber artists 1 ore 1 indenfeld, Doroth) Ruddick, 1 mi 
Sihvonen and Claire Zeisler; and architects and 
designers Don Page, Si Sillman, Hcnr\ Bergman, 
Robert Bliss, ( li.ules Forberg, C laude Stoller, Albert 
I anier And Harr) Seidler. Albers constant!) warned 
his students not to get on his or anyone else's 
'"bandwagon," and the range and qualit) of the 
ssional work of students and the tact that there 
is no "Black Mountain School ot Art" is perhaps 
the best testimonial to the success ot his curriculum. 

Unlike faculty members who spent a great deal of 
time socializing with the students, Albers's contact 
came primarily through his teaching. He was not an 
easy teacher to get along with, and man) students 
objected to his authoritarian manner. He was 
dogmatic without being doctrinaire, and he expected 
his students to complete the given exercises. One- 
recalled that Albers's influence could be negative on 
some ot the students who lacked his intensity and 
liveliness, because he "created a puntv orientation 
on impressionable people sometimes to a fault And 
the) became antiseptic." Robert Rauschenberg 
commented in retrospect, "Albers was .1 beautiful 

teacher and an impossible person He w .isn't eas) 

to talk to. and I found his criticism so excruciating 
and so devastating that 1 never asked tor it. Years 
later, though, I'm still learning what he taught me, 
because what he taught had to do with the entire 
visual world — 1 consider Albers the most important 
teacher I've ever had, and I'm sure he considered me 
one ot his poorest students." 1 

Albers was .1 "teacher who gave his class first-class 
mail instead ot printed matter." And his program 
bore little resemblance to the sterile, uninspired 
design and color curriculum that later became the 
academic standard in the universities. His method 






of reaching was "a 'pedagogy of learning' rarher rhan 
a 'pedagogy of reaching.' " Problems, nor solurions, 
were presenred and rhose assigned in one class were 
worked on independenrly and discussed in rhe nexr. 
Rarher rhan constituting a solution, however, each 
study was the catalyst for another problem. Albers 
objecred ro rhe idea rhar rheory should precede prac- 
rice just as he distinguished connotative thinking, 
which produced poerry, from denorarive thinking. 
Opposed ro overvaluarion of student achievements, 
he chided rhose who signed rheir srudies as if rhey 
were works of arr and encouraged them instead to 
rhrow them out in order to keep rhe process of 
growrh open and learn many ways of doing and 
seeing rhe same rhing, which was rhe parh "ro 
freedom, avoiding rhe Demagogue.'" 4 

Nancy Newhall described Albers as an "electric 
currenr" in class. His intensity and animated manner, 
in which his gesrures and eyes conveyed as much 
information as his words, perhaps grew our of his 
early reaching experiences, when he knew only a few 
words of English. He rook a parernalisric inreresr in 
his students, and he felt it his responsibility to teach 
values, ro give a sense of direcrion and ro warn 
against blind alleys and pitfalls. For Albers rhe 
problems of arr and life were inseparable, and 
student notes are sprinkled with homilies and advice: 

Fight symmetry because it forces you from 
habit, as an educational method . . . it gives self- 
discipline. 

In art the concern is not what is right or wrong. 

Harmonious working together can be danger- 
ous. Education is not a matter of entertainment 
but (if work. 

Thinking in situations is just as important as 
thinking in conclusions. 

Emotionally meaningful form depends on re- 
lationship. 

No sol it tu m is an end. 

Great design is simple. Save your energy, save 



your scissors. 

Creation means seeing something in a new way. 
A new sensation tickles us. 

Simplicity means the reduction of complexity. 
To be simple today is a social obligation. 

Good design — proportion of effort to effect. 

One lie told many times becomes truth (!!!) 
Multiplied attention 
See Hitler! 
Value of repetition. 

Watch what's going on &amp; capture the accident. 

All art is swindel. 15 

A Black Mountain student recalled Albers pointing 
out that a short whisk of the broom before sweeping 
rhe rrash in rhe pan will keep rhe dusr from fogging. 
Anorher menrioned his raising glass cups at after- 
noon rea ro observe rhe variarion in intensity of color 
in relation to volume of tea. As a community member 
Albers did not hesirare ro chasrise rhe women 
srudenrs who wore rheir shirttails out (thus breaking 
rhe aesrhetic lines of the body) or ro caurion an 
aspiring arrisr ro pur his rime and money into his arr 
rather rhan a fancy srudio. Jean Chariot once found 
Albers on rhe farm building a fence for the pigpen. 
As there was only one hammer, Chariot sketched the 
horse while they talked. In Albers's own small garden, 
lilies and cactuses flourished alongside lertuce and 
radishes, and, unimpressed wirh American white 
bread, he had pumpernickel shipped from New York. 
Truly, ar Black Mountain teaching was "round rhe 
clock and all of a man. There was no escape. Three 
meals Together, passing in the hall, meeting in classes, 
meeting everywhere, a man taught by the way he 
walked, by the sound of his voice, by every move- 
menr." For Josef Albers art education at Black 
Mountain was education of the head, heart and 
hand. "It is inadequate to call real teaching a job," 
he wrote. "We like to see it as a kind of religion based 
on rhe belief that making ourselves and orhers 
grow — that is, making, stronger wiser, berter — is one 
of rhe highest human tasks.'" 6

A Structural Analysis of Some of Albers's Work 



CHARLES E. RICKART 



I became acquainted with Josef Albers roughly thirty 
years ago at Yale University. We were both Fellows 
of Saybrook College and at lunch would often 
discuss the possible connections of his work with 
mathematics. Albers suspected that his graphic 
constructions had a significant relation to mathemat- 
ics and naturally thought that the connection derived 
somehow from his use of geometric figures. Al- 
though this belief is partially true, there is, in my 
opinion, a much deeper and more subtle contact with 
mathematics. I have in mind here the conceptualiza- 
tion rather than the formal presentation of 
mathematics. The visualization of certain mathemat- 
ical notions appears to be very close to the perceptual 
experience produced by an Albers work, and an 
analysis of the latter suggests that similar experiences 
may occur in many other fields, including the sci- 
ences. In a science, however, phenomena of this kind 
are normally quite irrelevant to the actual subject 
matter and so are of little interest to most of its 
practitioners. This is especially true in mathematics, 
although there are some notable exceptions to the 
rule. 1 In any case, one cannot work in a field without 
thinking about it, so conceptualization must occur 
whether or not it is formally recognized. 

The germ of the ideas presented here dates back to 
my first serious examination of Albers's art, which 
occurred soon after I met him. It primarily concerns 
the illusion of motion that is produced by many of 



his works. There are some brief comments on this 
effect in my book Structuralism and Structures, 
where I use it to exemplify certain features of the 
mind's ability to deal with structures. 1 The present 
essay grew out of those comments. 

Although I communicated my early thoughts on the 
subject to Albers many years ago, I never obtained 
a very definite reaction from him. Therefore, since 
the ideas seemed so natural to me, I concluded that 
Albers probably regarded them as either obvious or 
naive, and I did not press the matter. Upon reflection 
I have come to believe that either I failed to make 
my point or my rather prosaic ideas did not fit in 
with his own very poetic explanations of his work. 
I also recognize that Albers was interested in myriad 
other visual effects along with a wide variety of 
techniques for producing them, so the illusion of 
motion might have appeared a relatively small part 
of the whole. In any case I believe that the issue of 
how or why one experiences this illusion is important 
not only because it bears on most of the other effects 
his work can produce, but also because it casts some 
light on the way the human mind processes certain 
information. Artistic creations like those of Albers, 
because they are so pure and uncluttered, are 
especially appropriate for probing such workings of 
the mind. And as I have emphasized in my book, 
mathematics, though less accessible, can play a 
similar role for the same reasons.

Since I am in no sense an expert on art. the point 
of view outlined here is noi onlj ver) limited but 
also lacks the usual embellishments expected in a 
commentary ol this kind. An expert will probabl) 
note places where I have overlooked contributions 
bj others or have naivel) belabored ideas perhaps 
obvious to everyone else. 1 hope that the reader will 
make the necessar) allowances. 1 inally I would like 
to thank Nicholas Weber, who is so familiar with 
everything concerning Mints, for his kind encour- 
agement, without which I never would have had the 
nerve to attempt this project. 

I he following discussion, as alread) indicated, 
proceeds from the point ol view ol general "struc- 
tures." Underlying this approach is the observation 
that the mind, in an attempt to deal with presented 
material, will automatiealh structure, in some form 
01 other, the information contained therein. As we 
might expect, the structuring process is very inti- 
mately connected to understanding .\nJ tends to 
operate onl) on potentially "meaningful" informa- 
tion. Moreover, the process is actually "built-in" and 
so does not have to be learned, though it is modified 
bj experience and ma) develop differently according 
to the individual. Some awareness of the process, 
despite its automatic character, ma) facilitate the 
formation and improve the qualit) of the result, as 
well as add great!) to our understanding ol how the 
mmd deals with information. Although the struc- 
tures involved in the process ma) be extremel) 
complex, those considered here are relativel) simple 
and. up to a point, not ver) difficult to analyze. 

All creative activit) is highly structural in character, 
invoh ing first ol all the mental structuring processes 
ot the originator. Bui it also involves the individuals 
to w horn the fruit oi this activit) is directed. I he 
work can ies a message, and the originator must take 
into account, perhaps unconsciously, the manner m 
which it will be received. I his amounts to an 
anticipation ol how a prospective recipient ma) 
structure the information contained in the message. 



In fact the product normall) contains mam features 
designed to influence this structuring process, and 
the) are often surprising!) detailed. Techniques for 
exercising such control \ar\ greatl) in kind and 
complexity. A simple and familiar example is an 
artist's use of composition to influence the wa) in 
which a viewer's attention moves from one portion 
of a painting to another. A quite different example 
is the careful organization of a good piece of w riting. 
Controls of this type, which usuall) operate very 
subtly, pla) an especially important role in Albers's 
art. 

Albers's graphic constructions, which consist of 
highly structured arrangements of line segments in 
a plane, are b) far the easiest of his works to analyze. 
I hough ftco-dimensional, the line arrangements are 
such that they are perceived immediately, b) most 
observers, as representations of f/?ree-dimensional 
objects m space made up of various plane sections. 
Yet the viewer quicklv becomes aware that no such 
objects can exist in real space. It is this setup, with 
its apparentl) conflicting message, that gives rise to 
the illusion of motion. The objective of the present 
ess.iv is to try to explain exactlv how And why this 
happens, lor simplicity's sake most of the detailed 
analysis that follows is confined to pist one of the 
graphic constructions. 

It is worth noting that there are individuals who are 
unable to experience this sense of motion. One 
possible explanation tor this mav be a limitation in 
their ability to visualize three-dimensional objects 
as represented b) two-dimensional figures. In fact I 
have encountered a few students who, as tar as I 
could tell, were unable to •"see" three-dimensional 
objects represented b) carefully rendered drawings 
on the chalkboard. Unfortunately such persons will 
be denied the unique experience that most of us enjo) 
in viewing the Albers constructions. 

Now let us consider the two figures that follow; 
which are reproduced in Albers's delightful little 
book. Despite Straight I ines. x 








They constitute the last in a group of four pairs that 
are accompanied by the following poetic comments 
by the artist: 

4 Pairs of Structural Constellations 

Within a formal limitation of equal contours 
as mutual silhouette, these pairs show different 
hut related plastic movements of lines, plain's, 
volumes. 

Thus, they change 

in motion: from coming to going, 

in extension: from inward to outward, 

in grouping: from together to separated, 

in volume: from full to empty, 

or reversed. 

And all this, in order to show extended 
flexibility. 

|. A. 



It is clear from his remarks that Albers's primary- 
objective in the drawings was to create a complex 
illusion of motion for the viewer. He accomplished 
this by arranging the lines in remarkably clever ways. 
I will next examine the actual process by which the 
impression of motion is produced. It will be sufficient 
to concentrate on the top member of the pair. 

We observe first that although the complete figure 
cannot be read in any way as representing a spatial 
object, certain of its parts can be so interpreted, often 
in more than one way. Moreover, in each case the 
only ambiguity is in which interpretation the viewer 
fixes upon. For example when we consider the 
reproductions on the facing page of three over- 
lapping parts of the figure, we note that h and c 
may be obtained from a by adding symmetric 
portions of the complete figure. 

Part a admits two three-dimensional interpretations: 
the first, in which the middle panels extending from 
top left to bottom right appear to slope away from 
us (z); and the second, in which they appear to slope 
toward us (2). We note that in 1 we are looking up 
at the panels and in 2 we are looking down on them. 
In the case of b there is only one possible reading, 
since the additions to a which yield b "force" an 
interpretation consistent with 1. This occurs primar- 
ily because the U-shaped addition on the right admits 
a unique interpretation in which we are looking up 
at its base. This view is reinforced by plane segments 
such as the one labeled Q. Similarly, c admits only 
the interpretation consistent with 2. Therefore the 
complete figure, because of the conflicting readings 
demanded by its parts b and c, cannot represent a 
three-dimensional object. In other words, as far as 
relevance to a "rear 1 object is concerned, the 
information contained in the figure is definitely 
contradictory. It is interesting to recall that Albers 
called these constructions "illogical" and in conver- 
sation referred to them as "my nonsense." 

Both the mind's persistent drive to extract meaning 
from information, and its tendency to interpret two- 



60 






dimensional, perhaps retinal data .is if it originated 
in .1 three-dimensional object, .ire universal auto- 
matic responses essential for coping with the outside 
world. However it the given information contains 
.in obvious contradiction, the natural response 
would seem to be to reject it .is irrelevant. Therefore 
in the case that interests lis, we might expect an 
observer to abandon an) attempt to make .1 three- 
dimensional interpretation of the figure and simpl) 
accept a two-dimensional picture. That this does not 
normall) occur suggests that the drive to interpret 
figures in three dimensions And to acquire useful 
meaning is more basic than the intellectual demand 
tor l0-4iv_.il consistency. 

We must not conclude, however, that the mind 
blindl) accepts contradictor) information. In tact it 
appears to abhor a contradiction, and when dim.- does 
arise in a presumabl) meaningful situation, the mind 
will attempt to resolve it at all costs. Resolving an 
obvious contradiction such as the one we are 
considering would seem to require a hit of magic. 
Indeed the result is rather magical, though the trick 
is actuall) quite simple— just change the rules of the 
game. 

As alread) suggested the mind's initial impulse is to 
interpret two-dimensional information as coming 
from a fixed three-dimensional object. Since this is 
not possible, something has to yield. I he trick is to 



allow a solution that is not fixed. I his additional 
freedom allows the mind to create an illusion of a 
variable three-dimensional object, one that may 
change from a particular form to another, so that 
some part ot it, in each state, will represent a valid 
portion of the given information. Thus, a shift ot 
attention from one part of the i_.iv en figure to another 
part, instead ot resulting in frustration and contu- 
sion, actually provides the drive tor transforming the 
illusory object from one state to another. 

This anabsis ma) be applied to the bottom element 
in the illustrated pair And. in tact, to an) ot Albers's 
graphic constructions that produce an illusion ot 
motion. It even applies to parts a, l&gt; -\nd c of the top 
figure m the pair. In the case of ./, we observe that 
the ambiguity of two valid interpretations is itself a 
contradiction which may be resolved bv a shift of 
attention from one interpretation to the other, gi\ ing 
the "flip-flop" motion common to main ordinary 
optical illusions. Part h produces an effect similar 
to that ot the complete figure but much weaker. This 
arises because the one valid three-dimensional 
interpretation, though tending to dominate, is 
challenged locallv 111 the left portion of the figure 
bv the contradictor) interpretation consistent with 
j. I he same effect occurs in the case of part c. 

It should be noted that the above analvsis addresses 
onlv a tew basic features of the actual experience, 



... 



which is considerably more complex than might be 
expected. For example, in addition to the transfor- 
mation of inside or outside corners into their 
opposite, so familiar in ordinary optical illusions, 
the middle planes appear to twist and turn as they 
change their directions. There are also subtle local 
effects, one of which is illustrated by the behavior 
of the three plane segments P, Q and R indicated in 
/;. In what is usually the first interpretation of b, Q 
and R together constitute a plane segment that 
appears to lie behind P. However in the contradic- 
tory, local interpretation, obtained by starting at the 
upper left, R sits forward of P while Q joins the 
two and forms an angle with each. Thus, in the 
transitions, the plane formed initially by Q and R 
undergoes a flexing motion. We also discover that 
once we are caught up in this experience, we are 
virtually forced to take an active role in the process 
by orchestrating the transformations, exploring 
local effects and trying to recover or re-create effects 
after they have disappeared. 

Finally, as Albers suggested in his comments on the 
"4 Pairs," the illusory objects associated with the 
two figures in a given pair also interact with one 
another — an effect somewhat more difficult to 
elicit — and this further enriches the total experience. 
The result has a dynamic quality wholly unique to 
Albers's art. All of the effects are carefully planned 
by the artist and are brought about by means of a 
very precise and subtle placement of line segments, 
sometimes appropriately emphasized, which direct 
and control the observer's attention. Needless to say, 
a full appreciation requires an extended period of 
relaxed and patient viewing. It is also helpful to read 
Albers's own comments on some of the individual 
constructions included in Despite Straight Lines and 
on his teaching methods described in Search Versus 
Re-Search. 4 

An analysis similar to the above may be applied to 
Albers's color constructions. Like the graphic 
constructions, they produce an illusion of motion 



by virtue of the contradictory messages they carry. 
In this case, however, the messages involve certain 
subtle characteristics of color perception which are 
not very familiar or obvious to the inexperienced 
observer. As far as motion is concerned, the property 
of interest is that in a collection of colors, some will 
be seen as advanced or receded in relation to the 
others. The perception will depend, of course, on 
the relative masses, intensities and arrangement of 
the various colors. Moreover, these effects can occur 
between different shades of the same color, even 
gray. Albers's well-known book Interaction of Color 
contains illustrations and discussions of these and 
many other remarkable properties of color percep- 
tion.'' Yet in contrast with the line drawings, an 
explanation of how and why the color constructions 
produce their effects is not so easily formed. 

In these constructions the interaction between the 
colors of several regions produces messages concern- 
ing their relative fore and aft positions. Similar 
messages may also be conveyed geometrically or by 
the way the regions overlap. For example some areas 
may be depicted as semitransparent so that one field 
will seem as if it is seen through another. If such 
messages are contradictory, the stage is then set for 
an illusion of motion, just as in the previous case. 
The result, however, has a character somewhat 
different from that of the drawings. Here, perhaps 
because of a qualitative difference in the messages, 
the motion tends to be smoother and less cyclic. In 
fact all of the color effects, as compared to the 
graphics, are quite subtle and more difficult to 
analyze. This is especially true for certain of Albers's 
ubiquitous Homages to the Square. 

An expert could no doubt cite many other examples 
of works of art, such as certain sculptures, which 
produce effects analogous to those we are discussing. 
Moreover, the phenomenon is not confined to visual 
perception. Settings for it are easy to identify in many 
fields, such as physics, mathematics, music, poetry 
and literature. Their common feature is that each 



62 



presents to the mind, in one form or another, a 
challenge to integrate into one meaningful whole 
two &lt;&gt;r more conflicting or perhaps competing sets 
of information, ["he product of the synthesis will 
generall) have .1 character quite different from the 
separate components. And when the information is 
not visual, the results arc usually more difficult to 
describe and therefore appear to be more subjective. 
But the present essay is not the place to attempt .1 
detailed analysis ol these examples. 

One more comment should be made concerning 
abstract works such .is those by Albers. As already 
indicated, although the mind will normally strive to 

m.ike sense of presented information, that effort will 
be aborted without some evidence ol its potential 
meaningfulness. In some cases the opinion of an 



authority on the subject or the simple fact that the 
work exists ma\ suffice as evidence, lor the Albers 
constructions, it is provided in part b) the three- 
dimensional fragments contained in the figures. 
However another source is at least as important as 
any of these. It is a sense of the artist's competence 
and integrity, with the consequent assurance that the 
work does have content. Although with some artists 
such assurance may be rather elusive, this is not true 
of Albers — his superb technique and the resulting 
meticulous constructions leave little room tor doubt, 
lew observers will have am trouble accepting the 
challenge to participate in the rewarding creative 
experience that Albers's graphic and color construc- 
tions

New Challenges Beyond the Studio: 
The Murals and Sculpture of Josef Albers 



NEAL BENEZRA 



In October 1949 Walter Gropius invited his longtime 
friend and former Banhaus colleague Josef Albers 
to design a large brick wall in a new graduate 
commons building that his firm, The Architects' 
Collaborative, had designed for Harvard University. 
Although Albers had never worked in brick, he had 
completed a number of art-in-architecture projects 
in the 1910s and 1920s, and he was pleased by the 
new challenge. The completed work, America (fig. 
1), encapsulates Albers's views on the ideal interac- 
tion of art and architecture at that time. It is a brick 
mural consisting of no additive elements whatsoever; 
instead, the composition resides where the artist 
removed bricks from the Flemish bond structure that 
he selected for the wall. That is, the design is 
conveyed exclusively in the horizontal voids in the 
wall and the resulting vertical ranges that the aligned 
spaces create, a formal concept based in the "sky- 
scraper" style which Albers evolved in the 1920s. 
He described America in 1952. as: 

respect[ing] and preserving the wall] to the last 
degree possible. . . . instead of making a free 
arrangement of bricks, . . . by application of 
protruding and receding bricks, I decided to 
keep the flatness of the front intact . . . /itst as on 
the outside brick walls.' 

In its conception and even its design, America offers 
a model of Bauhaus-style collaboration, with art 
serving at the pleasure of architecture. In his program 
for the Graduate Center, Gropius sought to establish 
a rhythm of sequentially ordered and interlocking 



forms and spaces, in both plan and elevation. This 
formal theme was consistent with his early master- 
works, the Werkbund Pavilion in Cologne ( 1914) and 
the Bauhaus complex at Dessau (1926), and it was 
communicated to Albers early in the planning stages 
of the Harvard project. 1 In deference to his architect, 
Albers produced a design of tightly interwoven and 
interpenetrating solids and voids, a composition 
which responds cleverly to the Gropius plan. Indeed, 
in his statement on the mural, Albers reaffirmed his 
strong belief in the responsibility of the artist to 
conform to the architect's prerogatives in such 
projects: 

/ believe that any design organically connected 
with an architectural structure should he related 
to that structure no matter whether this design 
is to emphasize or to complete, to change or to 
correct, the appearance or function of the 
building or space concerned. ; 

Albers would complete twenty additional art-in- 
architecture projects after 1950, and these experi- 
ences would radically alter his deferential attitude. 
This largely unknown body of work includes a wide 
range of materials and formats, among them photo- 
sensitive glass windows, compositions in brick, 
formica and gold-leaf murals, reliefs in stainless steel 
and one extraordinary freestanding sculpture. 
Although the artist's reliance on architects in 
transforming the unforgiving geometry of his small- 
scale work to public sites was initially very strong, 
111 time he would seek independence from their

dictates. I lie stor) of |osef Albers's art-in-architec- 
cure projects is that of .1 painter venturing outside 
the secure and established procedures &lt;&gt;t Ins studio, 
and confronting and eventuall) controlling the 
appearance of his work in public. -1 

Albers's respect tor architects and architecture was 
longstanding, dating to the 19x0s and his formative 
experience .it the Bauhaus. Conceived In Gropius 
u ith the aim of regenerating the .uts and crafts under 
the mantle of architecture, the philosoph) ol the 
Bauhaus was delineated In the architect in his often- 
quoted manifesto ol 1919: 

The ultimate aim of all visual arts is the complete 
building! To embellish buildings was once the 
noblest function of the fine arts; they were the 
indispensable components of great architecture. 
Today the arts exist m isolation, from which they 
can be rescued only through the conscious. 
&lt;erative effort of all craftsmen — Together 
let us desire, conceive, and create the new 
structure of the future, which will embrace 
architecture and sculpture ami painting m one 
unity. ..." 

In man) ways Albers personified this Bauhaus ideal. 
A student from [919 t&lt;&gt; 1911. he went on to teach 
at the Bauhaus until its forced closure in 193 3. 
Promoted to the level of journeyman there in wii, 
Albers did not paint, hut rather involved himself in 
a number of constructive activities which 
predisposed him to his later art-m-arclntecture work. 
1 . 11 example he w as charged with the reorganization 
of the glass workshop and taught there; and he 
executed a number of stained- and single-pane glass 
compositions. In his later years at the Bauhaus. 
Albers directed the furniture workshop as well as 
the wallpaper design program. Indeed, two of his 
closest friends there were Gropius .u^\ Marcel 
Breuer, and it was through these architects and their 
students that Albers received main of Ins subsequent 
art-in-archirecture commissions.

Following Albers's emigration to the United States 
in 1955, he found another crucial source which 
reinforced his profound respect for the primacy of 
architects and architecture. Beginning in 1935 Josef 
and Anni Albers visited Latin America on fourteen 
occasions. 6 They lectured, worked and traveled 
during these trips, and in the process they became 
passionate admirers of Pre-Columbian art and 
architecture. Albers was particularly enamored of 
the sculptural character of such monuments as the 
pyramid at Tenayuca, north of Mexico City, and the 
exquisite carved reliefs of the Palace of the Columns 
at Mitla, in Oaxaca, and he took numerous photo- 
graphs at these and other sites (figs. 2, 3). For him 
these structures revealed an extraordinary conjunc- 
tion of architecture and sculpture, a union largely 
unknown in Europe since the Middle Ages. As a 
product of the Bauhaus, Albers believed that western 
culture had emphasized — indeed abused — the no- 
tion of creative individuality at the expense of 
productive collaboration, and he found his idealism 
confirmed in these magnificent, sun-bleached walls. 

While Albers's travels in Latin America intensified 
his belief in the collaborative ideal, the figure-ground 
equivalence that prevails in Pre-Columbian sculpture 
proved an important formal influence in works such 
as America. By the late 1930s Albers came to 
characterize sculpture as "active volume," a defini- 
tion which ended the "separation of figure and 
background and the separation of high and low." 
Always a strong believer in the humanistic implica- 
tions of form, the artist also felt that figure-ground 
equivalence implied a "very valuable social 
philosophy, namely real democracy: every part 
serves and at the same time is served." 

If America exemplified the collaborative process, it 
also functioned as a prototype for several future 
efforts in brick. During the 1950s and 1960s, Albers 
designed five additional brick reliefs, foremost 
among them a pair of domestic fireplaces in Connect- 
icut homes and a large altar-wall triptych for a 
church in Oklahoma City. Both fireplaces were

architecture professor King 1 ui Wu. A graduate of 
1 Ian ard's ( Graduate School of Design, \\ u knew and 
admired America, and he commissioned the artist 
i" contribute fireplace designs to two of his earliest 
projects, the Irving Rouse House in North Haven 
of [955 fig. 4 . and the Benjamin DuPont House 
in Woodbridge of [958-59." In both instances Albers 
responded \\ ith more sculptural designs than he had 
produced previously. In them numerous courses . . r 
brick are set diagonally into the \\ all, thus increasing 
the number of light-reflecting surfaces and creating 
.1 strong and \ ibrani pattern of light and cast shadow. 

Albers's I. truest and most compelling work in brick 
dating from tins period is the St. Patrick's Altar Wall 
of [961 fig. 5 . 9 Standing eighteen b) fort) feet and 
brillantl) colored with gold leaf, the altar wall 



represents an extraordinary step beyond its predeces- 
sors. In design it benefits from the .mist's previous 
brick reliefs, with courses again projecting from the 
plane of the wall with mathematical regularity. The 
great si/e of the wall and its placement in a religious 
setting suggested the recess of two vertical courses 
of brick into shadow, therein di\ iding the w hole into 
triptych format. Adding to the power of the composi- 
tion is the gold leaf, which is applied to the lengths 
but not the ends ot the hrieks. This enhances the 
shimmering interpla) ot light and deep shadow, an 
effect w hich heightens the \ isual intensity ot Albers's 
first important sculpture. 

md these formal advances the St. Patrick's Altai 
Willi represents the fust instance in which the artist's 
sculpture dominates an architectural space. The nave- 
ls a virtual!) unmediated horizontal expanse, with

only a glass wall separating the congregation from 
an open ambulatory beyond. The altar wall is a 
compelling, radiant presence, and it rescues the nave 
from its complete lack of spatial focus. In its 
dominance of a religious space, the altar wall recalls 
the retables which Albers had seen in Bavaria in his 
youth, as well as those in the Colonial churches of 
Cuzco and Arequipa which he had photographed 
while in Peru in the 1950s. 10 Indeed, the breadth of 
the artist's field of aesthetic interest and reference 
was greater than is often supposed, and he found 
much inspiration in these retables, transforming 
them with all his admirable power of restraint into 
a monument of quiet but compelling spirituality. 

The man responsible for the Oklahoma City commis- 
sion was Frank Kacmarcik, consultant on art and 
liturgy at St. Patrick's. It was Kacmarcik who 
proposed Albers to the officials at St. Patrick's and 



to the architects of the church, the Tulsa firm of 
Murray-Jones-Murray. Kacmarcik's knowledge of 
Albers's art-in-architecture projects was firsthand 
and longstanding, as he had also served for many 
years as consultant to the Benedictine community 
of St. John in Collegeville, Minnesota. In the mid- 
1950s this had been the site of Albers's work with 
Breuer, a collaboration which resulted in White 
Cross Window of 1955 (fig. 6)." 

Installed in the small abbot's chapel of St. John's 
Abbey, White Cross Windoic is among Albers's most 
remarkable efforts in any medium. The window 
consists of thirty-one small panes of photosensitive 
glass joined by a framework of staggered wooden 
mullions. The composition — a complex, mathemat- 
ically ordered arrangement in four shades of gray — is 
activated by the sensitivity of the glass to light. Such 
an idea became a realistic possibility only in the 



68 




Sommerfeld Window. i&gt;c: destroyed 

Stained ulass 

Sommerfeld House, Berlin-Dahlem 



1940s, when scientists discovered that when exposed 
photographically, a single paneoi glass would yield 
.1 surprising range ol tones within .1 single hue. 13 
I luis AJbers could place constrasting shades of gra) 
beside one another w ithout the leading ol traditional 
stained glass. Beyond eliminating the need tor 
leading, this discover) made possible the design of 
a monochrome window whose tones are not si. uk 
bui instead respond to light in .1 variet) of ways. 
Because White I ross Windou is made of photosen 
sitive glass, its composition changes according to the 
direction and qualit) of the dominant light-source. 
As .1 result, at night, when artificial illumination 
replaces daylight, the tones of the glass reverse in 
value— dark areas become light and light areas 
become dark — an effect which complete!) trans 
forms the composition of the window as a whole. 

Mhers's interest in glass ^..\n be traced to his child- 



hood, as he was trained in the craft of stained glass 
at home b) his father. In fact the artist's hrst art-m- 
architecture project dates to [917-18, when he was 
asked to design a stained-glass window for a church 
in his native Bottrop. West Germany." dlass was 
Alhers's primar) material throughout the Bauhaus 
sears, and it was on the basis of .1 bod) of as- 
semblages composed of discarded glass that he was 
promoted to the level of journeyman in [922. In this 
position he w as charged with the reorganization and 
direction of the glass workshop. While teaching In- 
completed several commissions, the most important 
of which resulted in the now '-destroyed Sommerfeld 
Window, part of the well-known architectural 
commission tor a house in Berlin-Dahlem completed 
In ( Iropius in ion tig. - . 

It would he difficult to overstate the important role 
w hich glass held in the development of Alhers's work. 






Geometry only became a consistent element of his 
art in the mid-i920s, when he perfected a new 
process for sandblasting glass employing — as he 
would do with White Cross Window some thirty 
years later — a recently developed industrial 
technique to create a new form of expression in glass. 
As early as 1925 Albers had transformed the glazier's 
traditional craft into an expressly modern endeavor, 
with the hard-edged templates required for 
sandblasting yielding the geometry which would 
characterize his lifelong artistic style. 

A postscript must be added to this account of the St. 
John's commission, since White Cross Windoiv was 
to constitute only the first step of a much larger 
project. From their correspondence it is clear that 
both Albers and Breuer considered the window in 
the abbot's chapel to be experimental. If photosensi- 
tive glass could be designed successfully, it would 
also be employed much more extensively in the 
Abbey Church. This structure, which was completed 
in 1961, was to feature an enormous north window- 
wall consisting of 650 windows by Albers. 

By 1958 the artist had finished his design and a now- 
lost model of the windows, which he presented at 
the abbey in 1959. Yet through a complex series of 
misunderstandings, Albers was not awarded the 
commission; it went instead to a lay member of the 
faculty at St. John's."" Whether the fault lay with 
Breuer or with the patrons, Albers felt badly be- 
trayed. This was but the first instance in which the 
artist was victimized by circumstances in his art-in- 
architecture projects, and he would slowly come to 
reassess his former idealism regarding the value of 
collaborative endeavor. This realization would have 
extraordinary consequences in his later work. 

By the late 1950s, Albers's art-in-architecture efforts 
had become well known among architects. Because 
of his reputation and that of Gropius and of Breuer, 
America and White Cross Windoiv were published 
extensively, particularly in architectural journals. As 
a result, Albers, who celebrated his seventieth 
birthday in [958, was now ottered and accepted an 



increasing number of commissions. In the main these 
opportunities were of a much different order than 
the earlier ones. Although he would work again with 
Gropius in 1963, most of his new collaborators were 
not peers but proteges, architects who had been 
Albers's students at Black Mountain or Yale, or 
associates of Gropius or Breuer. These jobs often 
involved the design of murals for skyscraper lobbies, 
many of which are in New York, and they thus 
provided Albers with unparalleled opportunities to 
place his work in public settings. In most cases the 
artist responded by altering the materials and 
enhancing the scale of his small-scale work, an 
ambition which he had long held. 

Two of these murals were particularly successful and 
influential. The first, commissioned and completed 
in 1959, is Two Structural Constellations (fig. 8), a 
pair of linear configurations incised in gold leaf on 
one wall of the Corning Glass Building lobby in 
midtown Manhattan. Composed of a striking black 
Carrara glass ceiling and crisp white Vermont marble 
walls, Harrison and Abramovitz's lobby showcases 
the racing lines of Albers's most refined and elegant 
mural.' 6 

Albers was fascinated by his first urban mural 
commission, both because it allowed the public 
greater access to his work, and because he relished 
the challenge of expressing the pace of New York 
City. He was thrilled by the dynamism of New York, 
and he considered the Structural Constellations, a 
series he had begun around 1950 in which diagonal 
lines predominate, to be equal to the compelling 
urban rhythm. The Structural Constellations were 
conceived by plotting and then linking points on 
small sheets of graph paper. By maintaining the same 
coordinates but altering the lines that join them, the 
artist could achieve endless variations on a single 
compositional theme. The Constellations exist in 
drawings, engraved plastic and a variety of graphic 
media (see cat. nos. 171-176). 

Beyond their elegance and effectiveness as mural 
decoration, when expanded greatly in size the 



-o

istellations assumed enhanced formal valu 
the artist. Ar their original scale, these complex 
graphic configurations were like puzzles, offering the 
viewer .1 range o'f contrasting linear readings. W hen 
monumentalized the Constellations appeared more 
expansive and allusive; compositions which once 
seemed small and playful now suggested vast spatial 
enclosures or darting planes. This realization proved 
provocative for Albers, and he would soon emploj 
the- ( 'onstellations as the predominant motifs of his 
relief sculptures. 

AJbers's other major New York mural, Manhattan 
of [96 ;, is perhaps even more d\ ii.uiik and success 
tul than the first one fig. 9 . ,? Measuring twenty- 
eight b) fifty-four feet and mounted above the 
bustling escalators linking the Pan Am Building and 
Grand Central terminal, this is doubtless Albers's 
most frequentl) viewed work. Commissioned b) 



( Iropius for 1 men Roth's Pan Am Building, Manhat- 
tan is, like Two Structural Constellations, a compel- 
ling response to a vibrant urban environment. The 
Pan Am lobb) is reallj a concourse, a well-lubricated 

architectural machine in which escalators tunnel 
pedestrians at a rapid pace between Grand C entral 
and the surrounding streets of New York. 

I he work evolved from a suggestion b\ Gropius, 
who proposed that Alhers adapt ( ity of o&gt;z y 
10)— one of the artist's finest sandblasted-glass 
pictures — to the scale And proportions of the Pan 
Am site. City had been acquired by the Kunsthaus 
Zurich m i960 And was reproduced in the museum's 
journal that same year. Alhers possessed numerous 
offprints of the publication and. in a fascinating 
reapplication of his ow n ideas, he used the published 
black And w hite photograph of the work as the basis 
for sketches for the mural tig. 11 .

Two Structural Constellations and Manhattan are 
.minim fosel Mbers's finest large-scale works, and 
each hud important implications for Ins future 
efforts. Manhattan would prove to be his hist 

important indoor mural, as n was the final instance 
in which the site would enhance the artist's design. 
More often than not, Albers was invited to contrib 
uit to architecture which aspired to nothing more 
than functional clarity, with lobbies designed to 
move large quantities ol people with minimum delay. 
I he specific position ol a mural would often be 
predetermined h\ the architect, and the artist often 
found his work obstructed by pillars, columns or 
other harriers. Although the design and impact ol 
Manhattan would influence Albers's last work, for 
the Stanford University campus, throughout the 
remainder ol his life he would to^us primarily on 
sculpture, particularly the application of the ( .oust ci- 
tations in relief. 

Within months after the completion ol Two Struc- 
tural i onstellations, Ubers described a new interest, 
which he termed "structural sculpture": 

Following the history 0/ sculpture, it is amazing 
to see for how long it has restricted itself to 
volume almost exclusively.... Centuries 
predominantly voluminous sculpture are being 
onfronted today by a strong trend toward 
linear sculpture, toward sculpture combined and 
constructed .... Finally .1 few independent 



\us enough to cot 
trate on the plane, the in-between &lt;&gt;/ volume and 
line, as a broad sculptural concept and promise. 
It is .1 promise, truly new and exciting: Structural 
Sculpture. Because it traverses the separation of 
2 and ; dimensu 

On a formal level it was precisely this conjunction 

of two and three dimensions w hkh Albers attempted 
in his late outdoor reliefs. Two Structural Constella- 
tions introduced this possibility, tor it ottered him 
the opportunity to visualize his purely linear work 
in planar and thus sculptural terms tor the first time. 
Ilu challenge he assumed lay in the possibility &lt;&gt;t 
creating three-dimensional illusion through strictb 
two-dimensional means. Me achieved this by con- 
structing Constellations oi stainless steel and on a 
large scale, and affixing the reliefs to the facades of 
prominent buildings. Perhaps more important, these 
works also signaled a shift aw ay from Albers's initial 
attitude of deference to his architect. In them the 
artist emphatically proclaimed the lines of his 
sculpture as possessing the strength to challenge the 
masses and materials oi architecture. 

I he first occasion tor such a project came with the 
completion oi Paul Rudolph's Art and Architecture 
Building at Vale in [963." When Rudolph decided 
t( 1 .n\A sculpture to the facade of his already distinctly 
sculptural building, he approached Albers who, 
although retired as chairman of the art school since 
[958, had continued to teach until i960. The artist 
agreed to contribute a work, and the result was 
Repeat ami Reverse 196 •■, , a stainless steel ( 'onstel- 
lation w huh w as affixed directly above the principal 
entrance to the building figs. 1:.. \\ . 

On most facades such placement would be ideal. 
However the entrance to Rudolph's building is set 
well back from the street and is not a prominent 
element in the overall design. In addition, the wall 
above the doorway is narrow. Due to these factors. 
Repeat and Reverse is extremely cramped in its 
chosen location. Further, it does not enjoy adequate

lines ol sight, .in unfortunate circumstance for an) 
sculpture, and .ill the more tragic in this &gt;.asc given 
Albers's long and influential tenure ai Yale. 

Yet, surprisingly, ii was Albers himself who selected 
the setting. I his occurred against the better judgment 
of Rudolph, who recalls: "Mr. Albers selected the 
ise location, although I must vn that 1 never 
thought it well-placed." Vs Albers was .1 frequent 
visitor to the school even after his retirement, it is 
inconceivable that lie would not have realized the 
draw backs of the sue. (. learly his desire to see Repeat 
and Reverse above the entrance— as .1 contemporary 
portal or pediment sculpture— outweighed .ill other 
considerations. 

fibers responded similarly when united to design .1 
sculpture for the facade of the I andesmuseum in 
Minister. 1 he setting in this case was .1 newly 
expanded museum and. more specifically, the new 
entrance to the building, which fronted the city's 
central cathedral plaza. Albers, who had grown up 
in nearb) Bottrop, who had made drawings m the 
nave of the Minister ( athedral as a young man, m\*\ 
who had been the subject of important exhibitions 
at the Landesmuseum in [959 and [968, knew 
exactly what to do with the opportunity. According 
to architect Bernd Kosters, during a visit to the 
museum to discuss the project: "Professor \lbers 
went immediately to the side of the building with 
the mam entrance and said he vv anted to work there. 
In addition, he also made it clear that he was not 
thinking of a mural in color, but of a sculpture." 

Although not without certain problems, the work 
completed in 1972, lit" Supraportas — meaning 
literall) "two elements above the doors" — is a 
marked success fig. 14 . The two Constellations that 

Albers selected are attached to the facade, which 
projects directly over the entrance to the museum. 
I lie\ are affixed to a series of five charcoal-gray 
granite panels, which recede left to right in parallel 
stepped planes. Although the facade steps back 
approximately ten feet from side to side. Albers 
insisted — against the will of his architect, once 



again — that the ( onstellations span these large 
spatial divisions. I nta/ed b) either architectural 
dictate or difficult structural problems, he moved 
boldly ahead and assumed control of the project him- 
self. 

Albers's determination had altogether happ) 
Sequences tor the finished work, as Kosters proved 
a remarkable collaborator. 1 1c kept the artist abreast 
of the project throughout its manv phases, and 
solicited Albers's advice on numerous issues pertain- 
ing to design and materials. For his part the artist 
immersed himself in these details, and his 
correspondence reveals surprising insight into 
obscure construction matters. This communication 
made it possible tor Albers to expand his design verv 
accurately, a difficult achievement given the precise 
geometry of the graphic work. 

Albers was especially pleased with the finished 
sculpture and remarked that it appeared "unbeliev- 
ably thin and light... so volumetric like three- 
dimensional sculpture." 2 ' Two Supraportas is also 
tremendously successful as au expressly modern 
public emblem, particularly when mounted above 
the entrance to a museum. Although tar more 
successful than the Vale sculpture, both Two Sup- 
raportas and Rcpc.it and Reverse evidence Albers's 
understanding of the traditional appearance and 
meaning of portal and pediment sculpture. With 
their dynamic shapes and sleek materials, these 
works are distinctly modern public forms, and their 
placement grants them extraordinary visihilirv and 
power. 

When [osel Albers died in March 1976, two projects 

remained unfinished. The first, An enormous relief

student of Albers at Black Mountain in i&lt;.&gt;4 - and a 
longtime friend. As conceived and sited the relief

plays an integral role in Seidler's Mutual Life Centre, 
an extensive office and retail complex in Sydney, 
Australia. The main element of the center is an 
imposing seventy-story office tower, which was 
nearing completion at the time Wrestling was 
mounted. 

In designing the complex, Seidler faced a number of 
challenging dilemmas. 14 The complex stands in the 
center of Sydney, and the large side-wall of an 
existing building faced disagreeably on his site. 
Beyond needing to sheathe this intrusive structure, 
Seidler also sought to add a form which might 
mediate the scale and visual power of his tower. At 
seventy stories the MLC Tower was the tallest 
building in the southern hemisphere at the time of 
its construction, and it was much taller than any of 
the buildings in the area. 

Knowing of Albers's recent work in Minister, Seidler 
invited the artist to contribute a relief to the complex. 
He did so with the knowledge that Albers's graphic 
work could handle architectural scale, and he also 
believed that a very large relief would assist in solving 
his complicated problem. As the construction 
photograph demonstrates, when mounted on a black 
wall Wrestling sheathes the neighboring facade to 
great effect. Even more impressive, however, is the 
manner in which it graduates the scale of the tower. 

In contrast to Wrestling, which lacked only installa- 
tion at the time of Albers's death, the Stanford Wall 
would not be completed until 1980, nearly ten years 
after the project was conceived. Such a long gestation 
period was necessary because of the exceedingly 
complex nature of the work. The design required 
precise components, unusual materials, sensitive 
decisions regarding a site, and exacting construction 
standards. Not least of these complicating factors 
was Albers's death, as this was the artist's only large- 
scale project not commissioned by an architect. iS 

The Stanford Wall is a two-sided, freestanding 
planar-relief sculpture, completely independent of 
architecture except that it is a wall (figs. 16, 17). The

work is nearly nine feet high, fifty-four feet long and 
a very narrow one foot wide. One side is composed 
of black, gloss-plated steel rods affixed in rhythmic 
sequence to the mortar courses of a white brick wall; 
the other consists of sheets of black African granite 
to which Albers attached a series of four stainless- 
steel Constellations. It is immediately evident that 
the Stanford Wall encapsulates Albers's previous art- 
in-architecture projects: the brick murals, the 
"skyscraper" style and the stainless-steel Constella- 
tions are all present in this work. 

But if the Stanford Wall serves as a summary 
statement of Albers's graphic art as translated to 
large scale, it marks several firsts in the artist's oeuvre 
which are ultimately more significant. Most obvious 
is the freestanding planar-relief format, which has 
no precedent in Albers's work and only a few in 
modern sculpture. It is this format which allows his 
designs to interact fully and sculpturally with natural 
light (the wall is seen to best advantage at noon, 
when the sunlight causes the horizontal bars to defy 
their form and cast long vertical shadows down the 
white brick face). This was also the first occasion 
on which Albers worked without a commission, as 
he donated the design to Stanford with the under- 
standing that the university would fund, construct 
and maintain the sculpture. His drawings were, in 
fact, rendered by the architect Craig Ellwood, and 
following the artist's death, another architect, Robert 
Middlestadt, supervised the project for Stanford. In 
a very real sense, the architects were now working 
for the artist. 

A word must be said as well about the design. Albers's 
art-in-architecture works were always site-specific — 
they were conceived and developed in response to 
the nature and proportions of the space and mate- 
rials available to him. At Stanford Albers was tree 
to design as he pleased, and the complex graphic 
language which he selected suggests a theme of 
constant evolution and flux within a carefully 
considered discipline. This is particularly true of the 
four Constellations, in which rigorously cir- 



cumscribed spatial relations on the left give way to 
the most fleeting interaction, as the paired figures 
on the right are joined by only a single linear element. 
Although the Constellations had assumed emble- 
matic character in Miinster and Sydney on the basis 
of their public prominence and scale, the Stanford 
project was the first occasion on which Albers, at 
the very end of his life, was able to reflect on the 
relentless passage of time and the fragile existence 
of humanity in the universe. 

Though not Albers's central achievement — the 
Homage to the Square series must be accorded its 
due — the art-in-architecture work is an essential 
element in the artist's portfolio. Indeed, it is signifi- 
cant that on only three occasions did he employ his 
Homages in architectural settings, perhaps in the 
belief that the graphic work was underappreciated 
by his public. More important were Albers's assump- 
tion of the new challenges which the art-in-architec- 
ture projects afforded him late in life, and his growth 
beyond the dictates and decisions of others into an 
artist possessing full confidence in his work at 
monumental scale.
