The Art of Jan Groth 



Carter Ratcliff 



"My art is about silence and about light' 
Jan Groth, 1986 



Born in Stavanger, a city on the west coast of Norway, Jan Groth traveled to Denmark for his training 
in art. The year was 1956 and Groth was eighteen. Though he successfully completed a preparatory 
course at the Royal Academy of Art, Copenhagen, he did not matriculate the following season. Groth's 
interest was in abstract art; the Academy offered only courses in figurative painting and sculpture. For 
the next two years, he studied at private schools, dividing this period about equally between instruction 
in abstract design and traditional training — "extremely traditional," he says. "It was the 1950s and we 
were still being taught to make life drawings and proper renderings from plaster casts of statues." 

Groth found his experiments with abstract painting less tedious but equally unsatisfactory. "I found 
that paint is too wet for me, too fluid. It doesn't give the hand any direction." Crayon felt different. Dry 
and subtly resistant, it imposed welcome restrictions on the artist's hand. "I felt I needed that dryness, 
that sense of guidance." For nearly three decades, Groth has worked with crayon on paper. All his images 
originate in that medium, then they migrate to tapestry, the art form that occupies the center of his oeuvre. 

To weave is to work within the rigidly rectilinear pattern imposed by warp and woof. "Tapestry had 
all the restrictions I felt I needed," Groth recalls. "And of course I knew about weaving. There is nothing 
exotic about working at a loom in Norway, where a folk tradition has handed down the technique from 
the medieval period. But folk weaving wasn't quite what I wanted." By i960 Groth had found his way 
to a tapestry workshop in Amsterdam called de Uil (the Owl), directed by a Dane named Benedikte 
Herlufsdatter. She and Groth were later married. Having been trained at the Aubusson studios, Benedikte 
Groth was able to instruct Jan in the most refined methods of making tapestries. This made it possible 
for him to abandon painting without any qualms. He found that his new medium was as rich as paint 
on canvas, yet contained its possibilities within a strict order, a highly disciplined method. 

Over the past two decades, Groth has aspired to give tapestry the stature of major painting and 
sculpture in the modernist tradition. Among the most important works in this exhibition is a tapestry 
begun in 1982 and completed the following year (cat. no. 3). It is just over five feet high and an inch 
short of fourteen feet long — a magnitude and a sweeping, horizontal format often encountered in the 
most ambitious painting of the postwar era. Groth has transferred those ambitions from canvas to the 
woven field. 

For all their pictorial strength, Groth's tapestries have the presence of objects — and weighty objects, 
at that, their surface textures dense. These dark fields are not only pictures into which we look: they are

presences in the gallery with us. Yet, despite their undeniable physicality, Groth's tapestries engage us 
with subtle modulations, not with visual aggression. If certain of his works must be considered theatrical 
simply because of their large size, then it must be said that he has created a theater of nuance. For affinities, 
one could look to such painters as Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly. 

Groth uses line to measure off a potentially infinite field, as does Martin, though she carries out her 
measurements with regular, gridded patterns. By contrast, Groth sends far fewer lines into the pictorial 
field — sometimes only one — and lets each be inflected by a singular impulse. The individuality - with which 
Groth endows each line recalls the painting of Cy Twombly at its most restrained. Twombly veers between 
extremes of overstatement and understatement. Only when he tends in the latter direction do his refine- 
ments remind one of Groth's, and even then Twombly's images display a greater degree of Expressionist 
agitation. As Groth says, his is an art of "silence," which in less metaphorical terms might be considered 
a visual reticence that leads the subtleties of his images to the verge of the invisible. 

Groth weaves his image into the surface — or, the image is the surface. The rich brownish black of 
Sign, 1983—84 (cat. no. 5) draws the eye into the weave of the field, into the white rift that reaches down 
from the upper right hand corner of the tapestry, cleaving its darkness. The eye feels a faint disquiet, 
unable to decide whether it has encountered an object or an image. And the streak of white offers am- 
biguities of its own. Does it skim along the surface of the black field or indicate a deep rift? Or are we 
to read the black as atmosphere, a dense void, illuminated for a frozen instant along a surging, diagonal 
path? 

The modernist tradition began when artists insisted on their right to present the audience with questions 
of that sort. Permitting no final answer, such questions leave us acutely aware of our perceptions and 
the workings of our imaginations. Groth completed his first tapestry in 1 96 1 . It shows a cluster of curving 
lines against a white field — an image of the kind that fills the paintings and drawings he made as a student. 
Like all his woven pieces of the early sixties, this one looks like a translation from another medium, yet 
Groth is right to say that "My mature work begins with the first tapestry." Working at the loom, Groth 
sensed the possibility of a silence impossible for him to achieve in painting, which records so accurately 
each nuance of the brush. He preferred the impersonality of the weaver's process, which puts even the 
most idiosyncratic image at a remove from the artist. The task, then, was to find images that could survive 
this distancing process, survive and even benefit from it. 

Some of the early, white tapestries have a yellowish or pinkish cast (see fig. 1 ). Sometimes their dark 
tangles of line show accents of red, brown and yellow. Though his early tapestries include experiments 
with linen, Groth preferred wool on a cotton warp, as he still does. By the mid-1960s he had achieved 
his present high level of technical mastery.

Weaving begins once Groth has prepared a working drawing, to indicate the shape and position of 
the figure. The drawing must show which portions of the figure to weave in a solid hue and which to 
mix with the color of the field. Since no drawing can correspond exactly to a woven pattern, a degree 
of interpretation is required if the results are to show where the artist intended a line to grow faint and 
shade off into the surrounding field. Benedikte is "a key figure in my art," says Groth. "Without her, 
there would be no tapestries. We execute them together," says Groth, "because she knows as well as I 
do, sometimes better, how to go from a drawing to a woven pattern. As the one who develops a working 
drawing from my own design, I am like the composer, the one who writes the score. Benedikte is the 



11 



musician who plays the score. When I'm at the loom, I am also in the musician's role, though I work 
more intuitively. I follow my original intention as closely as I follow the working drawing. Perhaps more 
closely." 

Weaving is labor in a way that painting is not. All forms of work encourage a clarity of purpose and 
action. As Groth mastered the techniques of weaving, he began to endow his images with a greater 
austerity. The discipline of his craft had led him to a more disciplined art. And Groth began to admire 
other artists whose processes require work in the ordinary sense of the word — the French sculptor Alain 
Kirili, for instance, who employs the blacksmith's traditional methods. 

Groth made his first black tapestry in 1966 (fig. 2.). Dark form on a light field, so familiar from 
traditional drawing, was suddenly reversed. This change to light on dark left Groth's style untouched 
or, if anything, intensified its most powerful traits. The earliest of his black works send delicate yet 
resilient lines into a pictorial void. Now that the void had turned dark, Groth's new, white line grew 
stronger and at the same time more economical, as if it could survive the void only with the help of a 
greater subtlety. The void changed, as well. 

In Groth's white tapestries, the field often reads simply as an absence — the zone of nonform that 
permits positive form to become visible. Now, darkened with a blend of black and deep brown, the field 
began to count as form in its own right. To borrow a word from the artist, the black tapestries have 
more "presence" than the earlier ones. They take on a visual weight, a density for the eye in keeping 
with their physical weight. 

In 19^0, on his first visit to New York, Groth had a chance to see painting and sculpture he had 
known, until then, only through reproductions. He was particularly interested in Isamu Noguchi's 
sculpture from the late 1950s and early 1960s — three-dimensional volumes pierced by oval openings. A 
device made familiar by nonobjective sculptors of the 1920s (Naum Gabo, Antoine Pevsner and others), 
these voids appear in certain of Henry Moore's monumental figures. Known as "negative spaces," such 
openings permit a sculptural mass to engage its surroundings more intimately than a monolithic form is 
able to do. Groth felt that Noguchi charged his negative space with a delicacy often lacking in the work 
of other sculptors. That quality attracted him, but, more important, it seemed to form some link between 
his art and Noguchi's. 

Groth makes a distinction between influences and what he calls "confirmations," works of art that 
offer parallels to his own interests. Though they may even resemble his own work in some way, the latter 
did not come to his attention until after he had securely established his own direction. The reticence of 
Giorgio Morandi's still lifes, the extreme economies of Alberto Giacometti's late figures — Groth counts 
these among his major influences. Noguchi's handling of negative space, which Groth sees as "drastic

in its subtlety," belongs among the confirmations the Norwegian artist has found in twentieth-century 
art (see fig. 3). "I didn't see Noguchi's work until it was too late to influence me," Groth recalls, "but I 
was very impressed by a certain meditative quality. I began to see his use of negative space as an encourag- 
ing counterpart to the way I had been using the blank areas, the voids, in my tapestries." 

Groth understood the way Noguchi's forms could mold space without having to occupy it: line and 
plane could be effective by implication, so to speak. Since each of his woven lines sends a charge of visual 
energy through an immense black field, Groth's exposure to Noguchi's art led him to refer to that darkness 
as negative space. But the analogy between sculpture and his two-dimensional art is as complex as it is 
evocative. It might be better to say that Groth's line turns the field into a play of negative forms; no 
longer mere emptiness, the dark is a void shaped by the white that streaks or, in some tapestries, slowly 
twists through it. Like Noguchi, Groth molds space by implication, though of course his is the imaginary 
space of pictorial art, not the actual space of the sculptor.

The year after Groth's first trip to New York, one of the city's gallery owners, Betty Parsons, saw his 
work at Copenhagen's Kunstindustrimuseum. Impressed by Groth's tapestries, Parsons arranged to meet 
the artist and, as it turned out, to offer him a show in her gallery during the 1972 season. That same 
year, Groth exhibited tapestries and drawings at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and at Pittsburgh's 
Carnegie Institute. With The Art Institute of Chicago offering Groth yet another one-man show the 
following year, it began to look as if a practitioner of an ancient craft had arrived from the northern 
edge of Europe, Scandinavia, to find a place on the American art-scene. However, by 1980 Groth had 
also exhibited his work in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Great Britain. He was now recognized 
as a member of the modernist tradition that transcends national boundaries. 

Such figures always display signs of their origins. An international reputation never comes to an artist 
practicing a homeless, "international" style. Instead, certain artists enrich whatever is local, even idiosyn- 
cratic in their work, until audiences on both sides of the Atlantic feel compelled to grant their attention. 
In Groth's case, this has meant transforming his own — and Scandinavia's — characteristic reticence into 
a principle of visual economy. He has made habitual understatement a means to visual grandeur. 

As critics and historians have long noted, we are more likely to find open stretches of sea, sky or 
topography in the painting of Northern Europe than, for example, in the painting of the Italian Baroque 
or the French Rococo. Furthermore, the openness of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting or 
the drift toward the void that we see in certain canvases by English Romantics of the nineteenth century 
finds a counterpart in the allover imagery of such pioneers of the New York School as Jackson Pollock, 
Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko. Speaking generally, one might say that Jan Groth was welcomed 
in New York as an inheritor of a Northern European pictorial tradition with strong affinities to postwar 
American painting. Fortunately, though, we needn't confine ourselves to generalities. It is possible to 
speak with precision about at least some of the sources of the reticence, the economy and the openness 
that Groth has carried to such extremes. 

In recent years, the luminously expansive canvases of Caspar David Friedrich have become well-known. 
J. C. Dahl, a Norwegian colleague who settled in Friedrich's native Dresden, has also been accorded a 
notable place among the cultural currents we label Romantic. But Peder Balke, a fellow Norwegian who 
studied with Dahl in Dresden during the 1830s, is still almost entirely unknown beyond the borders of 
his country. Most of Balke's paintings are in Scandinavia, where, from an early age, Jan Groth remembers 
seeing them on museum visits with his family. Balke's visionary landscapes, he says, have been a major 
influence on his art — perhaps the most important of all (see fig. 4). 

The blue glow of Balke's skies draws the color from earth and the sea, turning trees and outcroppings 
of rock into pale silhouettes. Ships and the occasional sign of life on land — a fragile bridge or the rudiments

of a pier — look ghostly. When the sky darkens, Balke guides his palette toward grays and ochers. Some 
of his pictures of stormy seas are nearly monochromatic. Groth says that Balke "concentrates," meaning 
that the earlier artist gathers immense significance into delicate, sometimes nearly unseeable nuances of 
form and tone. Groth admires a comparable subtler)' in certain of Noguchi's sculptures. 

There are no significant links, historical or stylistic, between a Northern Romantic like Peder Balke 
and a twentieth-century avant-gardist like Isamu Noguchi. The point of mentioning them together is to 
suggest Groth's ability to look beyond the narrow boundaries of his local heritage, to reimagine his 
possibilities at every stage of his career. This process did not generate a rapid evolution in Groth's style, 
nor, one could argue, a slow evolution. Instead, his vision of the past — the history of art that he has 
devised for his personal use — has guided him as he sought to concentrate his own imagery, to give it that 
paradoxical blend of openness and density he sensed as a child in the paintings of Peder Balke. Groth's 
art doesn't evolve so much as it finds ways to reveal ever more directly its original premises. 



16 



Visiting New York nearly every year during the early 1970s, Groth was especially impressed by art 
that we now label Minimalist. But Groth was already thirty-two years old by the time he first made 
contact with the art world of Manhattan. Peder Balke aside, he had already felt other influences, found 
other confirmations. In 1967 Groth met two figures who had the aura of legends in the art circles of 
Copenhagen, Ernest and Sonja Ferlov Mancoba (see fig. 5). A Danish sculptor affiliated with the COBRA 
group, she died in 1984 at the age of seventy-three. He is a South African sculptor, still living and working 
in Paris, where he and Sonja had had a studio near Giacometti in the postwar years. Groth calls them 
"my teachers." Though neither found lasting acceptance for their art until late in their lives, they main- 
tained an idealism Groth found deeply impressive. Sonja Mancoba's attitude toward her work was espe- 
cially important to the younger artist, who admired the continuity that led her from one sculpture to the 
next and gave her entire oeuvre the wholeness of a single project.

share with Morandi and Giacometti. "The play of physical light on Giacometti's later, thin forms" meant 
much to Groth, who sees that elusive flicker as a way of turning metal, ordinary matter, into a kind of 
gesture — the record of a thought, an intention. "And some of Henri Michaux's drawings showed me 
that line could simply be itself — display a certain character. Michaux's handling of space wasn't so impor- 
tant, only his sensibility, which he transferred to a minute play of lines, a texture [see fig. 6]." Of Norway's 
contemporary artists, 01av Stromme was among the few with whom Groth felt an affinity. Stromme, 
who died in 1978, belonged to an earlier generation, yet his late paintings approached Groth's tapestries 
in their economy of visual means. 

Groth says, "I am not a member of any generation. I overlap in all directions." Though he came to 
New York often in the seventies, and now lives here for long stretches of time, Groth does not feel he is 
becoming a New Yorker. He still considers himself a European, though he adds, "I always thought it 
would be important to put Europe — my European background — in contrast with America. Not that 
they're so different. It's always a matter of nuances. But, for instance, I had never seen anything quite

like those barrel-shaped fiberglas sculptures of Eva Hesse's, which The Museum of Modern Art showed 
in 1970. They had color and no color at the same time." He sees a similar quietude — and tension — in 
certain of Bailee's paintings and in winter scenes by the seventeenth-century Dutch landscapist Hendrik 
Avercamp. "I like Avercamp's palette — just white," says Groth, "all the variety he gets from ice and 
snow, those pale tones that lead the eye to the horizon, the single, taut line that divides the canvas with 
one simple gesture." 

Hesse's L-shaped sculptures of roughly wrapped fiberglas confirmed Groth's feeling that refinement 
of line could survive in large works of art (see fig. 7). Nuance did not, for its own protection, need to be

confined to drawing and other intimate formats. And there were other confirmations — in the monumental 
linearity of Barnett Newman's Here /, and in the tenuous, always threatened line established during a 
dance choreographed by Trisha Brown and performed by her company in 1 9-6 (see fig. 8). Called Sticks, 
the piece required each dancer to lie on the floor, holding a stick end to end with two other sticks while 
they moved their bodies around the line they had constructed. Groth appreciated the formal resemblance 
between those sticks and the slightly wobbly lines in his drawings and tapestries, but more than that he 
sensed in Trisha Brown's choreography an intention similar to his own — a wish to acknowledge the 
tenuous quality of the line while struggling to overcome it, to make the line strong. In the course of that 
struggle, (.roth saw the space around the line defined. 



Groth also felt a confirmation of his own interests in the denser patterns of Michael Singer's sculpture, 
built from stone and long, limber strips of wood; in the fields of sound intricately woven by the serial 
music of Philip Glass and Steve Reich; and in the irregularities that the German sculptor Ulrich Riickriem 
permits to appear in the midst of his rigidly geometric treatment of stone slabs (see fig. 9). "Ruckriem's 
regularities are less interesting to me than his occasional informality, the way he forces granite to accept 
the inflections of his hand. No melodrama about breaking free of the form, only subtleties within the 
form." Despite their obvious differences, the stone carver and the tapestry weaver have one thing in 
common: both must accept from their mediums an obdurate set of givens. To impose an individual 
intention requires a disciplined patience. 

In 1969, three years after he made his first black tapestry, Groth made his last white one (fig. 10). 
He had exorcised the ghost of painting from his art, and this freed his woven line for economies even 
more severe than he had already achieved. No trace of the painting's self-absorption in its own processes

remained. Nuances of his touch naturally persisted — as they still persist — in Groth's drawings, yet he 
was putting more emphasis on the physical qualities of the oil-stick line. Less and less did Groth rely on 
traditional signs of expressiveness. As in his tapestries, so in his drawings: feeling is concentrated in the 
texture of the material. Drawing on smooth paper, Groth challenges himself to bring out its texture, its 
elusive weave. Though his art is not in any sense Minimalist, Groth learned much from that American 
art movement's insistence on stressing the immediate physicality of the art object. 

Though it's convenient to call Groth's later tapestries black, a closeup look easily makes out their 
mixture of dark brown and black. From a distance, the eye perceives only the mixture's richness. "Without 
any brown," Groth points out, "the black would look gray. Light would bounce off it. The brown is 



needed to absorb light, to give the field luminosity." And these dark fields look more luminous than 
Groth's white tapestries — a paradox, until we recall that simple physical comparisons are beside the 
point here. In literal fact, a white surface reflects more light than a dark one. But Groth's tapestries do 
not encourage us to stay in the realm of the literal. Their images evoke a space elsewhere, a zone of 
indeterminate scale and enveloping darkness, so the strongest light in his tapestries is, after all, imaginary. 

The strength of Groth's tapestries begins with the play of light against dark, as lines run from edge 
to edge of the woven fields, as they branch out from the center, or send what might be called a cartog- 
rapher's impulse toward the boundary of the field and then back toward its interior. In drawings as well 
as tapestries, Groth's positive forms — his lines — often function as the exploratory path that maps the 
void, turning an undefined field into a precisely shaped negative form. Though he abandoned the white 
field in 1969, the palette of the early tapestries persists in Groth's later work, supplying his lines with 
their repertory of tones, which range from sharp white to decidedly grayish hues. "Those early whites," 
says Groth, "became the colors the dark hues of the later works had to adjust to." 

In Sign, 1983—84 (cat. no. 5), a tapestry finished in 1984, two lines stand upright near the center of 
the field. Reaching almost, but not quite, to the lower edge of the tapestry, each of these vertical presences 
sends a delicate tendril floating off toward the right. From a distance, the two figures look luminously 
bright — and, if that is how they look, that is what they are. Yet it helps to approach the tapestry closely 
for a moment, so closely that we lose sight of its full expanse. At this range, we see that the artist has 
woven the two forms otSign, 1983-84 from a darkish white — not quite a gray, but a tone far less bright 
than we might have expected. Contrast with the surrounding field gives the lines their brilliance. Noting 
this helps us bear in mind how much weight Groth puts on visual relationships. No form or field in his 
art has any meaning of its own; meaning appears as one element inflects another. 

This, we might think, would inevitably be the case. Don't all works of art generate their significance 
from the interplay of their elements? Most but not all; or, at least it should be observed that Minimalism 
and its aftermath tried to reduce the artwork's internal relationships to extreme simplicity. We've seen 
how powerfully Groth responded to those reductive tactics on his first visits to New York. Yet he never 
attempted to integrate himself into the Minimalist tradition, with its preference for symmetry, seriality 
and the sheer physicality of materials. 

Whether making a drawing on paper or working out a design for a tapestry, Groth's linear forms 
always present in their laconic way some trace of traditional composition — balance and counterbalance, 
visual thesis and antithesis — of the kind that artists in the Minimalist tradition were so intent on banishing. 
Nor has Groth ever followed the Minimalist practice of producing works in series; he intends each of 
his drawings and tapestries to stand independent of the others. When one drawing recalls another, or 



2-3 



there is a close resemblance between a work on paper and a woven image, the viewer has discovered 
evidence of Groth's intuitive evolution, not an indication he has followed a preset pattern in the Minimalist 
manner. By inviting us to see an expansive, imaginary space beyond the weave of his tapestries and the 
surface of his drawing paper, Groth completes the list of his major differences with Minimalists and their 
heirs: they stress the literal; Groth undermines it, as we would expect from this descendant of Peder 
Balke and Northern European Romanticism. 

Since historical and critical commentary of the past decade has noted so many links between Romantic 
landscape painters and the first generation of the New York School, we might expect Groth's imagery 
to find a comfortable place beside the wide-open expanses, the allover fields, of Newman, Rothko and 
their colleagues. Groth's art brings him close to these leaders of postwar American modernism, but he 
does not appear to be completely at home in their vicinity. The New York School's pioneers sought a 
release from the strictures of traditional composition and, more simply, a sense of liberation from the 
edges of the canvas. They wanted the painting's frame to look arbitrary, so that the painting image could 
read as the luminous emblem of infinity. 

Reversed, the first generation's images of the absolutely unbounded became the Minimalists' simple 
facts of absolute — and absolutely clear — containment. Just as Groth stops short of assimilation to a 
Minimalist stance, so he resists the temptation to become a direct descendant of Barnett Newman and 
his contemporaries — painters who invented the "allover field," as their suggestions of infinity are now 
called. Groth acknowledges the possibility of unbounded pictorial space. The depths of his brown-inflected 
expanses of black recede without impediment. Yet each of his distinctive white figures induces fragments 
of infinity to give over their shapelessness, to become forms in response to the forming gestures of the 
white lines, and to accept a place within the edges of a particular work. 

With the arbitrary quality of its edges, an allover field by Barnett Newman or Jackson Pollock can 
have only a contingent relationship with the architectural space in which we see it — and that air of 
contingency, with its hint of unbounded openness, gives such images a portion of their strength. Groth's 
art displays a different kind of strength, which originates in his persistent struggle to embed each of his 
lines, whether light or dark, within its pictorial setting. He cultivates a look of necessity, not contingency, 
and this gives him an interest in joining particular works to particular sites. Designed for a specific setting, 
a tapestry's white line makes a double gesture — one within the imaginary space of the dark field, the 
other within actual space, the realm defined by architectural form (see fig. 1 1). 

Groth's most ambitious commission to date is a stage curtain, 2,100 square feet in area, for Det 
Norske Teatret in Oslo (fig. 1 z). No tapestry can attain that size, so this project required Groth to reinvent 
his technique. In place of a single expanse of tapestry there are twelve sections of heavy cotton duck.

After a team of assistants embroidered the white line on its surface, the curtain was sewn together by a 
sailmaker. Once in place, the line — stitched in mercerized, reflective cotton thread — draws the attention 
to the front of the theater, then guides the eye in a grand sweep from the upper left-hand corner of the 
space, down toward the stage, then up again — an immensely theatrical gesture. Yet, as always, Groth 
has been tactful. For all its power, this stage curtain presents an introduction to the theatrical spirit, not 
an attempt to upstage the subsequent performance. 

Groth has raised the quality of tact to a major aesthetic trait. One sees why Giorgio Morandi, Alberto 
Giacometti and Henri Michaux have been so important to him. Yet those European heroes could not 
have taught Groth how to come to such impressive terms with traditions of postwar American art. To 
have found, on the one hand, a few strong influences and so many heartening confirmations among the 
artists of the New York scene, and, on the other, to have remained independent, required much self-con- 
fidence and an even higher degree of tolerant openness. Groth has rewritten modernist history on his 
own terms, giving it a specifically Norwegian plot, one that leads us back to the still center where his 
images originate. 

When Groth draws, he begins near the midpoint of the paper sheet. Line appears as vision seeks the 
boundaries of its pictorial realm. This is an imaginary quest carried out with bodily gestures in actual 
space. Like all works of art (even the literalist sculptures of the Minimalists), Groth's drawings initiate 
at the outset a tension between the actual and the Active. Whether dense or feathery, the mark of Groth's 
crayon is always palpably, indubitably there before one's eyes. Yet metaphor intervenes early. At its 
densest, the inscribed mark is "organic, like wet earth," the artist points out. And so are the dark fields 
of his tapestries, if we overlook for a moment the seething, atmospheric nature of their weave. 

Metaphor alternates with metaphor, meanings accumulate, and sometimes seem to vanish. Is a line 
to be read as the boundary of a negative form, field turned into figure, or as a form in its own right? 
Hesitating over such questions, the eye can lose track of Groth's imagery. But not for long. Though he 
says, "My art is a balance between almost something and almost nothing," his intention is always present. 
The tactful balance of extremes in Groth's art generates luminosity out of darkness, silence out of gran- 
diloquent gestures. Sensual and dramatic, his images refuse to become spectacular, to overwhelm. No 
matter how large, the imagination finds them approachable. 

Having approached and entered an image, we read Groth's lines as metaphors of the artist's active 
being, which he invites us to see as comparable to our own. The field is the ground, emotional and 
imaginative, from which action arises. Groth's works encourage us to sense his presence in them. Then, 
as the viewer moves in imagination past the boundaries of his own individuality, he identifies with 
the artist. "I think," Groth says, "that it is possible for people to make identifications through objects, 



2.7 



to sense through my art my feeling of heing, of life. This is not an extroverted process, obviously. It takes 
place on some inner level. But I am convinced it takes place. Confronted by my work, by the feelings I 
express in the work, the viewer's sense of self will be expanded." 

Groth's aesthetic, which defines art as the medium of emotional communication, of immediate exis- 
tential contact, belongs to Expressionism. Having responded to sources ranging from Romanticism to 
Minimalism, he has assimilated and reinvented them all. The results have made him a figure central to 
the development of the Expressionist impulse in postwar European art. Expressionists tend to be overbear- 
ing. Groth is the opposite, an Expressionist of silence and of light, of that ultimate inwardness where all 
our emotions, even the most violent, must originate.

March 1986.
