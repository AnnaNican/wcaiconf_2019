The genuine collector is a rare being. He is the pioneer who assembles 
a collection on the basis of his taste and knowledge. While he diligently 
pursues a well chartered course others spend time and mottey in pursuit 
of the latest art fad. 

In art Belacroix believed Painting to be the most difficult medium. I 
choose to believe he meant not only difficult of execution but also of 
comprehension. This belief is substantiated by the fact that a far greater 
number of people prefer IHusic and Poetry to Painting. 

In trying to analyze the reason for this preference I have concluded that 
whereas Music and Poetry employ only one's emotional sensibilities — 
Painting reiinircs the use of your emotional mechanisnt and also your 
faculty of comprehension. 

As a ctmsequence I believe tme's capacity for enjoyment of Painting 
and Sculpture is commensurate with the power to observe and emotion- 
ally absorb the image thus created. 

To the esthetic there is little connection between the price tag and the 
art object. In a recent London Sales Room $616,000 was paid for a paint- 
ing by Cezanne. In commenting on this, too few mention the merits of 
the painting. To the majority only the sales price seems important. When 
ashed if it were possible that the selling price represented the paint- 
ing's true value, I could without hesitation assure the interrogator that 
such was indeed the case. The price paid represented the worth the 
buyer — not the seller — placed on the object. There are many who have 
$616,000, but there is but one who possesses this marvelous painting by 
Cezanne. 

It has been my experience that in purchasing works of art the buyer is 
inevitably the one who gains. The seller receives payment hut mice. The 
purchaser however collects a daily spiritual dividend that goes hand 
in hand with ownership of great art. The joy of possessing it contains a 
special uplifting ingredient that permits the possessor to live in an 
aura reserved for the Saints. It also gains for him a special niche in the 
hearts and esteem of those with whom he daily rubs elbows. In my opin- 
ion such a feeling of well-being cannot be derived through possessing a 
large bank balance. 



Proof of the intangible value of good art can be gained by considering 
that although its component parts tnay be of no material value, art trea- 
sures nevertheless are usually the first thing sought by an invading army. 

i have often been ashed why I purchased this or that object or why I 
chose to buy the worh of one artist in preference to another. These are 
in reality not easy questions. Reduced to their simplest form I should say 
it resolves itself largely into a matter of personal taste. Availability is 
also a hey factor in collecting. 

The true uiorth of an art object, as that of a Musical composition or Poent, 
is often not readily recognizable. This is where taste and experience 
play an all important role in the formation of a collection. During the 
early years of collecting and observing I classified art as abstract or 
realistic. And by Schools such as Dada or Surrealist. Today I recognize 
but two kinds of art. Good Art and Bad Art. 

in the formation of a collection I had no desire to tnvn a painting b;/ each 
of the better known Contemporary artists. By choice I confined my activi- 
ties to a small group. Within this group my collection often contained 
40 to 50 works by a single artist. In several instances this figure ex- 
ceeded 100. 

It was my belief that since I could own — and perhaps more important 
— absorb the significance of — but a limited amount of art it was better 
that I restrict my endeavors. It seemed much more desirable to own and 



be thoroughly ctmversant tcith a comprehensive group of worU by one 
artist than to possess individual works by a great number of artists. 
This ot course was a matter of personal choice. 

Through the collection hanging at "Stone's Throw" I was able to demon- 
strate the merits of this approach in collecting contemporary art. Here 
I continuously had on exhibit more than two hundred works of art. This 
nuntber did not include various group-hangings of work by one artist. 
It was my belief that the total esthetic impact of the more than two 
hundred on exhibit failed to equal that of say a wall devoted to showing 
the complete range of Schwitter's work. Or a gallery devoted solely to the 
work of one artist such as Klee, Giacometti, Leger,Burrt, Fautrier, Du- 
butfet, Sta'el or Picasso. 

This method of grouping for display permitted the viewer an oppor- 
tunity to make a more accurate appraisal of the individual artist's work 
than seeing the same material scattered throughout the collection. It 
had a further aspect of interest, that of seeing the individuals' work 
against a baekgrotind of numerous works by his contemporaries. 

Exercising your prerogative as to what you buy and how you display 
it is an important part of the joy of collecting. There is fortunately room 
for all tastes in today's exciting world of art. I wish it were possible 
for me to do it all over again. 

G. David Thompson, "Stone's Throw", Pittsburgh, Pa. 



The President and the Board of Trustees of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation 
welcome the opportunity of presenting one hundred paintings selected from the 
G. David Thompson Collection. 

We are grateful to the Municipal Museum at The Hague — one of three European 
museums which featured the collection — for facilitating the preparatory steps for 
the current exhibition, and to the Galerie Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, for cooperat- 
ing with the Museum staff in arranging the loan show. 

Through its uncompromising commitment to quality, the collection itself is a tribute 
to G. David Thompson.
