The exchange of a large group of modern paintings between Xeir York and 
Philadelphia is an item of unique importance. To New Yorkers the fame of 
the combined Gallatin and Arensberg Collections is well-known. In turn, 
the riches of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection in Xew York have long 
been a lure for Philadelphians, pointed up especially in recent months by the 
added interest of the new installation in the Frank Lloyd Wright museum. 
While the distance between the two museums is a bare two hours there are 
obviously many people in both cities who cannot sacrifice even that short 
time to travel back and forth. The admirable purpose of this exchange is 
therefore to overcome this impediment and one is tempted to add that in 
both cases the mountain is thus "brought to Mohammed." 

The collection of A. E. Gallatin came to Philadelphia in 1943. Gallatin had 
long been a collector of books and paintings, but it was during the Twenties 
and Thirties that he concentrated on the School of Paris which today forms 
the main strength of his collection. He went every year to Europe spending 
many months in Paris, where he assiduously combed the galleries on both 
banks of the Seine and soon became intimate with the most creative minds 
in painting and sculpture. Be went often to the artists' studios and being an 
amateur photographer made a series of incisive portraits of all the leading 
figures. 

Albert Eugene, or Eugene as he was called by his friends, was also a painter 
in his own right. He was thus possessed of an "eye'" which, added to his 
exquisite taste and complete abhorrence of the second-rate, admirably fitted 
him to be the gentleman collector par excellence. While never forced to 
starve in a garret, he was not in any sense a Maecenas, it is true that he and 
some of his New York friends were dubbed "The Park Avenue Cubists" but 
this was said with respect and admiration. He bought at low prices because 
he had the wisdom and imagination to gauge the future, liven so the purchase 
of his two large paintings, the Three Musicians of Picasso and Leger's La 
Vllle, was done at considerable sacrifice, but it was not long before he was 
rewarded bg both acquisitions becoming "news" in art annals. 

When Gallatin's collection grew too large for his apartment he lent it to 
Xew York University where it was known as The Gallery of Living Art. 
Eventually realizing that the ever-growing collection should be more per- 
manently housed, he studied the suggestion of Fiske Kimball that it be given 
to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although strictly a Xew Yorker, Gallatin 
had been born on Philadelphia's Main Line at Villanova. While not perhaps 
exactly harking back to a log cabin, Albert Eugene thought it most appro- 
priate that he should remember his birthplace and it was thus that the 
collection arrived in Philadelphia in 1943. The transition and installation 
fortunately occurred during his lifetime, so that he had the satisfaction of 
seeing the ultimate disposal of his favorite objects while the museum bene- 
fited greatly by his knowledge and ever self-effacing suggestions. 



The formation of the Arensberg Collection covered a longer span of years. 
In their early married life Mr. and Mrs. Arensberg lived in New York and, 
both being keenly interested in art, found themselves in the forefront of all 
the avant-garde movements. The Armory Show in 1913 gave added impetus 
to their collecting and their proximity to the modern movement in the im- 
mediate years that followed had much to do with their emphasis on acquir- 
ing works of that decade. Their many Cubist paintings by Picasso, Juan Gris 
and Braque attest to this fact. Then too, their early admiration for Marcel 
Duehamp proved not only the beginning of a lifelong friendship but also 
gave them the opportunity to acquire the main body of his most important 
work. Among these were not only the famous Nude Descending A Staircase 
but also the Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, better known as 
the Large Glass, which Duehamp himself considers his most important crea- 
tion. When the Arensbergs decided to leave New York and live in California 
they feared the Large Glass was too fragile to move so far and gave it to their 
friend Katherine Dreier, another pioneer collector. Their fears proved right 
for even in this short move the glass suffered seriously, developing long star- 
like cracks. Duehamp, however, turned this near disaster into a happy acci- 
dent by declaring that the cracks added greatly to his original composition. 
On her death, Miss Dreier willed the Large Glass to Philadelphia where it 
rightly returned again to form part of the Arensberg Collection. 

The years in Bollywood were ones of more and more acquisitions as well as 
years of intense study. For Walter Arensberg had a second great interest in 
his efforts to discover the identity of the true Shakespeare, a lifelong oc- 
cupation in itself and one which resulted in many articles explaining his 
very personal theories. The Arensberg house became the centre of the intel- 
ligentsia, especially in the War years when many Europeans came to live 
in Bollywood. Their hospitality was boundless and everyone interested in 
contemporary art was given a royal welcome. It was during this period that 



the Arcnsbergs fell under the spell of Pre-Columbian sculpture and bought 
many important pieces which they delighted in mingling with their School 
of Paris paintings. A jade mask from Teotihuacdn or an Aztec feathered 
serpent would find itself between a Picasso and a Klee, while in the garden 
at night a visitor might look down on the lights of Hollywood over a large 
stone conch from Vera Crux. 

When the Arensbergs decided to look about for a museum capable of con- 
taining the many elements of their collection they at first hoped it would 
remain on the West Coast. Since this proved impossible to realise they con- 
sidered several cities, ending with Philadelphia. Here the collection found 
its permanent home (1950-1952) next to the Gallatin Collection. The Phila- 
delphia Museum of Art was originally called after the state, the Pennsyl- 
vania Museum of Art. By happy chance Walter Arensberg had been born 
in Pittsburgh and so, like Gallatin, in finally choosing Philadelphia, he also 
proved himself a loyal son of his native state. In this happy outcome Fiske 
Kimball and his wife Marie played a major role. 

While New York is undoubtedly seeing the "cream" of the paintings it mast 
be remembered that there still remains the large body of sculpture from 
both collections which would have been complicated to displace. This in- 
cludes the greatest single group of Brancusi's work on view anywhere in the 
world, the entire collection of Pre-Columbian sculpture and of necessity 
Duchamp's Large Glass. It is therefore hoped that this New York showing 
will prove the aperitif which will urge visitors to come to Philadelphia 
where they will enjoy a full view of the two collections in their complete form 
installed in adjacent galleries and together creating a "Museum within a 
Museum."
