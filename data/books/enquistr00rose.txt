A RETROSPECTIVE 



james rosenquist 



A RETROSPECTIVE 



WALTER HOPPS and SARAH BANCROFT 



Since the late 19505, lames Rosenquist has created in exception il 
and consistently intriguing bod) of work. A leader of the American 
Pop art movement in the 1960s, alone with such contemporaries as 
Jim Dine. Ro&gt; Lichtenstein. Claes Oldenburg, and Andy Warhol. 
Rosenquist drew on the popular iconography of advertising and mass 
media to conjure a sense of contemporary life and the political tenor of 
the times. Born and raised in the Midwest and working in New Yoik 
and Florida, he has developed a distinctK American voice — \ei his 
work comments on popular culture and institutions from a continually 
evolving global perspective. From his early days as a billboard painter 
to his recent masterful use of abstract painting techniques, Rosenquist 
has maintained a passion for visually, color, line and shape that con- 
tinues to dazzle viewers and influence younger generations of artists. 

Published on the occasion of a Comprehensive retrospective 
organized by Walter Hopps and Sarah Bancroft, this monograph is a 
definitive investigation of Rosenquist's more than forty-year career in 
painting and sculpture, source collages, draw ingE and jraphics and 
multiples, from his earliest works to the present. Lavishly illustxansd, 
the book features nearly three hundred of ii most in meant 

works, including several that have never been published and a broad 
selection of source collages. The essay by Hopps pro\ id en iew 

of Rosenquist's career, and those b&gt; |ulia Blaut and Ruth E. Fine- 
reveal his working processes in collage and printmakin ely. 
Texts by Chris Balsiger. Bancroft. Eugene E. Epstein, and Michelle 
Harewood explore selected themes recurring in his work. An exti n 
chronology, including many newly published photographs, examines 
the artist's life and career. Completing the publication ire m exhibition 
history and a selected bibliography, which document the prolific 
activity of this major figure in contemporary American art.

James Rosenquist's The Swimmer in the Econo-mist (1997-98) 
was chc first work commissioned by Deutsche Bank in consulta- 
tion with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for the 
Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. The special affinity arising from 
this cooperation continues between the American artist and 
Deutsche Bank until today: his three-part, monumental paint- 
ning. which has now become a sorely missed artistic feature at 
its usual site in Deutsche Bank London, forms a highlight of the 
current exhibition. Not only this special response to his work, 
but also his exceptional contribution to our program of edi- 
tions— a suit tailored from paper— as well as short films and in- 
terviews for the bank's corporate communication are reflections 
of our special partnership. Consequently, it is with a familiar and 
special pleasure that we sponsor the first comprehensive retro- 
spective of James Rosenquist's art in more than three decades. 

Rosenquist creates his work with paint that he mixes by 
hand and applies with a paintbrush. These techniques may be 
seen as antiquated or old-fashioned in the age of media art. but 
Rosenquist— as demonstrated by his numerous exhibitions and 
successes— continues to challenge his audience with novel and 
remarkable imagery that remains on the vanguard. We believe 
Rosenquist's objective has been to create dynamic artworks, 
which, in intensity of color and size, spatially embrace and emo- 
tionally engage their audience. Yet. Rosenquist's artistic achieve- 
ment fascinates beyond its formal brilliance, as his work reflects 
a critical interest in social and political issues the world over. 



These interests and concerns are realized as thematic leitmotifs 
in his work, culminating in such large-scale paintings as F-UI 
(1964-65); Horse Blinders (1968-69); The Holy Roman Empire 
through Checkpoint Charlie (1994); and The Swimmer in the 
Econo-mist 

It is with pleasure and anticipation that we welcome the 
exhibition lames Rosenquist: A Retrospective, which fully meets 
all our expectations and. I am convinced of this, will continue to 
be compelling to the public as well.

James Rosenquist 



preface 



Since the late 1950s, James Rosenquist has been creating an 
exceptional and consistently intriguing body of work. His oeuvre 
is a clear demonstration of a gifted artist's pursuit of a unique 
aesthetic path that also reveals larger truths about the sur- 
rounding culture. Having grown up in the Midwest and working 
in New York City and Florida over the course of his career, 
Rosenquist has developed a distinctly American voice; yet his is 
a voice that comments upon popular culture and institutions 
from a continually evolving global perspective. James Rosenquist 
A Retrospective reaffirms the artist's status as a premier painter 
From his early days as a commercial artist to his recent master- 
ful use of abstract painting techniques, Rosenquist has engaged 
in a love affair with viscosity and color, line and shape. He leads 
other practitioners of painting into the twenty-first century by 
reasserting the vitality of this venerable medium. 

As a commercial artist painting billboards in the 1950s, 
Rosenquist was witness to and absorbed the advertising media's 
powerful mechanisms of influence. Executing vast advertise- 
ments high above the crossroads of the world in Times Square, 
he learned firsthand how to distinguish the media from the mes- 
sage and how to frame the differences. In 1960, he turned away 
from commercial art and, channeling aspects of that experience, 
focused on his fine-art career. Through shifts in scale and con- 
tent. Rosenquist reformulated photographs and advertising im- 
agery from popular magazines into a kaleidoscope of compelling 
and enigmatic narratives on canvas. These new amalgamations 
are as eye-catching as the flashiest of ads but cast with a distinc- 
tive tone when removed from their source material. His work 
has poignantly registered social and political concerns and re- 
flected upon the dynamics of modern capitalist culture — an on- 
going critique that reached its first zenith with the monumental 
F-lll (1964-65). Superimposing images of consumer products, an 
underwater diver, a doll-faced child, and an atomic explosion 
along the fuselage of an F-lll bomber plane, the work illustrated 
the connection between America's booming postwar economy 
and what President Eisenhower characterized as the military- 
industrial complex. Measuring eighty-six feet in length, it was 



the largest Pop art painting at the time of its debut at the Leo 
Castelli Gallery in New York in the spring of 1965. Already a 
leading player in the American Pop art movement, Rosenquist 
achieved international acclaim when the work subsequently 
toured to several of Europe's most important museums. 

Inspired by the possibility of a new work as far-reaching and 
significant as F-lll. I began talks in 1996 with the artist about a 
commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. In response. 
Rosenquist created the monumental and vibrant three-painting 
suite The Swimmer in the Econo-mist (1997-98). the first work 
commissioned for Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin and a center- 
piece of the collection. Rosenquist's earlier history at the 
Guggenheim Museum stems back to his inclusion in Lawrence 
Alloway's 1963 exhibition Six Painters and the Object, a milestone 
exhibition for Pop art in the United States. His work was also 
featured in Rendezvous: Masterpieces from the Centre Georges 
Pompidou and the Guggenheim Museum, a remarkable exhibition 
drawn from the collections of the Pompidou and Guggenheim 
and hosted by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New 
York from October 1998 to January 1999. We have continued to 
express our commitment to Rosenquist's work with the acquisi- 
tion of his painting Flamingo Capsule (1970), an elegy to America's 
space exploration program. This important mural, which in- 
cludes motifs that reappear in The Swimmer in the Econo-mist, is 
among the works that form the foundation of the Guggenheim 
Museum Bilbao collection. 

Following the success of the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin 
commission, I began to discuss with Rosenquist a plan for a full- 
scale retrospective, which would allow the public to experience 
his remarkable later work within the context of his entire career. 
The artist embraced this idea from the beginning It was agreed 
that Walter Hopps. now Adjunct Senior Curator of Twentieth- 
Century Art at the Guggenheim, and one of the seminal curators 
of twentieth-century art in America, should curate the project. 
Sarah Bancroft, Assistant Curator at the Guggenheim, has collab- 
orated with Hopps in this endeavor, and together as co-curators, 
they have worked in concert with the artist to plan an exhibition 



IX | XXI 



that celebrates Rosenquists achievements across the spectrum 
of more than forty years of artistic production. They have made 
an extremely committed and extraordinary team, and I am grate- 
ful for their tremendous energy and expertise. The exhibition 
could not have happened without the sustained support of 
Donald Saff, who has championed the retrospective in infinite 
ways, helping to maintain the necessary momentum for such a 
large endeavor. It is with great pride and pleasure that we now 
arrive at the moment where James Rosenquist: A Retrospective 
has become a reality. 

The exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum is preceded by its 
presentation in Houston at The Menil Collection and The Museum 
of Fine Arts, Houston. The collaboration between these two 
major cultural institutions in cohosting the exhibition in Houston 
deserves special recognition. I wish to thank my colleagues, James 
Demetrion, Interim Director of The Menil Collection, and Peter 
Marzio, Director of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, for their 
cooperation and support of this exhibition and tour. I am like- 
wise delighted that the exhibition will be hosted in Europe at 
the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and thank Director Juan Ignacio 
Vidarte for his commitment. 

In presenting a comprehensive overview of Rosenquists work 
in painting, sculpture, collage, drawing, and graphics, we celebrate 
his singular achievement while continuing the museum's tradi- 
tion of exhibiting the full range of a major living artist's oeuvre 
in a retrospective format. A presentation of this scale and com- 
plexity could never have been realized without the generosity of 
the private collectors and institutions that have entrusted their 
works to the exhibition. Their names appear elsewhere in this 
volume (except for those who wish to remain anonymous), and 1 
must express my gratitude to them for allowing us to realize 
such a comprehensive undertaking. 

At an historical moment when it has become increasingly 
challenging to sustain sufficient funding for arts programming, I 
am grateful to our global partners Deutsche Bank and Delta Air 
Lines, who together with the National Endowment for the Arts, 
have provided essential sponsorship for this project. We are 



extremely grateful for the opportunity to work once again with 
Deutsche Bank, which under the leadership of Dr. Rolf-E. 
Breuer, Chairman of the Advisory Board. Dr. Josef Ackermann, 
Chairman of the Group Executive Committee, and Dr. Tessen 
von Heydebreck, Member of the Board of Managing Directors, 
together with Dr. Ariane Grigoteit and Friedhelm Hutte has 
maintained its long-standing commitment to excellence and 
innovation in the arts. Deutsche Bank's particular commitment 
to The Swimmer m the Econo-mist has demonstrated a special 
affinity with Rosenquists work. We remain deeply indebted to 
Frederick Reid, President and COO of Delta Air Lines, whose 
consistent and enlightened support of Guggenheim programs 
has allowed us to undertake projects of this magnitude Our 
thanks are also extended to Kelly Sartin and Carter Etherington. 
Delta Air Lines Sponsorship Team, for their creativity and dedi- 
cation. The National Endowment for the Arts also deserves 
particular recognition for financial support that has allowed us 
to realize this important undertaking. 

Finally, I extend my profound thanks to James Rosenquist. 
He and his staff have given a tremendous amount of their time 
and energy, and we are extremely grateful for their unflagging 
commitment and invaluable insight. Rosenquist has also been a 
magnanimous lender to this exhibition; without his generosity 
to and support of the project, we could not have presented the 
full scope of his stellar achievement. 

— Thomas Krens 
Director, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation 



We must recognize at the outset the remarkable spirit of cooper- 
ation and collaboration that this project has engendered since its 
inception. Above all, we wish to thank James Rosenquist for his 
creative spirit and constant cooperation and enthusiasm. His 
family — Mimi Thompson, Lily Rosenquist. and John Rosenquist — 
must also be thanked for their support. Examining the arc of 
Rosenquist's career has been a source of delight and inspiration, 
the same feelings that we anticipate others will share while 
viewing Rosenquist*s work in the exhibition and in the pages of 
this book. Rosenquist never ceased to meet the demands re- 
quired by this project. We are grateful that he opened his 
archives to us and made available the resources of his dedicated 
staff. We sincerely thank these individuals whose commitment to 
the project was a blessing and joy. In Florida, Beverly Coe and 
Cindy Hemstreet provided tireless and always timely efforts to 
meet our requests for information and material; and Kevin 
Hemstreet, William Jacobs, and Daniel Trochio lent their expertise 
from the studio; in Maryland, Michael Harrigan generously 
marshaled his research and records, and cheerfully provided as- 
sistance on more aspects of the exhibition than we can name; and 
in New York. John Spinks assisted with humor and patience. 

The exhibition could not have been conceived and organized 
without the dedicated support of Thomas Krens, Director. 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, and the superb guidance of 
Lisa Dennison, Chief Curator and Deputy Director. We are also 
thankful to Donald Saff for his insight, clarity of vision, and advice. 

A retrospective of this size would be impossible without the 
support and cooperation of lenders from across the globe. These 
private individuals and institutions, listed separately in the cata- 
logue, have generously parted with their works, in many cases 
for an extended tour, with the spirit of cooperation that makes 
possible a comprehensive examination of Rosenquist's career. 
For their generosity, we offer our most heartfelt thanks. 

For courteously allowing us to examine Rosenquist works 
firsthand, we are especially grateful to Ellsworth Kelly and Jack 
Spear. Robert Rauschenberg and David White, and Linda G. 
Singer. Several people were instrumental in helping locate works 



and secure important loans. We would like to express our 
gratitude to Frances Beatty. Edward Boyer, Rosa Essman. 
Richard L. Feigen, Michael Findlay, Bill Goldston. Billy Kliiver 
and Julie Martin, Sharon P. Kridel, Hans Mautner. Bob Monk, 
Ebba Setterblad. Bjorn Wetterling, and James Rosenquist's staff, 
with special thanks to Michael Harrigan. 

We are thankful to our colleagues in archives, galleries, insti- 
tutions, libraries, universities, and museums worldwide for ac- 
commodating a battery of research inquiries, requests for 
materials and fact-finding missions that accompanied our work 
on this project. For their assistance, we would like to thank

living in the Plains, you'd see surreal things; you'd see mi- 
rages. I'm sitting on the front porch, as a little kid at sunset, 
and the sun is in back of me, and walking across the horizon is 
a Trojan horse four stories tall. I go, "Uh-oh — what's that?" So 
I run in the house and say, "Look! Look at the big horse!" It 
was the neighbor's white stallion, which had got loose, caught 
the light in the heat, and it looked four stones tall. These kinds 
of little tiling make. I think, the curiosity, o&gt; the inquisitive- 
ness, that make an artist. — James Rosenquist 1 

lames Rosenquist was born on November 29, 1933, in Grand 
Forks, North Dakota, at the Deaconness Hospital, which later 
became the Happy Dragon Chinese Restaurant. He spent much 
of his childhood in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio, often in 
farming communities, and to this day he refers to himself as a 
farm boy who just happened to become an artist. He keeps a 
tractor on his property in Aripeka, Florida, on the Gulf of Mex- 
ico, and every now and then takes it out to plow up brush — to 
let off steam, but also perhaps as a reminder that, had he not left 
home, he might well have become a farmer himself. 

One of Rosenquist's aunts made marionettes and model air- 
planes with him, and his mother was an amateur painter, whose 
work hung in the house. When he was left to himself as a child, 
he would roll out yards of wallpaper and draw on the white side, 
producing long continuous illustrated stories. His family moved 
to Minneapolis when he was nine, and he visited the Minneapo- 
lis Institute of Arts but was scared off by the mummies in the 
collection. In junior high school, he did a watercolor of a sunset 



and won a scholarship to spend four Saturdays drawing and 
painting at the Institute. "I arrived there," he explains, "and my 
teachers were all World War II vets, who'd studied art on 
the G.I. Bill. They said, Do you ever think of doing anything 
abstract?' I said. 'No.' 'Have you ever heard of nonobjective paint- 
ing 5 ' I said, 'No.' I said. 'I paint as realistically as possible 

It was not until he was eighteen or nineteen that Rosenquist 
encountered serious painting: he hitchhiked from the University 
of Minnesota, where he was a student, to the Art Institute of 
Chicago and was just stunned by what he saw there — works by 
Edgar Degas and Claude Monet, as well as more modern pieces 
by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. At university. Rosenquist 
came under the tutelage of Cameron Booth. A veteran of World 
War I who had studied with Hans Hoffman in Munich. Booth 
was probably the most interesting Abstract Expressionist in the 
Midwest (fig. 9). Rosenquist must have shown talent early on, 
because by 1955 he had won a scholarship to the Art Students 
League in New York. Although the scholarship covered only tu- 
ition. Booth urged Rosenquist to go. 

Rosenquist arrived in Manhattan in September of 1955, got a 
room at the YMCA, and promptly headed off to the Cedar Tav- 
ern, as he purs u see che old guys" — Willem de Kooning, Franz 
Kline, and the other artists of their generation, who were regu- 
lars there. But when he got to the bar "the vibes were terrible." 
The militant black poet LeRoi Jones, who later changed his 
name to Amiri Baraka, was having a dunk and had Just got into 
a terrible argument with Geotge Lincoln Rockwell, the head of 
the American Nazi Party. Only Rosenquist, who has mastered

such extraordinary juxtapositions in his art, could walk into a 
moment like that on one of his first days in New York. 

At the Art Students League. Rosenquist studied with three 
artists of note: George Grosz. from whom he learned a delicate 
touch with color; Edwin Dickinson, an early modernist, and one 
of the most underrecognized figures in American art (fig. 10); 
and Robert Beverly Hale, an interesting artist who taught classi- 
cal drawing and was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art. where he distinguished himself by acquiring works by de 
Kooning, Kline. Jackson Pollock, and others. (Hale bought Pol- 
lock's Autumn Rhythm [1950] for a hundred and twenty-five 
thousand dollars, which was the most money Pollock got for 
anything in his lifetime.) 

To get by financially. Rosenquist worked briefly as a chauf- 
feur and bartender for Roland Stearns, a son of one of the 
founders of Bear Stearns; then he joined the sign painters union 
and found work painting billboards around New York City. The 
craft of handpainting billboards has been virtually forgotten 
today, but at that time it was a primary form of commercial art. 
Rosenquist was born with a natural gift for drawing, and back 
in the Midwest he had worked summers painting signs for 



Phillips 66 and Coca-Cola (fig. Ll). He claims to have learned 
more from his fellow "paint smcarers," as he calls them, than he 
did in art school: how to mix paint, how to draw in the forms, 
how to handle modeling and produce realistic renderings, and 
so on. If you are painting Gregory Peck in a movie billboard, you 
have to make him recognizable from blocks away, even though 
you are working right against the surface, high up on scaffold- 
ing. So you grid it out, and you learn to see what you are doing 
from any distance. Rosenquist quit the business by 1960. after a 
fellow worker died falling from scaffolding, but the experience of 
painting billboards had an enormous influence on his subse- 
quent work. 

What really, really got to me was the idea that, could 1 ever 
do anything like Michelangelo? By that I mean, how do you 
get from being a kid to being someone who could do the 
Sistine Chapel? 

Toward the end of the 1950s, the art world began to divide 
While some of the younger artists in New York and California 
continued in the general realm of Abstract Expressionism, oth- 
ers began to look for new ways to proceed. Soon something 
astounding happened, out of wretched poverty, we got Robert 
Rauschenberg, who then inspired his contemporaries Jasper 
Johns and Cy Twombly. In the next wave of artists, two stood

out: Frank Stella, the hard-core abstract artist whose slogan was 
"What you see is what you see." and Rosenquist. I first visited 
Stella's New York studio around 1959. The room was pitch- 
black, so it was hard to see the black paintings he was doing 
then, but I could see a spotlit piece of crumpled paper nailed to 
the wall. It was a reproduction of a de Kooning. I turned to 
Stella and said, "You must really hate de Kooning's work." After 
he answered, "No, on the contrary, he's a great artist," I asked, 
"Well, what is this?" And he said, "It's to remind me of what I 
must not do." Stella was a very quiet man, and this was almost 
the first conversation 1 had with him. 

In 1958 and 1959, Rosenquist produced his first truly mature 
paintings, which he has called "excavations" (e.g., cat. nos. 1-3). 
He also referred to them as the "wrong-color paintings," be- 
cause they were often made with paint discarded from his com- 
mercial jobs. "I thought, how could 1 make a beautiful, colorful 
painting with these low-value colors?" he explains. The excava- 
tions are delicate, textured works, almost abstract, with small 
strokes in an allover pattern on the canvas. Though they are 
nonobjective, some have faint geometric shapes or lettering in 
them, which wete based on the traces of stairs, other structures, 
and signs that Rosenquist noticed on the sides of buildings while 
he was up in the air working on billboards — the pentimenti ex- 
posed when othet buildings were torn down. 

During his early years in New York, Rosenquist moved 
through a succession of studios. In 1960, he settled into a loft at 
3-5 Coenties Slip, on the East River waterfront in Lower Man- 
hattan, a building where a number of other artists — Robert 
Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, and Jack Youngerman — 
were already living and working. By then, Rosenquist had met 
Johns and Rauschenberg, who had studios nearby, and knew their 
work, he had seen the first show of Rauschenberg's Combines in 
1958 at the Leo Castelli Gallery (which may have included figs. 13 
and 37). Certain aspects of Rosenquist's paintings owe far more 
to Johns and Rauschenberg than to the Pop artists. "Jasper was 
very influential on my work," Rosenquist says. "All the young 
artists around were splashing paint, and then, when I saw what 
Jasper was up to, I thought, you don't have to do that." 

The shift in Rosenquist's work in I960 seems almost inexpli- 
cable. Before he met Roy Lichtenstein or Andy Warhol or saw

what they were up to. he was already making art that was very 
much related to theirs. It is possible that what he had been 
doing in commercial sign painting— working close up with the 
details and creating large images that extended beyond his field 
of vision — suddenly took hold of his imagination in a different 
way. and it occurred to him that he could make paintings that 
had the same kind of energy but were less generic. He started 
cropping images and reconstructing them in unusual ways. 
"1 thought, how can I do a new kind of picture?" he says 1 
thought, If I can take a fragment of something realistic, and put 
the fragment in space at a certain size. I could make a painting 
where people would recognize something at a certain rate of 
speed. The largest fragment would be the closest, and the hard- 
est to recognize. Therefore, 1 could make a mysterious painting." 
Rosenquist has talked about the terror of the bare studio. 
He saw some of the artists around him fixing up their studios, 
painting the walls white, producing pristine empty spaces, and 
he began to wonder whether they would ever have the courage 
to start producing work. He told himself he was not going to fall 
into the same trap, so in order to have something to look at in 
his studio he began collecting, from magazines and other 
sources, advertisements and photographic reproductions that he 
spread out across the floor and pinned up on the walls. He 
arranged them in certain ways, as he tried to decide what he 
was going to paint. Eventually, the clippings were incorporated 
into collages that he made in preparation for the paintings. 

fa 1964, a group of private galleries in Paris decided to have a 
big Surrealist exposition, and they hauled OM every Surrealist 
thing they had. 3m the scale of all these works was really 
cabinet-Size. It was very intimate. All o) the paintings were like 
looking through an aperture, out a window. And I felt com- 
pletely the opposite of that. I wanted my paintings to spill OM 
the front of the canvas in this very impersonal way. 

By 1962, the movement that came to be known as Pop art 
was suddenly very much in evidence. The term "Pop" originated 
in the mid-1950s in England, where it referred first to mass- 
produced products and later to the artworks— featuring imagery

appropriated from advertising and popular culture — made by a 
group of English artists, beginning as early as the late 1940s, with 
Eduardo Paolozzi's collages (fig. 14), and including such works as 
Richard Hamilton's iconic Just what is it that makes today's homes 
so different, so appealing? (1956). Other artists in the British 
movement included Derek Boshier, David Hockney, Allen Jones, 
and an American working in England. R. B Kitaj, and their work 
was full of images from American magazines. (The Hamilton 
work, for instance, shows a Charles Atlas-like figure holding a 
giant Tootsie Pop.) Pop art also turned up in France and Ger- 
many, where it countered the prevailing nonobjective art. In 
France, there were Yves Klein's kitsch objects that he made by 
spray-painting souvenir casts from the Louvre with Interna- 
tional Klein Blue, and Martial Raysse's sculptural works incorpo- 
rating neon lighting (fig. 15). In Germany, there were the collage- 
like paintings of Sigmar Polke (fig. 16) and the grisailles of 
Gerhard Richter. both of whom made extensive use of photo- 
graphic sources. 

The artists most central to the American phase of Pop art 
were Warhol, Lichtenstein, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg, 
Their works are characterized by stylized, emblematic imagery 
that is flat to the picture plane, often lacking normal perspective; 
they are not, in any sense, realist paintings. Their subjects are 
common objects and popular icons, whether from cartoons or 
movies. Warhol made several versions of Superman, he also 
used images of Dick Tracy and Sam Ketchum, as well as simple 
objects copied from newspaper advertisements: an Underwood 
typewriter, a candlestick telephone, a refrigerator. In the late 
1950s, Lichtenstein had done some expressionist versions of car- 
toon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Then, 
in the early 1960s, he began to paint those cartoon characters 
more directly and on a larger scale. At the same time, he started 
appropriating the graphic techniques of comic strips, incorporat- 
ing, for example, painted Benday dots and primary colors. 
His first Pop paintings were of objects around the house: 
black, white, and yellow depictions of washing machines and 
bathroom fixtures. Soon afterward, he produced his first single- 
frame comic-strip paintings. One shows a giant peephole with a 
man peering through it, and a dialogue bubble that says, "i can 

SEE THE WHOLE ROOM.' . . . AND THERE'S NOBODV IN IT.'" 2 The man IS 




looking at us, and it is pretty clear that we are the nobodies. In 
another, a clean-cut young military officer says, "i am supposed 
to report to a mr. Bellamy, i wonder what he's like" — a sly ref- 
erence to the gallerist Richard Bellamy (figs. 17 and 18). 

When recognition first came to Rosenquist, with an exhibi- 
tion at Bellamy's Green Gallery in February 1962, he was hailed 
as a new and important member of the nascent Pop art move- 
ment in America — thanks mostly to his renderings of consumer 
products, from peaches to paper clips, and of movie stars, such 
as Joan Crawford and Marilyn Monroe. I first encountered 
Rosenquist's work in November of that year, when the Sidney 
lams Gallery staged the astounding New Realists (fig. 19). It was 
one of the wildest shows Janis ever put on— a mixture of as- 
semblage art. New Image art, and Pop by both Americans and

Rosenquist was undeniably an important figure in Pop art. 
but his significant work began independently of the movement 
and continued on to become something that was quite distinct 
from it. In Pop art. there is generally a figure-ground relation- 
ship—a rendering of a specific object, often an inherently flat 
object, such as a nag or a newspaper page, against a colored 
or neutral background. Simple graphic devices— outlines and 
color relationships— may suggest a sort of depth, but there is 
rarely any perspective. Rosenquist, however, rendered forms 
three-dimensionally Few of his images seem to sit precisely on 
the picture plane; things are going on behind, and things are 
pressing forward as well. His color palette is more varied than 
that of the other Pop artists— sometimes he works in grisaille, 
sometimes in lurid Day-Glo; sometimes in naturalistic color; 
sometimes in "wrong color"— and his shifts in the scale of ob- 
jects within a composition are more drastic. The forms and 
arrangements in a Rosenquist painting can be as varied as those 



in a de Kooning. Another factor that sets Rosenquist apart from 
the other Pop artists is the degree to which he has relied on 
handpainting. He has rarely used any mechanical means — the 
stencils or silk-screening that Lichtenstein and Warhol favored. 
He is a superb painter in a very traditional sense, producing very 
unrraditional images. 

By the mid-1960s, Rosenquist's compositions had become 
extremely complex Even in modest, almost straightforward 
paintings, such as Dishes (1964, cat. no. 45). he often closes m on 
his subject and crops it until the space becomes claustrophobic. 
Compare his Marilyn Monroe J, for instance, with Warhol's ver- 
sions of Monroe (fig. 20). Warhol, although he varied colors and 
paint handling from version to version, always used the same 
recognizable iconic image. In Rosenquist's Marilyn Monroe I. we 
see parts of Monroe's face and a curve of her body, but we do 
not see a whole figure. She is cropped, inverted, and decon- 
structed in startling ways, and other elements in the composi- 
tion—the letters "a-r-i-i -v"— both suggest and obscure her 
identity. None of it is literal, yet somehow, as we look, we un- 
derstand that it is a portrait of a glamorous woman And once 
we read the title, we realize who it is

When I was a boy, I weni to a museum with my mother. 
There were on the same wall a painting, a shrunken head, 
and a Iwe flower. It was almost like what they would have in 
an Oriental tea ceremony. Three different things. Well, what 
does that mean? That shrunken head, and that painting, and 
that flower. For me, that's almost the beginning of collage. 
The idea of juxtapositions of What? or Who? 

Rosenquist is not a Surrealist artist — you were a Surrealist only 
if Andre Breton declared you to be one — but he does have 
affinities with the Surrealists. He has made imaginative jumps 
and juxtapositions like no other artist of his time. In Star Thief 
(1980, cat. no. 95), an image of a woman's head floats in space, 
alongside gears, rashers of uncooked bacon, and stars. When 
Rosenquist produced Star Thief, the Dade County Art in Public 
Places program selected it for Miami International Airport, but 
the installation was vetoed by the then-chairman of Eastern 
Airlines, former astronaut Frank Borman. He said something to 
the effect of, "I've seen outer space, and there is no bacon in 
outer space." There is no woman's head in outer space either, 
but somehow it was the bacon that offended him. The Comte 
de Lautreament, who was much admired by the Surrealists, 
once wrote about a "chance meeting on a dissecting table of a 
sewing machine and an umbrella " In Rosenquist's work, things 
we cannot imagine together coincide in just that way. 

During his long career, Rosenquist has developed a broad 
range of methods for putting a painting together, for incorporat- 
ing a collection of things into a composition in such a way that 
they make a kind of sense, even if it is sometimes in counter- 
point to what the individual objects imply. One early method he 
used was to divide the pictorial spaces of a canvas symmetrically 
into four quadrants and quite arbitrarily, it would seem, put a 
different cropped image in each one. In 4-1949 Guys (1962, cat. 
no. 22) and 4 Young Revolutionaries (1962, cat. no. 21), for exam- 
ple, we see curious details of young men, but each fragment is 
left somewhat unrevealed or ambiguous. In other works, the 
elements may be set edge to edge or juxtaposed so that they 
seem to overlie or even mesh with each other; sometimes, the 
edges are serrated so that two layers interlock, as in Star Thief, 
where the woman's head is cut out in a series of long triangular 



incisions. Sometimes, objects float around against a celestial 
background, as in Through the Eye oj the Needle to the Anvil (1988, 
cat. no. 114) and Time Dust-Black Hole (1992, cat. no 123). 

Occasionally, Rosenquist also creates an interior space 
within his work — depictions of or actual shiny surfaces in which 
things are reflected. In The Stowaway Peers Out at the Speed oj Light 
(2000, cat. no. 147), a hollow cylinder, hurtling through space, is 
reflective on both the inside and outside. In Flamingo Capsule 
(1970. cat. no. 72). alumimzed Mylar side panels mirror the 
painted panels. Rosenquist has also disrupted space in quite lit- 
eral ways: for Forest Ranger (1967. cat. no. 68). he painted an 
Army tank onto Mylar, which he then cut into strips, so that you 
could walk through it. like a car going through a car wash — 
when it is still, you can see the whole tank, but it dematerializes 
as you pass through it. 

With these devices, Rosenquist has managed to include 
more compositional elements than almost any of his contempo- 
raries. Whereas Lichtenstein and Warhol were oriented toward 
single images. Rosenquist is an artist for whom the conjunction 
is almost invariably "and" rather than "or." A classic example of 
a Rosenquist painting is / Love You with My Ford. The paintine is 
divided into three images: the grille and headlights of a Ford; 
the cropped heads of an embracing couple, with the female face 
in profile, eyes closed; and a close-up of spaghetti with sauce. 
Spaghetti, incidentally, turns up in a number of Rosenquist's 
works. I once asked him why. and he said, "Two reasons: I like 
the way it looks, and I like the way it tastes." You can never pre- 
dict how Rosenquist is going to think about things, and if he is 
thinking of something he likes, he is liable to put it right into a 
painting, whether or not it makes sense to anyone else. Another 
painting from the same period, President Elect (1960-61/1964, 
cat. no. II). has a tripartite structure with, left to right, a close- 
up of John F. Kennedy's face, a woman's hands holding a slice of 
cake, and a portion of an automobile, As Rosenquist explains 
"The face was from Kennedy's campaign poster. I was very in- 
terested at that time in people who advertised themselves. 
What did they put on an advertisement of themselves? So that 
was his face And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece 
of stale cake." Sometimes it is obvious how the elements in 
Rosenquist's works go together; sometimes the combinations

are startling. And sometimes each object is rendered in a differ- 
ent style. In 1 Love You with My Ford, the front end of the Ford is 
painted illusionistically, crisp and precise; the embracing couple 
is impressionistic and monochromatic; and the spaghetti is soft 
and more lyrical. 

There are several ways in which Rosenquist has made his 
paintings convincing: through a unifying color scheme, through 
a unifying surface (although many of his works are built on col- 
laged and mixed-media studies, they are fully painted, edge to 
edge, in layers and washes), and through a unifying structure. I 
would call his compositions post-Cubist. The work of Picasso. 
Braque, Juan Gris. and Fernand Leger is at play all the way 
through de Kooning, but Rosenquist moved beyond that It is al- 
most impossible to put together collagelike shapes without their 
somehow relating to Cubist structure, but Rosenquist did so — 
in ways that anticipate some of the art we call "postmodern." 
Air Hammer (1962. cat. no. 30) is made up of two vertical details 
of car doors, floating in a neutral background space. They are 
placed together in a deliberately disjunctive way — the pieces do 
not match up — and this makes for an abstract kind of composi- 
tion. In the more classical Lanai (1964, cat. no. 43), a diagonal 
upside-down automobile is the central image that holds 





together an otherwise very active horizontal composition. On 
the left, in larger scale than the car, is a plate of canned peaches. 
Over on the right, a nude woman sits on her haunches at the 
edge of a swimming pool. A metal spoon with the peaches is 
balanced by the metal swimming-pool ladder. There is a Day- 
Glo quality to the peaches, and the woman is portrayed in a 
monochromatic glowing red. To many eyes, this would seem to 
be a chaotic composition, but its three primary zones are stable, 
and the forms parallel and echo each other in ways that make us 
keep looking and thinking. 

Even before the mid-1960s, when he moved into a studio on 
Broome Street in SoHo, Rosenquist had begun incorporating 
three-dimensional elements into his paintings. In Untitled (Blue 
Sky) (V)b2. cat no. 29), we see a man's and a woman's legs below 
the knees, but the rest of their bodies is missing. Positioned near 
the top of the canvas, where the heads of those figures might be, 
two rectilinear panels, painted the same color as the back- 
ground, float outward, not so much objects as spatial extensions 
of the painting— a third dimension added to the surface of the 
canvas. Normally, we take in a background, like a wall or a patch 
of sky. quickly and do not focus on any single part of it, 1 have

the feeling that Rosenquist attached the panels to punctuate 
that background and force us to think about it. In Nomad (1963, 
cat. no. 40). plastic sheeting with splattered paint on it cantilevers 
out from the canvas, and paint-splotched pieces of wood lie on 
the ground below. The images within the painting itself are pre- 
sented in vastly different scales, tipped at angles, woven together, 
and cropped in ways that are more complicated than anything 
Rosenquist had done before that time. By this time, he had seen 
some of Johns's works — such as Device (1961-62, fig. 22), which 
has objects attached to the canvas — but the way in which 
Rosenquist included three-dimensional elements is quite differ- 
ent, and it is something that one finds later in David Salle's work. 



Sometimes it seems the day is so intense, there's no time for 
imagination. Then, when I go to bed, I think, Oh, boy — 
I'm getting into my studio. Because it's where I can think. As 
I just drift off to sleep, I might have an idea and I'll jump up 
and write it down. Especially a title. Sometimes a title sets off 
an idea. Sometimes an idea will bring about a title, and so on. 
A number of experiences that I have, being conscious, will 
an n into a dream that's sort of an abstraction. 

Rosenquist's subject matter is heterogeneous. Every imaginable 
kind of consumer product and a whole category of scientific in- 
struments can be found in his work. He has used typography 
and diagrams: one painting. Doorstop (1963. fig. 23), is just a 
black-and-white floor plan of a house, equipped with lightbulbs 
and intended to be hung on the ceiling. There are paintings that 
have to do with communication — especially electronic commu- 
nication. There are computer keyboards and coaxial cables. It 
just occurred to Rosenquist that these things were important 
and interesting, and he found ways to put them in his work. 
And there are people, both known and anonymous, though it 
has never been especially important for him to show specific 
people; when he does, they are cropped or fragmented so that 
they represent more than any one person. 

Rosenquist has also done several extraordinary paintings 
that can be read as antiwar statements. The most famous one, 
F-lll (1964-65, cat, no. 54). which is eighty-six-feet long end to 




end, shows, among other things, an F-lll fighter plane, a nuclear 
bomb detonating, and a little girl sitting under a hair dryer, the 
chrome hood of which looks like a warhead. A later work. Mas- 
querade of the Military Industrial Complex Looking Down on the 
Insect World (1992, cat. no. 126), shows vulnerable bits of life on 
some godforsaken planet It is one of the most bizarre ways to 
handle a terrifying theme that I can imagine. People often say 
that the last beings to go, if there were a holocaust on earth, 
would be the cockroaches, but this painting seems to suggest 
that certain events could destroy all life. 

In 1971, Rosenquist, his wife, and their son were hurt in a 
tragic car crash, and this drastically disrupted his career But 
there are some important works from the 1970s, among them 
Paper Clip (1973, cat. no. 75), whose beautiful sequence of images 
includes an upside-down line of text that reads, "this is love in 
1971.'' Another work that I especially like from that eta is Indus- 
trial Cottage (1977. cat. no. 82), an atonal painting that evokes 
the colors of Nicolas Poussin and includes such imagery as coax- 
ial cable wires, a clothesline with two strips of bacon pinned to 
it. a window looking out onto power lines, and drill bits. 
"It's domestic tranquility in an industrial park," Rosenquist ex- 
plains. "Your clothes on a clothesline, or your bacon. It's pat I ol 
everybody's life. Part of everybody's breakfast." It is a dynamic 
composition that somehow manages to seem rational. 

Since the 1980s. Rosenquist has worked on several series ol

paintings. In the 1980s and early 1990s, he made an enormous 
body of work dealing with flowers These paintings are not sim- 
ple still lifes; to make the preparatory collages for them, Rosen- 
quist cut pictures of flowers up into slivers and arabesques and 
generated crazy matrixes by shuffling them together. (See. e.g.. 
Nasturtium Salad, 1984. cat. no. 103. and Passion Flowers, 1990, 
cat. no. 121. and the related collages, cat. nos. 185 and 191.) The 
flower paintings relate visually to other works, including Wel- 
come to the Water Planet (1987. cat. no. 109), that address the 
lushness of the earth. There are the Gift Wrapped Dolls (1992-93, 
e.g., cat. nos. 127-29). a set of eerie paintings of dolls wrapped in 
cellophane, and there is a series of works about guns (1996) 
which makes it clear how much Rosenquist hates guns (e.g.. cat. 
nos. 134 and 135). Some gun paintings, such as The Specific Target 
(1996, cat. no. 132). include images of eyeglasses. "In Central 
America," Rosenquist says, "the revolutionary peasants would 
shoot anybody wearing glasses, because they thought they were 
of a higher class. It's a metaphor for the intellect |But| the in- 
tellect remains, even though the people are killed." 

There are the outer-space paintings, which include Star 'Unci. 
Through the Eye of the Needle to the Anvil, and Time Dust- 



Black Hole. These paintings resemble hallucinatory dreams, in 
which everything floats and there is no predictable form of grav- 
ity. The scale of things is strange, as is the selection of images. 
In the haunting Time Dust-Black Hole, a number of objects — 
among them, a French horn, a beer can, and pencils — move 
through space toward a soft-edged dark void at the center, al- 
most a warp hole into a parallel universe In Through the Eye of 
the Needle to the Anvil, a set of seemingly inexplicable images 
floats through space: high-heeled shoes on a pedestal, a flower- 
like form, a sewing needle, an iron anvil, and the head of a pin 
(so enlarged that it is almost unidentifiable). Laserlike beams 
seem to be projected through the eye of the needle. I thought I 
was tripping the first time I saw the painting. According to 
Rosenquist, the work is about his mother, "about that little tiny 
thread of a woman's intuition that is then hammered out on an 
anvil into cinema, theater, dance, painting, music, anything. 
When this little thread appears, it can get squelched. Then it 
becomes half a cerebrum, half a skull. But coming out of the 
bottom of the brain is this rush of information. There's a gland 
in the base of the brain shaped like a flower, the thalamus, and 
that's what the flower form is." At some indeterminate distance 
between the foreground and infinity, there is a pattern of h 
form, Arp-like shapes, crisply painted and arrayed in a kind of 
constellation. When I asked Rosenquist what those blobs were, 
he whispered in my ear. "That's chaos." It made my hair stand 
on end. I have never known another artist who would presume 
to paint chaos. 

An extraordinary set of three paintings. The Swimma in the 
Econo-misi 1 1997-98, cat. noi 1 16 18), emerged from a commis- 
sion for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. Everything in these 
paintings is in flux, thrown into a whirling vortex of anamorphic 
shapes. In The Swimmei in the Econo-misi (painting 3). the coni- 
cal hairdryer from F-IJJ is reprised, now surrounded by lipsticks. 
"The little girl who was the pilot of the I -ill is now the heiress 
who controls Wall Street," Rosenquist says. This group of works 
is dominated by the color red, but it also contains yellow and 
black to make up the colors of the German Hag. In The Swim- 
mer in the Econo-mist (painting 1), a quite literal depiction of 
Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) floats toward the right of the 
painting into a red river of activity. It is bent and broken, as M ll 



fig 25 The Meteor Hits the Swimmer's Pillow 
(1997 cat no 139) 



has been tossed in and damaged as it rushes along. There are 
several consumer products caught up in the stream as well, and I 
think we are meant to see Picasso as the quintessential artist, 
swimming in the "econo-mist," a torrent of cultural and eco- 
nomic activity "We can't avoid it — it's just there and we get 
caught up in it." Rosenquist observes. "I guess I've rejected the 
banality and greed involved in advertising, but I've seen it bring 
color into our lives." According to him, he recalled an old Venet- 
ian proverb. "The artist swims in the water, the critic stands 
ashore." and asked himself. "Am I in there? Or am 1 standing on 
the bank watching it? I think I'm in there." 

In the 1990s. Rosenquist worked on an unusual quartet of 
paintings: The Meteor Hits the Swimmer's Pillow (1997, fig. 25). 
The Meteor Hits Brancusi's Pillow (1997-99, fig. 98). The Meteor 
Hits Monet's Garden (1999). and The Meteor Hits Picasso's Bed 
(1996-99, cat. no. 140). Each is painted in a different manner, but 
the paintings belong together. What drew Rosenquist to these 
particular artists is unclear; they are artists he has admited, yes, 
and Picasso is an obvious choice, but Brancusi seems an odd in- 
clusion. The "swimmer" is perhaps the anonymous contempo- 
rary artist, or even Rosenquist himself I asked him, "Why hit by 
a meteor?" And he said, "I don't mean that they were killed. I 
mean hit by a meteor as in the inexplicable event." He went on, 
"In 1938, 1 was living in western Minnesota, and, twelve miles 
north of me, a great big fat lady was lying in bed one night when 
a meteor as big as a baseball came crashing through her roof, hit 
her on the hip, and went through the floor. It didn't kill her, but 
it gave her a giant bruise — and it was the talk of the town! So I 
thought about that, and I thought about a meteor as a natural 
disaster that comes from space like an exclamation point. What 
does it mean to be hit by one? That you're lucky or unlucky?" 
Rosenquist did what he has done when planning so many of his 
works. He thought about it, and he asked himself. "What if?" In 
a sense, he is a true connoisseur of the inexplicable 

The paintings in Rosenquist's The Speed of Light series 
(1999-2001, e.g., cat. nos. 142, 143. 146, and 147) are among the 
most abstract works he has ever done, but they are not entirely 
abstract. In an audacious way, he tried to imagine and paint di- 
mensionally what it would be like to travel at the speed of light. 
"In Einstein's study of the speed of light," he says, "apparently 




the speeding person looks out the window, and the view is al- 
tered because of the tremendous speed. And then the spectator, 
watching the speeding person — the look of that is also altered. 
Things are crammed together, and they're foreshortened. It's a 
pun, really. Like the difference between the artist and the critic, 
how different people see different things." There are several 
kinds of painting going on in The Stowaway Peers Out at tlu: 
Speed of Light, the largest work in the series. The painting is or- 
ganized and dimensional on the left, and as it proceeds to the 
right, it becomes progressively freer and more chaotic. There are 
reflective objects painted with trompe-l'oeil precision. Then, not 
as illusionistically rendered, there are waves of visible energy in 
a variety of colors that vibrate with an irregular motion. They 
appear to travel at a great speed across the canvas, and they 
make me think of the light show at the end of Stanley Kubticl 
2001 (1968). Some waves bounce off the reflective areas at crazy 
angles; others bounce around within them Things gel explosive.

And. finally, in the right-hand sector of the work, are passages 
where the paint is laid on in a gestural. Abstract Expressionist 
manner and which are not meant to be illusionistic at all. 

Rosenquist has also ventured into sculpture and installa- 
tions. Tumbleweed (1963-66. cat. no. 64), is a freestanding object, 
with an armature of wooden beams laid out like a child's jack so 
that it supports itself, wrapped in a great net of chromed barbed 
wire, with a rope of neon inside that lights up. It is an abstract 
work; it does not actually depict anything. At the same time, for 
anyone who has ever seen a tumbleweed, the sculpture suggests 
its shape and movement in a marvelous way. Rosenquist also 
used barbed wire in Toaster (1963, cat. no. 41), a piece that is far 
more straightforward. A small rectangular box about the size 
and shape of a toaster, it is coated in plastic and has fragments 
of advertising logos painted on it. The top sprouts fake grass, 
and in the slots where bread would go, there are buzz-saw 
blades sticking out. The whole thing is wrapped laterally in 
barbed wire. It is one of the most humorous things Rosenquist 
has ever done, but it suggests one hell of a breakfast. "It's a bad 



morning." he says, "but it's contemporary industrial life. The 
barbed wire was about the military-industrial complex— it's 
bright and shiny and chrome-plated, yet it's, you know, barbed 
wire. And it stops people from doing things," 

An exquisite miniature less than five inches high. Calyx 
Krater Trash Can (1976. cat. no. 258) is handcrafted in gold. On 
the side is an etched image of the famous Greek vase in the Met- 
ropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This combination of im- 
ages— garbage pail and precious vase— interested Rosenquist so 
much that, in 1977, he made a set of related prints (e.g.. cat. nos. 
259-62) But his most radical tim-e-dimensional piece is a multi- 
panel room installation. Horizon Home Sweet Home (1970. cat. no. 
73) The walls of a room are lined with aluminized Mylar panels 
and canvas panels painted in different colors. Periodically, from 
ground level, dry-ice fog climbs halfway up the walls, creating an 
unreal environment in which visitors, visible only from the waist 
up. become a part of the sculptural work. The "horizon" ol the 
title is the line where fog ends and people begin. In a way, the 
piece disembodies and relocates people to another world. 



/ think the best thing is having an idea and not knowing 
how to make It Because of that, some new form might appear. 
Whether it's good, bad, banal, or fantastic, you can reflect on 
that and go further. Once I've finished a painting, I can see 
where other imagery might go. I'll be about to change it, and 
then I'll think, No, I'm going to go on to the next painting. 

Pop art was, ultimately, a historical moment and only one part 
of a broader imperative that spanned the twentieth century and 
which I call "imagism." I believe there are three essential modes 
in twentieth-century art: the realist, the modernist, and the 
imagist. By "realist," I mean the kind of art that, in a representa- 
tional way, depicts figures or objects in a semblance of perspecti- 
val space. Balthus and Edward Hopper were major realist 
artists, and realism lives on in the photography of William 
Eggleston, Robert Frank, and Lee Friedlander, as well as in Vija 
Celmins's exquisite works. I use "modernist" to refer to art that 
may include evocative images but is so abstracted or stylized 
that it can in no way be confused with a literal rendering. The 
term can be applied to artists as disparate as Stuart Davis, Piet 
Mondrian, and Picasso. Abstract Expressionism was. of course, 
one of the great modernist adventures, but there are important 
modernist works still being produced by Mary Heilman, Robert 
Irwin, Brice Marden, Frank Stella, James Turrell, and others. I use 
the term "imagist" in the way that the poets H.D. (Hilda Doolit- 
tle) and Ezra Pound did — to describe the use of precise, detailed, 
and sometimes unexpected imagery in place of abstract ideas, or. 
as Pound put it, "an intellectual and emotional complex in an 
instant of time." In imagist art, specific, recognizable things are 
depicted, but they are shown in disjunctive combinations or un- 
real settings. A list of imagist artists would include Francis Bacon. 
Joseph Cornell, Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, and Man Ray, as well as 
more recent figures such as Jeff Koons, Sherrie Levine, Sigmar 
Polke, Salle, and Haim Steinbach. Some artists are not limited to 
a single mode, and there are artists, such as Marcel Duchamp and 
Georgia O'Keeffe, who have worked in all three. 



Rosenquist is an important and remarkable imagist, in the 
original sense of the word. He is very much a visual poet. Some- 
times his poems are epic; sometimes they are vast in subject or 
in scale— but they are still poems. His paintings are not narra- 
tive, like a novel; they are rich and complex, but you can read 
them in a short span of time. He orchestrates combinations 
that seem absurd— a French horn and a black hole— but those 
combinations also make a curious sense, both formally and psy- 
chologically. How does it occur to anyone to put high-heeled 
shoes, the head of pin, and an anvil in one painting? It is just 
sheer poetic imagination. 

Throughout his career, Rosenquist has seen human beings 
and their artifacts as the signs, symbols, and measure of our cul- 
ture. He has shown us not only the iconic fact of consumer soci- 
ety but the poetry of it too. He has painted the things we make 
and the things we keep around, from furniture to food, from guns 
to nuclear bombs. He turned an Army tank into a curtain we can 
walk through. He took the body of Marilyn Monroe and re- 
arranged it until it was at once delicious and tragic. Rosenquist 
has managed constantly to surprise us. to make us look at things 
twice. His work is multivalent. It is precise yet ambiguous, rever- 
berating in ways that more explicit works cannot. He has tackled 
some of the most important themes of his time. He has taken on 
the human condition, and yet he has remained idiosyncratic, 
analogical. He looks right and sees left. Heading for a Chinese 
restaurant, he talks not about Chinese food but about the best 
ham sandwich he ever had. When he is going to take you up. 
first he shows you down. His ideas seem to come out of the blue. 
I could not even begin to guess where he will go from here.

CONNOISSEUR OF THE INEXPLICABLE 



james rosenquist: 
collage and the 
painting of modern life 



JULIA BLAUT 




16 I » 



Collage is still a very contemporary medium, whether it is 
done with little bits of paper or in the cinema. The essence 
of collage is to take very disparate imagery and put it together 
and the result becomes an idea, not so much a picture It's 
like listening to the radio and getting your own idea from all 
these images that are often antidotes — acid — to each other 
They make sparks or they don't. The best thing is that they 
make sparks 

In collage there is a glint . . . or reflection of modern life. 
For example, if you take a walk through midtown Manhattan 
and you see the back of a girl's legs and then you see out of 
the corner of your eye a taxi comes close to hitting you. So — 
the legs, the car — you see parts of things and you rationalize 
and identify danger by bits and pieces. It's very quick. It's 
about contemporan life — James Rosenquist 1 



Observer, philosopher, fldneur — call him what you will. 
but whatever words you use in trying to define this kind of 
artist, you will certainly be led to bestOW upon him SOm 
twe wlueli you could not apply to the painter of eternal, or at 
least more lasting things Sometimes he is .? poet, more 
often he comes closer to the novelist or the moralist; he is the 
painter of the passing moment and of all the suggestions of 
eternity that it contains. — Charles Baudelaire 2 



Having quit his day job as a billboard painter, James Rosenquist 
rented a loft in Lower Manhattan, at 3-5 Coenties Slip, in the 
fall of 1960 and began to apply his commercial art experience 
and vision to his paintings in the new studio. The works done 
at Coenties Slip show no trace of the Abstract Expressionist 
style that had dominated the art world in the latter part of the 
1950s and which Rosenquist had experimented with since arriv- 
ing in New York in 1955. Instead, the new paintings consist of 
recognizable fragments drawn from media sources that are re- 
combined into enigmatic compositions. Similar to the methods 
he used as a sign painter, the sources Rosenquist drew upon for 
his paintings did not come from nature, but rather from still 
photographic images that were often compiled into collage ma- 
quettes. Collage for Rosenquist, as it had been since the Cubists 
first experimented with the medium around 1912, was a 
metaphor for modern and specifically urban life. Fractured im- 
agery and discontinuous narrative were the devices Rosenquist 
chose in order to express an autobiographical, bird's-eye. and 
street-level view of the modern metropolis. 

Painting billboards over Times Square, the young artist 
from the Midwest found himself at one of the great urban cross- 
roads. It was the view from his perch above Forty-second Street 
(or crossing it), that Rosenquist recaptured in his paintings Tve 
often wished . . . that 1 could bring people to the back of the 
Astor Theater and have them look out the window of the sign 
into Times Square to let them see the color and the feeling. So 
the simplest , . . thing I could do would be to make an oil paint- 
ing of the illusion on canvas and try to give the feeling o\ this

numbness thac I get when being immersed in painting large 
imagery." 3 Viewed up close, the advertising images became ab- 
stract and mysterious, and what Rosenquist focused on, and 
later introduced in his studio paintings, were the formal proper- 
ties of color, texture, shape, and scale. Art crittc Lucy Lippard 
observed that "Rosenquist's experience as a billboard painter 
sharpened his reactions to the non-representational aspects ot 
outwardly representational forms." 4 In the paintings made at 
Coenties Slip. Rosenquist realized he could get "below zero" 5 — 
essentially beyond complete abstraction— by using fragments of 
recognizable subjects: "I got below nothing by introducing im- 
agery again . That nothing came from painting advertise- 
ments up-close so they didn't mean anything to me but color 
and form. They were recognizable imagery again, but I thought 
of them as completely nonobjective " 6 

Although Rosenquist's paintings from the early 1960s were 
rendered "with the same power [as the) billboards— the same 
strength and intensity and exactness," 7 the quick read of a road- 
side billboard or print advertisement is replaced by "information 
that seeps out slowly" 8 The familiar commercial images are scaled 
up. fragmented, and redirected; through unlikely juxtapositions, 
the images gain new meaning in the context of new visual 



relationships. Generally. Rosenquist omitted advertising text 
and brand specificity; if words are included, they are fragmented, 
becoming more image than word. In order to neutralize subject 
matter, he chose advertisements that were slightly out of date, 
as these images had neither entered the realm of history nor did 
they have the potency of current advertisements. 9 For Rosen- 
quist, "a good painting continues to ask you to seek out 
information it has to offer for a long time. That's something 
that's hard to accomplish on a single picture plane, even with 
the advent of movies and the electronic media. There's some- 
thing to the idea of the glimpse . . . After that glimpse, thei 
the follow-up " 10 Using multiple fragments— and later shardlike 
imagery, beginning in 1980 with Star T/n&lt;?/(cat. no. 95)— he was 
able to compress the greatest amount of visual information into 
the least amount of space. With collage, there is an inevitable 
rupturing of narrative that he found uniquely suited to express- 
ing the multifarious aspects of modern life. The effect of viewing 
a Rosenquist painting is. "like listening to the radio." as he said, 
or reading a magazine or newspaper. 

Visitors to Rosenquist's studio would have always been 
aware of the preparatory collages. By his own description, the 
Coenties Slip studio was "messy" "I'd write on the walls or I d 
write on pieces of paper and pin them all on the wall. The whole 
studio was a blackboard, a bulletin board. There were sketches 
everywhere . . . It was like a Joseph Cornell habitat. The room 
was knee-deep with things I found on the street. Anything I 
found that interested me— pages of magazines— I pinned CO th( 
wall." 11 The collages, however, were not exhibited publicly until 
1992, when twelve preparatory studies for early paintings were 
included in an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery. New York. 12 
Rosenquist was concerned that by showing the magazine 
sources "they could weaken the impact of the paintings " n 
Source images and/or collages existed for all his paintings, but 
in the past, he "didn't think much of them." Consequently, many 
of the collages did not survive, as typically they were thrown 
away between studio moves. 14 

The collages, like sketches from an artist's notebook, offer a 
glimpse at the thought process behind the finished paintings 
and reveal new dimensions to Rosenquist's art. The flexibilm ol 
collage lends itself to the working process— pieces are easily

added, subtracted, or adjusted until the desired composition is 
achieved. Rosenquist's highly tactile collages exhibit this free- 
dom, revealing traces of the changes made; notations, rough 
drawings, fingerprints, paint smudges, and glue are left in evi- 
dence. Their handmade appearance and intimate scale — small 
enough to have been held while the artist painted — are in 
marked contrast to the precision and often colossal size of the 
finished works. In the paintings, which are made entirely by the 
artist's own hand, the indexical traces are nearly imperceptible: 
"I wanted to paint so well that you wouldn't see my brush- 
stroke."^ Rosenquist's use of commercial-art techniques and 
media-derived sources led to his identification with Pop art. 
His emphasis on collage, however, is unique among the Pop 
artists and requires that his art be understood in a broader con- 
text. Indeed, Rosenquist's work represents a renovation of the 
modernist medium of collage, one that specifically responded to 
contemporary issues in the art world circa I960 



FROM BILLBOARDS TO PAINTINGS: THE COLLAGES AND THEIR SOURCES 
In Rosenquist's paintings, beginning in 1960 and until 1966 
(when he began to use his own photographs), it was primarily 
magazine imagery from about 1945 to 1955 that provided his 
source materials. For the most part, he used Life magazine be- 
cause of the large format of its photographic reproductions. 16 
The montage of unrelated images and text found in the pages 
of a magazine or newspaper were referred to by cultural critic 
Marshall McLuhan as "front-page cubism . . . [where] discon- 
nected items from China to Peru"' 7 are set side by side. Life's 
publisher, Henry Luce, however, aimed to "edit pictures into a 
coherent story — to make an effective mosaic out of the frag- 
mentary documents." 18 The jarring mix in Rosenquist's Fill 
(1964-65, cat. no. 54) of images of atomic warfare with those of 
middle-class prosperity parallel similar couplings found in the 
pages of Life. 19 Typical of the pairings is the one in the July 15, 
1946, issue, where a photo essay entitled "Bikini's Atomic Bomb" 
faces a Dixie Cup advertisement with a smiling girl eating a 
frozen ice. 20 As Life developed its editorial position in the atomic 
age, such images established, as Peter Bacon Hales pointed out, 
"a context of normalcy . . . This duality — of violence ... set 
against the reassuring safety of the everyday — recurred repeat- 
edly" within the pages of the magazine. 21 Yet where Luce aimed to 
create "a coherent story," Rosenquist, to convey the transience that 
is integral to modern experience, allowed his paintings to remain 
open-ended, with content that "seeps " 

The method Rosenquist applied for planning his paintings, 
and continues to use to the present day, is comparable to the 
one he used in planning and executing billboards. The penned- 
in grids on the surface of the collages are remnants of the 
scaling-up process, by which the artist is able to translate the 
small source images to paintings of sometimes enormous pro- 
portions. Rosenquist used the billboard-painters' term "Brook- 
lyn Bridge" to describe his technique for scaling up an image. 22 
At Artkraft-Strauss. where he was employed as a sign painter 
from 1958 to 1960. source materials were made available to him: 
"all kinds of imagery . . large and small. I would take bits and 
pieces and scale them into a blueprint or master plan 
Similarly, in his own paintings, he rejected the apparent improv- 
isation of Abstract Expressionism for readymade imagery; he

believed he "would be a stronger painter if I made most of my 
decisions before I approached the canvas." 24 For Rosenquist. the 
photographic fragments cut from magazine pages were like "a 
spark of an idea . . and then I elaborate . . . just a notation 
would get me going." 2S President Elect (1960-61/1964, cat. no 11), 
for example, was painted directly from a cropped poster and 
magazine clippings (cat. no. 152). without a sketch to predeter- 
mine their placement or scale within the painting. 26 

Because of their constancy, still photographs, rather than 
actual objects, which were subject to the fugitive effects of light, 
provided Rosenquist with his preferred source. 27 The ability to 
scale up and easily copy in paint small photographic images 
with near cameralike precision was a necessity for his commer- 
cial art. Applying these techniques to his own paintings, he 
could transform them into a personal idiom through manipula- 
tions of color, scale, and context. For a painting with a more com- 
plicated composition incorporating multiple objects, such as Look 
Alive (Blue Feet, Look Alive) (1961. cat. no. 10), A Lot to Like 1 1962 
cat. no. 25). and Silver Skies (1962. cat. no. 20). the source clip- 
pings were often paired with a preparatory drawing (cat. no. 156, 



fig. 30. and cat. no. 158). creating a guide for positioning how the 
images fit into a finished painting and establishing their relative 
size within it 

While Rosenquist's collages are works in process and are 
, onsldc red b) him to be maquettes, many of them transcend 
their utilitarian role and function independently as works of art. 
The suite (1964. cat. nos. 162-76) made for F-lll, for example, 
stands out visually as an exceptional group. They are highly 
textured as a result of the diversity of materials incorporated: 
Day-Glo spray paint on Mylar, rich watercolor on tracing paper, 
cut aluminum, black-and-white and color photographs (by Hollis 
Frampton), and cuttings from magazines The range and com- 
plexity of the collaged materials reflect the diversity of subjects 
and ideas in the final work. Painted on fifty-one individual pan- 
els or "fragments" of canvas fitted together, the collage-based 
painting itself is a syncopated visual puzzle. The artist equated 
each "fragment of this painting" to "a glimmer, a flash ol static 
movement." and it was his original intention to sell it in the 
individual parts. 28 

For F-fJJ. there is no extant master maquette. At some point 
during the planning of the work, however. Rosenquist attached 
several of the source images to one another to establish the 
sequencing within the painting and then documented it with a 
Polaroid camera (fig. 31). A group of collages study the body of 
the aircraft (cat. nos. 162-68), while parts such as the girl and 
hair-dryer hood (cat. nos. 169 and 171), the fork twirling spaghetti 
(cat. nos. 170 and 173). and the head of a diver with bubbles ris 
mg in the water (cat. no. 174) are explored in independent 
source images derived from magazines. 29 Strikingly beautiful in 
the preparatory works, as well as in the finished painting, is the 
remarkable range of colors: delicate washes of lavendii -ind 
blue-green (cat. no. 162). more heavily painted sections in rose, 
violet, ultramarine, orange, and yellow (fig. 32). and areas lightly 
spray painted in Day-Glo orange-red (cat. nos. 162 and 173) — 
Day-Glo indicating radioactivity.' The brilliance of Rosenquist's 
colors captures the "visual pyrotechnics" of what Hales referred 
to as the "atomic sublime": the highly aestheticized representa- 
tions of atomic warfare that could be found in Life magazine." 
Rosenquist's F-lll captures "the aesthetic of the atomic sublime, 
a visual restorative that took terror and converted it back to

beauty, took panic and transformed it to awe," 32 and it is this 
visual duality that he began to grapple with in the collages. 

In Montage and Modem Life /V19-J942, Christopher Philips 
observed that montage can function "as a kind of symbolic form, 
providing a shared visual idiom that . . . expressed the tumul- 
tuous arrival of a fully urbanized, industrialized culture."" 
Speaking of his own montage sensibility, Rosenquist made a sim- 
ilar statement: 'Painting from fragments is like painting from a 
contemporary landscape. It's what's available." 14 As with other 
painters of modern life, his method of collecting and compiling 
images with the intention of creating a spark pays homage, in- 
tentionally or not, to Walter Benjamin's unfinished The Arcades 
Project (Passagen-Werk), on which Benjamin worked from 1927 to 
1940. A study of the arcades, the indoor shopping streets, 
that thrived in nineteenth-century Paris, The Arcades Project is 
not a historical narrative in a conventional sense but is instead a 
literary pastiche comprised of various subsections that consist of 
long quotations, some historic and some contemporary. The 
form itself reflects the flux of modern history. The fragmentary 
texts became Benjamin's own through his process of selection 
and juxtaposition, much as Rosenquist's collected imagery be- 
came his through his choosing and contrasting. And while the 
finished paintings are visually synthesized, their meanings, char- 
acteristic of the ever-changing nature of the "contemporary land- 
scape," are difficult to pin down and reveal themselves slowly 

A section of The Arcades Project is dedicated to Baudelaire, 
with whom, in Benjamin's words, "Paris becomes for the first 
time the subject of lyric poetry . . . The gaze which the allegori- 
cal genius turns on the city ... is the gaze of the flaneur." 35 The 
arcades, which were once thoroughly modern glass and iron 
structures, are the site for what Benjamin called the phantas- 
magoria of the commodity — the spectacle of advertising and 
consumerism — and it is the flaneur who is "the observer of the 
marketplace." 36 As city dweller, onetime maker of billboards and 
collector of advertising imagery, Rosenquist was also a flaneut 
but one in an age in which mass media makes it unnecessary 
to wander outside in the streets. He would recall the hours of 
contemplation, observation, and reverie — the time spent nor 
painting — that went into his art making at Coenties Slip. The 
modern condition was described by Baudelaire using vaporous 





and ethereal terms. 37 Similarly, Rosenquist described to John 
Rublowsky the fluid conditions by which ideas came to him: "I 
was able to spend whole days and weeks in the loft. Most of the 
time I would paint, but there were also long stretches when I just 
sat there and thought without any interruptions. Sometimes I sat 
there from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon watching 
other people go to and from their |obs Then, suddenly, it 

seemed as though ideas came floating in to me through the win- 
dow. All I had to do was snatch them out of the air and begin 
painting. Everything seemed to fall into place — the idea, the 
composition, the imagery, the colors, everything began to work." 38 



BLAUT | COLLAGE AND THE PAINTING OF M00ERN LIFE 



COLLAGE IN NEW YORK, CIRCA 1960 

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the focus on collage was nor 
limited to the visual arts but was inevitably, in all mediums, 
linked to contemporary city life. In urban planning. Jane 
Jacobs's The Death and life of Great American Cities (1961) advo- 
cated "urban montage." an inclusive approach that focused on 
street life. 39 The essence of collage, in the form of found sounds 
and the splicing together of otherwise independent theatrical 
elements, was evident in the music of John Cage and the chore- 
ography of Merce Cunningham, whose collaborations Rosen- 
quist very much admired. 40 In the early 1960s. Judson Dance 
Theater, a collective of dancers and visual artists— including, 
among others. Trisha Brown. Robert Morris. Yvonne Rainer, and 
Robert Rauschenberg— was interdisciplinary in its approach, in- 
corporating pedestrian movement, found materials for stage 
sets, props, and costumes; and audio accompaniment consisting 
of incidental sounds. 

In literature, discontinuous narrative and collage were char- 
acteristics of the writings of the Beats. Rosenquist has fre- 
quently mentioned meeting Beat writers Allen Ginsberg and 
Jack Kerouac, among others."" William Burroughs, with whom 
Rosenquist attended readings on the Bowery, 42 was introduced 
to the cut up method by painter and writer Brion Gysin in 1959. 
In collaboration. Gysin and Burroughs experimented with mon- 
tage, including cut film and photographs, magazine illustrations, 
and newspaper clippings. Burroughs s cut ups involved cutting 
up his own writing as well as the work of other authors and ran- 
domly splicing them together to create a new text. Burroughs 
recognized that what he described as Gysin s "collage of words" 
recalled the chance poems that the Surrealist Tristan Tzara 
created by pulling words from a hat. 4 ' The randomness that 
played a key role in the poetry and montage of Tzara, Gysin, 
and Burroughs, however, is significantly different from Rosen- 
quist's very deliberate choices of source materials. 

Burroughs observed that "the cut up method brings to writ- 
ers the collage which has been used by painters for fifty years. 
And used by the moving and still camera." 44 Rosenquist himself 
has repeatedly referred to the work of the French New Wave 
filmmakers, including Francois Truffaut. Jean-Luc Godard, and 
Eric Rohmer, who began making feature films in the late 1950s. 



Blurring distinctions between real life and fiction, their 
films were typically shot on location — a mostly urban (often 
Parisian) mise-en-scene of streets, shops, and bars— used natu- 
ral light and sound, and often incorporated improvised dialogue. 
Their editing style, which very much fit Rosenquist's view of 
"film editing as a form of collage." 45 rather than having seamless 
transitions, used jump cuts and inserted images apparently un- 
related to the story line. Not unlike a Rosenquist painting, the 
endings of New Wave films are often left unresolved. Rosenquist 
mentioned his own interest in making a film in the late 1960s; 
budget constraints, however, thwarted the project. Instead, he 
"put whatever filmic ideas I had into my paintings " 4 " 

Several exhibitions in New York in 1960 and 1961 were 
dedicated to collage and mixed-media art, and they provided 
historical precedents and a contemporary context for the direc- 
tion Rosenquist's art was taking. While many contemporary 
critics condemned the new work made from nonart material- 
gallerists and curators hailed the breaking down of barriers be- 
tween artistic mediums and between art and the outside world. 
Particularly memorable for Rosenquist was the exhibition New 
Media-New Forms, held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in June 
1960 (fig. 33); the exhibition generated so much public Intel 
that the gallery opened a follow-up exhibition. New Media-New 
Forms, Version 2, In September. Jackson described the work 
included as part of a "new art expression in New York." 47 A 
full-scale exhibition devoted to mixed-media work, The Art of 
Assemblage, was held at the Museum of Modern Art in fall 1961. 
and it also made a lasting impression on the artist ls 

These three exhibitions focused on the connection between 
collage and the city. In Ins essay in the New Forms-New Media J 
catalogue, British curator Lawrence Alloway linked the new 
"junk culture" to Dada and Futurism, not to give it "an an hi 
tory, only to link it to a common source, the city. Junk culture is 
city art . . . Futurism and Dada. however, made the city central to 
their art, in terms of topicality of subject matter and experiment in 
technique. The source of junk culture is obsolescence, the throw- 
away material of cities, as it collects in drawers, closets, atti&lt; 
garbage cans, gutters, waste lots, and city dumps . . . Assembl a . • 
of such material come at the spectator as bits of a life, bits ol th« 
city, in a jostling reduction of esthetic distance ' ' I In- curator ot

The Art of Assemblage , William C. Seitz, quoted from a version of 
Alloway's passage in his own exhibition catalogue. Seitz main- 
tained that "the history of collage is primarily urban," stating 
that "from cubism and futurism, Duchamp and Schwitters, to 
the present, the tradition of assemblage has been predominantly 
urban in emphasis." He called special attention to New York: 
"The city — New York above all others — has become a symbol 
of modern existence. The tempo of Manhattan, both as subject 
and conditioning milieu, has been instrumental in forming the 
art of our time." 50 

Rosenquist's collages were conceptually different from the 
pieces in the two New Media-New Forms exhibitions and The Art 
of Assemblage, where the collages and constructions were con- 
ceived as finished works of art and emphasized the role of the 
found object in order to bring everyday experience into the 
realm of art. For Rosenquist, however, collage — generally, found 
naterials glued to a paper support — remained a step in the 
working process toward a finished painting in oil on canvas. As 
Alloway wrote. "Essential to junk culture is retention of the orig- 
inal status of the objects . . . their first function grittily resisting 
incorporation into a smooth esthetic whole." Although 
Alloway's description of an assemblage, as coming "at the spec- 
tator as bits of a life, bits of the city," could also describe the 
impact of a Rosenquist painting, Rosenquist was "not interested 



in finding things and making things out of them, [but rather] in 
how things that were found could be transformed." 51 The three 
exhibitions, however, established a context for Rosenquist's own 
explorations in collage during this period, and several of the par- 
ticipants were among the artists he most admired. He had been 
befriended by many of them during his early years in New York, 
and they had contributed to his formative experiences in the art 
world Among them were Joseph Cornell, Willem de Kooning, 
Marcel Duchamp, George Grosz, and Rauschenberg. 

Seitz had chosen the term "assemblage" rather than "col- 
lage" because the latter had primarily two-dimensional, painterly 
associations. 52 He stated that the "collages, objects, and con- 
structions" in the exhibition were "predominantly assembled 
rather than painted, drawn, modeled, or carved," and "their 
constituent elements are preformed natural or manufactured 
materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials." 53 
Although the first New Media-New Forms exhibition consisted of 
more than seventy mixed-media works, nearly all done in the 
past two years, and included only a handful of earlier twentieth- 
century pieces, it was a central premise of Seitz's The Art of Assem- 
blage (both the exhibition and its accompanying publication) to 
establish a historical foundation for contemporary work that 
crossed conventional artistic categories. 54 Seitz methodically 
progressed through the history of collage in twentieth-century 
Western art, from Cubist and Futurist collage and constructions 
to artist-made environments and Happenings. 

Seitz's catalogue opened with a discussion of Pablo Picasso's 
Sfill Life with Chair Caning (1912, fig. 34), which had been recog- 
nized as the first intentional collage. 55 Picasso made several 
startling additions to the Cubist still life oil cloth printed with 
trompe-l'oeil chair-caning is pasted to the painted surface, and a 
piece of rope substitutes for a conventional frame For Seitz. the 
Cubist invention of collage and the introduction of machine- 
made materials onto the canvas provided an historical precedent 
for contemporary assemblages, which ran counter to the purity of 
mediums central to the modernist paradigm. 56 He commented, 
"It would be absurd to suggest that the shift from oil painting to 
Marcel Duchamp's 'readymades,' Rauschenberg 's 'combine paint- 
ings.' or the untouched decollage of the afficheurs could have been 
extrapolated on the basis of Picasso's Still Life with Chair Caning.

yet it must be conceded that, by the introduction of a bit of oil 
cloth and a length of tope, the sacrosanctness of the oil medium 
suffeted a blow that was as deadly as it was deft." 57 

In Seitz's interpretation, the inclusion of the oil cloth and 
the rope frame blur distinctions between the make-believe 
world of the canvas and the real world beyond the picture 
frame. 58 This viewpoint differed markedly from early critics of 
Cubism as well as many of Seitz's contemporaries. Clement 
Greenberg. for example, maintained that papiet eolle and 
collage asserted the flatness of the painted surface and thus re- 
inforced the characteristic that distinguishes painting from 
all other mediums." John Canaday. who reviewed The Art of 
Assemblage for the New York Times, found the contemporary as- 
semblages to be "trivial and . . . specious" by contrast to the 
"significant" historical works; he remarked that Seitz's catalogue 
text "plays the tiresome game of forcing respectable antecedents 
upon a medium that in most of its aspects has made a fetish of 
disrespectabilit^ 

Seitz gave Dada particular attention. Dada had been 
founded in 1916 in Zurich by artists and writers who used un- 
conventional art materials and methods, including collage, pho- 
tomontage, readymades, and performance, not only to challenge 
traditional art practices (specifically. Expressionist painting) but 



also to oppose the political and economic climate th.u had given 
rise to World War 1. Although Seitz recognized that "neo-dada," 
the term often applied contemptuously by critics to the new 
mixed-media art, was a misnomer, he realized that Dada had irre- 
versibly opened up the possibilities for what constituted a work of 
art: "dada sweepingly affirmed the principle, previously proposed 
by |Guillaume] Apollinaire and the futurists, that art could hi 
created by any elements whatsoever." 61 Similarly. Alloway wrote 
in the New Forms-New Media catalogue that unlike Dada "then 
no protest in New York junk culture." but he credited Dada with 
having "brought expendable and repeatable objects into the time 
less and unique field of art. Duchamp's readymades . . . used 
mass-produced objects, and Dada collages . accepted th&lt; 
mass media (ads, newspapet layout)." 62 The Art of Assemblage, in 
particular, was a key to the widespread recognition of American 
Neo-Dada, which was synonymous with proto-Pop. 

Where Dada was represented only by a few collages by Kurt 
Schwitters in New Media-New Forms, The Art of Assemblage cap- 
tured the diversity of Dada artworks produced in Europe and 
the United States. Seitz exhibited more than thirty ofSchwitO 
Merz collages and painted constructions; most were from the Mu- 
seum of Modern Art's own collection. Working in Hanover until 
1937, Schwitters chose found materials that, despite his formal 
intentions, retain associations with their previous functions and 
with urban life (fig. 35); he stated, "What the material signified 
before its use in the work of art is a matter of indifference so 
long as it is properly evaluated and given artistic meaning in the 
work of art. And so I began to construct pictures out of maten 
als I happened to have at hand, such as streetcar tickets, cloak- 
room checks, bits of wood . . . These things are inserted into thi 
picture either as they are or else modified in accordance with 
what the picture requires." 61 Also exhibited were several exam- 
ples of Berlin Dada, including works by Grosz (a teacher ol 
Rosenquist's at the Art Students League. New York), Raoul 
Hausmann, and Hannah Hoch." For these artists, the staccato of 
disparate images inherent to collage— particularly the pho- 
tomontage technique they pioneeted— became a powerful mean 
for social criticism. While there was little overt "protest" in Pop 
art. Rosenquist's F-Ul certainly had much of the subversive spirit 
of Berlin Dada. As a commentary on the Vietnam War, its ironic

blend of militarism and capitalism finds a conceptual precedent in 
Grosz's photomontages that critique World War I. 65 

That two of the panelists at The Art of Assemblage sympo- 
sium in October 1961 were "founding fathers" of Dada — 
Duchamp and Richard Huelsenbeck — underscored the strong 
connection Seitz established between assemblage and Dada. 66 
Despite his claim to having stopped making art, Duchamp re- 
mained highly visible in the contemporary art scene and was not 
only an artist Rosenquist admired but also one he had come to 
know personally. 67 Several of Duchamp's readymades were in 
the exhibition, including a recent replica of Bottle Dryer (1914; 
also known as Bottlerack) from the collection of Rauschenberg. 
The readymades went well beyond collage in distancing the 
hand of an artist. As Duchamp explained at the symposium, a 
"replica of a Readymade delivers the same message" as the orig- 
inal ' ,s For Huelsenbeck, "The art of assemblage is an aesthetic 
expression of the present human situation," and he went on to 
discuss how the role of chance in Dada, for example, in the col- 
lages of Jean Arp, foreshadowed the role of the found object in 
contemporary assemblage. 69 He questioned the significance for 
art of the contemporary media's contrasting forces and its level- 
ing among diverse subjects. 70 His observations bring to mind the 
unexpected collisions of visual data in a Rosenquist painting 

Also strongly featured by Seitz were the Surrealists, artists 
with whom Rosenquist has frequently been compared. 71 Rosen- 
quist's 1964 exhibition at Galerie Ueana Sonnabend. Paris, was 
attended by Andr£ Breton (Surrealism's founder), Alberto 
Giacometti. Joan Miro, and others associated with the Surrealist 
movement. 72 Edouard Jaguer's essay on the artist, which had 
been published earlier that year, was excerpted in the 
Sonnabend catalogue, and it was Jaguer who claimed Rosen- 
quist as a Surrealist, 7 ' In New York. Rosenquist had come to 
know Cornell and met Salvador Dalf on several occasions. 
Although he did not subscribe to their emphasis on the uncon- 
scious mind, Cornell had exhibited with the Surrealists as early 
as 1932, in the exhibition Surrealisme at the Julian Levy Gallery. 
New York. Rosenquist visited Cornell's home and studio with 
some frequency, and it was Cornell's "habitat" full of collage ma- 
terials that Rosenquist compared to his own Cocnties Slip stu- 
dio. 74 Cornell collected the sights and materials of the city and 




assembled them into magical collages and self-contained em l- 
ronments housed in small wood boxes of his own fabrication; he 
also reedited found footage to make short "collage films." 75 The 
quality Rosenquist admired in Dalfs paintings, and which he ac- 
knowledged is characteristic of his own work as well, is their mix 
of realities and that they continue to impart "information long 
after you have thought you have seen |them]." 76 

The method of juxtaposition epitomized in the collages of 
Max Ernst is the most striking parallel between Rosenquist and 
the Surrealists. 77 For Ernst— as it would be for Rosenquist— the 
strange couplings of subjects in collage were meant to evoke 
something intangible Beniamm, in his study of the phantas- 
magoria of the arcades, had been much influenced by the dis- 
concerting combinations of commodity objects found in 
Surrealist art. and it was this fracture that he emulated in Tin- 
Arcades Project 79 Juxtapositions as found in Surrealism, Seitz 
stated, had a precedent in Giorgio de Chirico's Metaphysical 
paintings and Comte de Lautr£amont's "now-famous 'convul- 
sive' image of the 'chance encounter of a sewing machine and an 
umbrella on a dissecting table," 7 '' In 1921, Breton wrote how in 
his collages Ernst attained "two widely separate realities with- 
out departing from the realm of our experience, of bringing them 
together and drawing a spark from their contact," 80 a statement

that anticipates Rosenquist's collage aesthetic: "The essence of 
collage is to take very disparate imagery and put it together . . . 
The best thing is that they make sparks,*' For Rosenquist, like 
Ernst, it is the contrast of forms and subjects that creates the 
tension in his work and constitutes its content. 81 In a 1964 inter- 
view, Rosenquist stated, "If 1 use a lamp or a chair, that isn't the 
subject . . . The relationships may be the subject matter, the re- 
lationships of the fragments I do. The content will be something 
more, gained from the relationships. If I have three things, their 
relationship will be the subject matter; but the content will, 
hopefully, be fatter, balloon to more than the subject matter 
One thing, though, the subject matter isn't popular images " H2 

As Rosenquist himself observed, however, his differences 
with Surrealism are many. Where he favored making paintings 
that rival billboards in size. Surrealist paintings are generally 
small, "medicine cabinet scale." His imagery "was much larger 
than life so [it] spilled out the front of the picture plane rather 
than [as in Surrealist painting] receding into a picture-scape " 8} 
Instead, the shallow space in his paintings, with its emphasis on 
the foreground, resembles Seitz's description of Cubist space: 



"Gradually, (Braque and Picasso] limited the deep space by 
which artists had represented the world since the fifteenth cen- 
tury. The objects they depicted no longer diminished in size or 
disappeared in light and atmosphere . . their subjects were 
pressed forward by the advancing rear wall of the picture, so 
that cubism became an art of the close-up." Moreover, Rosen- 
quist's carefully deliberated canvases are in stark contrast to 
what Seitz referred to as "the central principle of Surrealism, as 
Andre Breton defined it in his manifesto of 1924 ... its recourse 
to 'pure psychic automatism."' 84 

In the catalogue section entitled "Collage Environment," 
Seitz stated that "New York's vernacular power . . . was a major 
component of abstract expressionism." 85 Woman (1950. fig. 36), a 
small oil on paper with a collage element attached, was the only 
de Kooning included in The Art of Assemblage. 86 The woman's 
mouth — cut from the "T-Zone" of a Camel cigarette advertise- 
ment in Time magazine — was referred to by Thomas Hess as a 
"fragment of trompe-l'oeil reality." 87 It was de Kooning's use of 
collage that Seitz considered most significant for the younger 
generation of artists, including Bruce Conner, Jasper Johns, and 
Rauschenberg. Seitz observed that de Kooning "intensified the 
interest in 'pop culture' . . . |and] for a new generation and in an- 
other spirit, [his] adulterative gesture may have had an effect 
not unlike Picasso's in 1912 ."«* De Kooning also used collage to 
establish the composition of his larger-than-life-size paintings ot 
the Woman series. Seitz quoted from Hess's essay "De Kooning 
Paints a Picture." which systematically shows how Woman J 
(1950-52) was developed through a series of working drawings 
that the artist — using what Hess referred to as the "Procrustean 
method" — "cut apart, reversed, exchanged and otherwise ma- 
nipulated on the painting." Akin to Rosenquist's own method ol 
planning a painting, this process "permits the artist to study 
possibilities of change before taking irrevocable steps." 89 Seitz 
took Hess's lead, stating that de Kooning's "paintings of female 
figures were an incarnation of the city." &lt;; ° "De Kooning's percep- 
tions focus on the New York he daily observes," wrotr He! 
and "such are the observations he is ambitious to translate — or 
rather to synthesize — with the plastic means he controls "'" 

At the time Rosenquist moved to New York in 1955, the repu- 
tation of the New York School was "tremendous." 92 He became

well acquainted with de Kooning and other Abstract Expres- 
sionists, and it was their art that he had to reckon with in order 
to establish his own artistic language. Like many artists of his 
generation, he made abstract paintings in the mid to late 1950s 
but found ultimately that Abstract Expressionism was irrelevant 
to his own life experience: "Experience makes the art. I never 
had de Kooning's experience so how could I paint like that ex- 
cept to learn things. It was not my statement." 93 Rosenquist's 
Woman I (1962, cat. no. 19) is the younger artist's answer to 
de Kooning's painting of the same name, which had reintro- 
duced figuration into the Abstract Expressionist's work a decade 
earlier. 94 The impulsive, painterly brushstroke that was 
de Kooning's signature style is replaced by a different kind of vir- 
tuoso painting, a carefully rendered and massive enlargement of 
multiple sources. Both Woman I paintings, by de Kooning and 
Rosenquist, arc done on canvases life-size or bigger, which at 
once create an intimate viewing experience by enveloping the 
viewer into the large canvas, yet are overwhelming due to the 
sheer enormity of the imagery. Rosenquist's composition further 
accentuates the woman's mouth by juxtaposing it in three differ- 
ent views and only showing the head, not the full body. The 
painted grisaille mouth, especially, retains the look of collage, 
like the magazine clipping pasted to de Kooning's Woman of 1950; 
the ferocious grin of de Kooning's Woman I, however, is replaced 
with the demure smiles of women in advertisements. The splay- 
ing open of the figure, the repetition of forms observed from 
different viewpoints, the gridlike infrastructure of the composi- 
tion, and the reliance on popular source material are Cubist 
devices used by de Kooning that are carried over by Rosenquist 
in this homage. 

Collage came to the fore in the work of Rauschenberg, who 
became a friend of Rosenquist's after they met in 1956. 95 Present- 
ing a direct challenge to modernism. Rauschenberg's famously 
inclusive approach to art was summed up in his statement 
quoted in The Art of Assemblage catalogue: "Painting relates to 
both art and life. Neither can be made. (I try to act in that gap 
between the two)." 96 His Combines (1954-64), in particular, 
defied established artistic categories, expanded on Duchamp's 
concept of the readymade, and incorporated found objects 
as well as found images. The Combine Odalisk (1955/1958, 



fig. 37), which refers in subject and title to the odalisques of 
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and is a kind of Woman I in its 
own right, was included in New Media-New Forms. Merging as- 
pects of painting and sculpture, Odalisk incorporates a stuffed 
rooster and a bed pillow as well as images taken from magazines 
and art postcards. Describing Rauschenberg's work, Cage stated, 
"There is no more subject in a combine than there is in a page 
from a newspaper. . . It is a situation involving multiplicity" 97 
Leo Steinberg also likened the "radically new orientation" of a 
Rauschenberg Combine to a newspaper." in which the painted 
surface is no longer the analogue of a visual experience of 
nature." Steinberg compared the "flatbed picture plane" of a 
Combine to "bulletin boards . . . any receptor surface on which 
objects are scattered, on which data is entered." 98 This surface 
where juxtaposed pieces of visual information accumulate, 
rather than a window into which space recedes, bears compari- 
son to the collage effect of Rosenquist's paintings. Quite distinct 
from Rauschenberg, however, was Rosenquist's interest in how 
the found image evolves when translated to oil on canvas, rather 
than in the found object per se. 

Johns's flags and targets, which he began painting in the 
mid-1950s, came closer to Rosenquist's approach; one. Target 
with Plaster Casts (1955), was included in New Media-New Forms 
(see fig. 33). Johns said he chose the targets for their banalit) 
they were "things the mind already knows" and thus gave him 
"room to work on other levels." 99 This is comparable to Rosen- 
quist's selection of slightly out-of-date advertisements — known 
images stored in the collective unconscious — which he felt 
would not detract from his formal concerns. Painted in oil and 
encaustic on a base of newspaper, Johns fastidiously remade 
readymade images by hand, just as Rosenquist would remake 
his subjects taken from mass-media sources. 

The New Media-New Forms exhibitions and The Art of 
Assemblage acknowledged the lineage from collage and assem- 
blage to the artist-made environments and Happenings that 
began in the late 1950s. The originator of Happenings, Allan 
Kaprow, who was represented in New Media-New Forms by a 
mixed-media work and a catalogue text, tied this lineage to 
Abstract Expressionism. 1 "" In his influential article "The Legacy 
of lackson Pollock." published in 1958, Kaprow argued that

Action Painting had opened art up to the infiltration of everyday 
experience and materials, and within the large-scale canvases, 
the artist became like a performer. 101 In essence, this was an ex- 
pansion upon Harold Rosenberg's argument that in Abstract 
Expressionism, "the canvas began to appear ... as an arena," 
and "the painter has become an actor." 102 Pollock's "mural-scale 
paintings," Kaprow wrote, "ceased to become paintings and be- 
came environments ... the painting is continued on out into the 
room . . . Pollock . . . left us at the point where we must become 
preoccupied with and even dazzled by the space and objects of 
our everyday life, either our bodies, clothes, rooms, or, if need be, 
the vastness of Forty-Second Street ... all will become materials 
for this new concrete art." 103 In the early 1960s, Rosenquist at- 
tended several Happenings, staged by Claes Oldenburg and 
Robert Whitman, among others, but found the pace slow be- 
cause of the reliance on real rather than theatrical time. 104 
Rosenquist was better suited to the fast-paced accumulation of 
information available on the streets of New York. 



ROSENQUIST AND COLLAGE 

Rosenquist's earliest extant collage. Untitled (1957, cat. no. 148), 
is a compendium of historical references to collage, while incor- 
porating elements and motifs that have remained characteristic 
of his art to the present day. Cubism is invoked in several ways. 
The collage pieces are distributed in a rough-hewn, invisible grid 
and pushed forward in the picture plane, rather than receding in 
depth through an imaginary window. The faux-bois, in the lower 
left, could be a direct reference to the wood-grain wallpaper 
used by Georges Braque in his early papier colles to indicate 
the "color and texture of wood [without] the distortions of 
chiaroscuro and perspective l(l ' Untitled was apparently not 
made as a study for a painting, but Rosenquist would later mas- 
terfully depict in oil the trompe-l'oeil effect of wood grain in 
such paintings as Horse Blinders (1968-69, cat. no. 71). As in a 
Schwitters collage, fragments are pasted to the very edge of the 
picture plane, and light and dark, torn and straight-edge 
fragments, recognizable images, blocks of pure color, word frag- 
ments, and visual fragments are carefully balanced within the 
composition. 106 The girdle and the inverted torso evoke the Sur- 
realists' use of the truncated body and refer directly to the frag- 
mented hands, legs, and faces that appear regularly in the 
advertisements that served as Rosenquist's sources. Life maga- 
zine's characteristic logo is printed on the packaging for Pedigree 
pencils, which is among the pencil imagery included in Untitled 
and points ahead to the rows of pencils that appear in many ot 
Rosenquist's later works such a^ / eaky Ride lor Dr. Leakey (1983. 
cat. no. 100) and Space Dust (1989. cat. no. 270). "&gt; 7 

Among the first paintings Rosenquist worked on at the Coen- 
ties Slip studio were President Elect and Zone (1960-61. cat. no. 4). 
The paintings, and the related preparatory works (cat. nos. 152 
and 149). displayed methods and introduced motifs that have re- 
curred in the artist's work for much of his career. A look at his 
paintings in light of the actual sources and the preparatory col- 
lages reveals how significantly he manipulated and transformed 
borrowed materials. The collage for President Elect is derived 
from varied sources: the head shot of John F. Kennedy is 
cropped from a 1960 campaign poster, while the hand and 
cake and the car come from advertisements reproduced in Life 
magazine— the former from one for Swans Down Devil's Food

Mix in 1954 (fig. 39), and the latter from a double-page adver- 
tisement for the "New Chevrolet for "49." 108 The subject, ren- 
dered on Masonite — billboard material — and measuring about 
eight by twelve feet makes this painting, at first glance, the most 
like a "regular billboard" of any of Rosenquist's subsequent 
works. 109 The melding together in paint of the images and the 
juxtaposition of such disparate subjects, however, makes the 
work far less immediately legible. Kennedy was the first presi- 
dential candidate to fully utilize the mass media to advance his 
publicity, and the painting is about "a man advertising him- 
self." 110 Rosenquist captured the media's leveling of subject 
matter by giving equal play to each section of his tripartite com- 
position. He brought the Kennedy image to the fore by changing 
the black-and-white head shot of the poster to vivid color in the 
painting. Inversely, the hand and cake, which are in full color in 
Life, are painted in grisaille. Only a small, highly characteristic de- 
tail of the car is included in the painting, but it retains the original 
colors of the advertisement: cream against a red ground. The pa- 
triotic colors of this work find a source in the original colors of the 
campaign poster, in which Kennedy's black-and-white image is 
placed against red, white, and blue stripes; 111 Rosenquist shifted 
the colors horizontally, running them along the bottom of the 
painting. By omitting advertising text on the surface of his paint- 
ing and zeroing in on his subjects — the close-up of Kennedy's face 
cut just above the eyes, the point of contact between hand and 
cake, and the rounded form of the front right tire and fender of an 
out-of-date Chevrolet — Rosenquist extracts the crucial, visual in- 
formation from his sources to disclose the most about his subject. 
A similar process of simplification and color change oc- 
curred for / Love You with My Ford (1961. cat. no. 8) for which a 
simple collage (cat. no. 150) exists. In the full-page advertise- 
ment in Life that served as the source for the fender, a bright-red 
1950 Ford is centered, flanked by a female model and several 
vignettes of the car in various colors (fig. 40). The advertisement 
itself is a photomontage, not atypical for advertising in the United 
States, even before World War II. 112 In the final painting, the 
artist zeroed in on the fender, rendered it close-up, in black-and- 
white, and ran it across the full width of the painting, constituting 
the middle rung of the three-part composition. The other two 
tiers would have had readymade source images as well. 113 



President Elect raises the issue of celebrity, a recurrent theme 
through the mid-1960s for Rosenquist and many other artists, 
including Ray Johnson, de Kooning, Rauschenberg, and Andy 
Warhol. As Rosenquist said, "I was fascinated by how people 
advertise themselves." 11 - 4 Celebrity itself is constructed and sus- 
tained through media attention, and he introduced this subject 
into his work through his magazine sources. The source image 
(cat. no. 160) for Untitled ( Joan Crawford Says...) (1964, cat. no. 48) 
is a magazine clipping cropped to include only the star's face, 
framed by a white horizontal rectangle containing her signature 
and red vertical rectangle containing the severed words of her 
product endorsement. 115 The painting makes clear that it is not 
what "Joan Crawford says" but her face primarily and her name 
secondarily that are the key to the advertisement's effective- 
ness. 116 The otiginal advertisement for Camel cigarettes in a 1951 
issue o(Life is itself a visually complicated montage; it comprises 
several overlapping squares containing a variety of images and 
typefaces (fig. 41). Beyond the recognizable images, however. 
Rosenquist's painting is a formal study of color and shape the 
vertical block of red is picked up by Crawford's dress, while the 
white echoes the shades of the elegant room in which she stands 
In another celebrity portrait by Rosenquist, Marilyn Monroe I 
(1962, cat. no. 23), montage remains integral to the painted com- 
position. As in the portraits and collages of the Cubists, the face 
and the words "Marilyn" and "Coca-Cola" are fractured. Again, 
celebrity and commodity are on equal footing. 117 

More typically, the celebrities from Rosenquist's magazine 
sources are rendered anonymous in his paintings Their easy 
identification would run contrary to his effort to keep his images 
neutral, without "the face [they come] closer to what is histori- 
cally the look of abstract painting." 118 For example, Rosenquist's 
first work in his media-derived style, 1947, 1948, 1950 (1960), a 
work for which no maquette survives, is based on a human in- 
terest story in a 1951 issue of Life on the subject of President 
Harry Truman's transformation into a "clotheshorse." 119 Rosen- 
quist extracted three images from a grid of twelve close-up views 
charting Truman's neckwear from 1938 to 1951. Independent of 
head or body, the ties function metonymically to suggest the 
man behind them. The grid, a form favored by the magazine's 
graphic designers for feature articles and by its advertisers, is a

format Rosenquist often used in the 1960s as a starting point for 
more complicated compositions. This work, however, retains the 
grid, as well as the black and white, of the magazine layout. 12 " 

The subject of celebrity and anonymity is taken up again in 
4-1949 Guys (1962, cat. no. 22) and its preparatory collage (fig. 42). 
This work is based on a cigarette advertisement that ran in a 
1949 issue of Life (fig. 43). Here, "The Top Men in Sports" — the 
1949 guys — endorse Chesterfields; holding cigarettes and attrib- 
utes of their sport. Lou Boudreau. Ben Hogan, Joe DiMaggio, 
Jack Kramer, and Frankie Albert are framed in a multicolored 
grid on a spread. 121 In the collage. Rosenquist excluded Albert 
and shuffled the remaining four squares to create different color 
and formal pairings. He rendered the athletes anonymous by 
rubbing out their faces and taping strips of white paper over the 
midsections of the images. In the final painting, it is gestures 
and, in most cases, colors that are retained from the advertise- 
ment. The identities are further obscured: Boudreau's face is 
covered by a gray cloudy form; Hogan is entirely replaced by an 
ice-cream cone, tipped in the same posture as he is in the adver- 
tisement; superimposed over DiMaggio*s head is the butt of a 
rifle rendered in grisaille; and covering Kramer's face is a frag- 
ment of a man leaning on his fist. The last is only a sliver of 
information — bent fingers pressed into the temple of a short- 
haired subject — also in grisaille. The forms are so out of context 
that at first the composition is illegible, almost abstract, but 
"after that glimpse, there's the follow-up," allowing the imagery 
to be read but not synthesized into a narrative 

Up From the Ranks (1961, cat. no. 155), a collage that was never 
realized as a painting, has many similarities to the collage for 
4-/949 Guys to which it is related. Rosenquist again chose as his 
source an advertisement with a grid consisting of male busts, 
this time showing presidents of companies in the Bell System 
The clipped words, "Up From the Ranks," were the advertise- 
ment's heading. 122 Again Rosenquist rearranged the squares and 
erased the faces of the executives, who in the advertisement are 
shown with their names and a brief resume printed below their 
portraits. It is presumably this piece that Rosenquist described 
in an interview: "When something caught my eye, I would 
attach it to the wall. I saw a picture of telephone executives in 
a magazine, so I erased all their faces. They looked like eggs in a 



carton. It was a kind of autobiographical answer to 'What am I 
doing here?'" 123 Instead of making a painting from this collage, 
however, he worked on the paintings 4-1949 Guys and 4 Young 
Revolutionaries (1962. cat. no. 21). 124 

The sketch and source image (cat. no. 149) for Zone are re- 
vealing regarding the painting's history and chronology. From 
the time he began working on it in late 1960 until its completion 
in 1961, large sections were painted over, and the iconography 
was significantly simplified. As shown in and described on the 
drawing, the painting had included, "3 swimming cows," "babies 
[sic] mouth intersecting mama." "salt shaking on shirt," and 
"blood [that] turns into [the] American Flag." The title refers to 
"a place in the mind," where "like in archaeology things are 
covered up." 125 Although no longer explicit, the covered images 
continued to play a conceptual role in the finished painting, 
which has been pared down to only two images. The frag- 
mented head and hands of a woman are immediately readable 
in the upper right, while in the foreground, on the left, is a slice 
of tomato that dominates the painting in scale; it is magnified 
nearly to the point of abstraction and the viewer identifies it 
last. 126 The source for the woman is a black-and-white adver- 
tisement for Pond's Angel Skin hand lotion that was copyrighted 
in 1961. thus indicating that this portion of the sketch and paint- 
ing was not part of the original conception. 127 

Rosenquist called Zone "the beginning of my thinking"; it 
"was like zero." Introducing actual images did away with the 
risk in nonobjective painting that unintended imagery would 
surface. Grisaille, he explained, had often served as a starting 
point for many artists "because they wanted to start from an 
empty place." 128 The omission of bright colors, for the Cubists, 
for example, focused attention on the contour and structure of 
the objects represented. And while this formal imperative is ap- 
plicable to Rosenquist. the use of gray, black, and white in his 
paintings, as it often was in Cubist compositions, was deter- 
mined by the colors of the media sources. One is reminded of 
yet another "Zone," a poem written by Apollinaire in 1912 just 
before Picasso began using newspaper clippings in collages. This 
poem takes the reader through city streets and lauds the adver- 
tising media that defines the modern urban environment: "You 
read the handbills, catalogues, posters that sing out loud and

clear — / That's the morning's poetry, and for prose there are the 
newspapers." 129 It is by way of appropriation that the power and 
modern-day "poetry" and "prose" of advertising is translated 
into Rosenquist's painting. 

The hands-to-face gesture of the woman in the Pond's ad- 
vertisement and Rosenquist's Zone is what Erving Goffman 
called "the feminine touch," a "just barely touching" gesture, 
which is "distinguished from the utilitarian kind that grasps, 
manipulates, or holds." 130 It is a gesture that, by way of mass- 
media sources. Rosenquist used often but always only in a 
partial view, as in his Woman I. Goffman observed that this kind 
of "self-touching" can convey "a sense of one's body being a del- 
icate and precious thing." 131 The laughing woman provides the 
visual counterpart to the advertising text, which is characteristi- 
cally omitted from Rosenquist's painting. The advertisement 
promises "young hands" to the faithful user: "young hands are 
happy hands. Lovely to look at. Like a laughing face. Tempting 
to touch. And exciting to kiss." Text and image collude to prom- 
ise youth, happiness, loveliness, and desirability. 132 

Regarding his sources, Rosenquist definitively said, "I wasn't 
glorifying popular imagery," and "I didn't love this imagery." 133 
He was, however, savvy to the highly effective powers of com- 
munication that advertisers have and understood how he could 
apply this to his own work. In a 1964 interview, he explained, 
"I geared myself, like an advertiser ... to this visual inflation — 
in commercial advertising which is one of the foundations of our 
society. I'm living in it, and it has such impact and excitement in 
its means of imagery. Painting is probably more exciting than 
advertising — so why shouldn't it be done with that power and 
gusto, with that impact." He went on to say. "My metaphor . . . 
is my relations to the power of commercial advertising which is 
in turn related to our free society . . . When I use a combination 
of fragments of things, the fragments ... are caustic to one an- 
other." 134 In Zone, collage is a formal conceit and also a critique 
of the numbing effects of advertising. 135 

For Rosenquist, it is the fragments or collage aesthetic — the 
bringing together of "caustic" elements — that dismantles 
the original intention of the advertiser. The jagged intrusion of 
the tomato across the woman's face wipes away the allure of the 
laughing mouth. Instead, the mouth is disfigured, rendered

grotesque and threatening, as in de Kooning's Woman I and the 
disembodied toothy mouths cut from fashion magazines in 
Rosenquist's women and flowers series from the 1980s — such as 
The Persistence of Electrical Nymphs in Space (1985, cat. no. 106) 
and the related collage (cat. no. 187) — for which Zone must be 
understood as a precursor. 1V ' 

The body part — here, the abbreviated view of hand and 
face — is a recurrent motif in Rosenquist's work through the 
1980s. His interest was not in the whole object, but "the part 
of the object . . . that's the emphasis. And where the emphasis 
ilso where the emotions, the color and everything 
else is." IV7 Body parts, both in advertising and in Rosenquist's 
paintings, are loaded images, conveying as much about what is 
missing — what lies beyond the advertisement or edge of the 
canvas — as what is included. In discussing the fragmented fe- 
male legs in Edouard Manet's Masked Ball at the Opera (1873), 
Linda Nochlin observed that they "can be read ... as fetish" 
and "can function metonymically. as synecdoches or part images 
of the body as a whole, references to the sexual attractiveness of 
the invisible owner." Nochlin noted that Manet was drawing 
from "'low' or 'popular' artists" and that "Modernism . . . 
has consistently renewed itself with strategies particular 
to popular or 'low' art since the mid-nineteenth century and 
continues to do so . . . to the present day."" 8 Rosenquist's 



borrowings from advertising should be understood in this spirit 
of aesthetic renewal. 

McLuhan observed in his 1951 critique of the media. The Me- 
chanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man, how it was typical of 
postwar advertising techniques to use body parts metonymi- 
cally to provide information by implication about what is not 
seen. Commenting on the female legs displayed on a pedestal in 
a Gotham hosiery advertisement, he remarked that when the 
legs are "abstracted from the body that gives them their ordi- 
nary meaning, . . . [they] become 'something more than sex,' 
a metaphysical enticement, a cerebral itch, an abstract tor- 
ment." 139 Female legs retain their function as fetish in advertis- 
ing, and they retain this aspect in Rosenquist's paintings as well, 
for example, in Brighta than the Sun (fig. 45), Pushbutton 
(cat. no. 5), and The Light That Won't Fail I (cat. no. 7), all from 
1961. Amid fragmented, enlarged, and abstracted imagery, in 
Brighter than the Sun, one can decipher crossed legs clad in 
seamed stockings, which the preparatory collage reveals were 
based on a Burlington Mills advertisement for Cameo stockings 
(fig. 44). 140 The advertisers code for sensuality is employed by 
Rosenquist in The Light That Won't Fail 1 and Pushbutton by the 
female legs grazing one against the other. 141 The preparatory 
collage (cat. no. 154) for Pushbutton makes explicit the link in 
advertising between technology, cars specifically, and sex: 142 the 
push buttons are derived from a Philco automobile radio adver- 
tisement in a 1947 issue of Life, and the artist has written in the 
margin, "Push my button what turns me on." 143 

While women's legs appear repeatedly in Rosenquist's work 
in the early 1960s, 144 fragmented male legs appear as well. As re- 
vealing and packed with visual and sociological information as 
their female counterpart, male legs, however, signify quite differ- 
ently from them and also from each other. In Look Alive (Blue 
Feet, Look Alive), the trousered legs and black shoes could 
belong to a well-groomed businessman, while the collage (cat. 
no. 179) for Early in Morning (1963. cat. no. 34) reveals that 
the baggy pants and bare feet were taken from a clipping cap- 
tioned: "His body a study of rhythmic rage, a Durban negro 
hurls stones at window of an Indian shop." Men's feet, as in In 
the Red (1962, cat. no. 17) and The Promenade of Merc e Cunning- 
ham (1963, cat. no. 36, and the related collage, cat. no. 159), by

actually supporting weight, also appear to be more functional 
than women's. The feet at the center of the tribute to choreog- 
rapher Cunningham are moving, as if dancing. Rosenquist de- 
scribed the image as "somebody doing something naturally . . . 
very carelessly accurate. You see it in Merce's dance. His body 
movement looks so careless but it was so perfect." 145 That Cun- 
ningham's dance had a mundane urban connection is reinforced 
by the source for the shoes; it is taken from a photograph by Life 
photographer Burt Glinn, who snapped candids of New Yorkers 
having their shoes shined (fig. 46). ,46 

Disembodied hands are featured prominently in Rosen- 
quist's work from this early period, as in Pushbutton and Flower 
Garden (1961, cat. no. 6). Isolated hands are also found fre- 
quently in the work of de Chirico and the Surrealists, especially 
Ernst. 147 Werner Spies interpreted the collage hands in Ernst's 
Loplop series of the 1930s as stand-ins for the hand of the artist. 
Collage is an act that is more cerebral — about selection — than 
manual; it is not handmade in the traditional sense. Spies sug- 
gested that in Ernst the "severed hand may be taken as an 
emblem of collage, for estrangement, for the tearing of things 
from their usual context." 148 

Paul Berg's photograph (fig. 1) of Rosenquist in his Coenties 
Slip studio in 1961 surrounded by his paintings Zone, Flower 
Garden, and Pushbutton suggests that the hands are not about 
the artists as the maker of collage (the choosing hand) versus 
the creator of paintings (the originating hand). Instead, as the 



Berg photograph indicates, Rosenquist focused on contrasting 
forms, showing hands at different levels of tension, and revealing 
the friction between the forms. In all three paintings, grisaille, de- 
rived from Rosenquist's magazine sources, serves to sharpen the 
focus on form. Flower Garden is based on two unrelated black- 
and-white images in the same 1954 issue of Life but which were 
not side-by-side in the magazine. In the collage study (cat. 
no. 153), the artist drew flowers growing from the female 
hands — the fingers having metamorphosed conceptually into 
stems. The magazine clipping, on the left, shows portions of the 
torso, arm, and leg of an athlete. Even without knowledge of the 
complete photograph (fig. 47), the fragment is sufficient to iden- 
tify a runner after a race: the drooping arm, the muscular male 
leg that bears no weight, the running shorts, and the number on 
the sleeveless shirt. The image comes from a photo essay in Li/fe 
about the surprise win of Roger Bannister, who in 1954 ran the 
first sub-four-minute mile; the caption reads, "Triumph finally 
takes its toll as Bannister sags unconscious." 149 John Sadovy's 
photograph has the pathos of a Renaissance deposition, with a 
group of men, like Christ-bearers, supporting the athlete's 
swooning body. All this emotion is retained in the detail ex- 
tracted by Rosenquist. 150 The three hands standing erect are 




BLAUT I COLLAGE ANO THE PAINTING OF MODERN LIFE 



from an advertisement for Playtex Gloves (fig. 48). 151 By silhou- 
etting the grisaille forms of the athlete and hands against a 
unified dark ground, the artist successfully merged the painting's 
left and right zones. 

Beginning in 1961 and continuing into the 1990s, real objects 
have occasionally been incorporated into Rosenquist's paintings, 
pushing the aspect of two-dimensional collage in the direction of 
three-dimensional assemblage. 152 The objects included, however, 
are not found street objects, but generally help to elucidate the 
nature of the picture plane. In a 1987 interview, the artist stated, 
"The big thing . . . was violating the picture plane by cutting a 
hole in a canvas. That was really sacred. Fontana did it . . . Bob 
Rauschenberg did a lot of crazy things with the sacred picture 
plane. I was curious. I did a painting where 1 mounted little rec- 
tangles in back of a canvas and cut the canvas and upholstered 
it. The painting had a mirror on it and a little box and was 
called Balcony [1961. cat. no. 9]." 153 The addition of a mirror to 
the surface of a canvas is a strategy for exploring the nature of 
the painted surface. In Look Alive (Blue Feet, Look Alwe). the mir- 
ror reflects the viewers' feet, thus inserting them into the picture 
space and making the line between the world within the frame 
and outside of it indistinct. As if to emphasize the object quality 
of his paintings, the artist has sometimes chosen, throughout his 
career, to shape his canvases, as for example in Air Hammer 
(1962, cat. no. 30) and The Swimmer in the Econo-mist (painting 3) 
(1997-98, cat. no. 136). Much like a Johns flag or target, the shaped 
canvas essentially becomes the thing represented. 

As Rosenquist stated in 1968: "I enjoy the frailty and thick- 
ness of canvas, because when you look at it from its edge its hard 
to imagine what's on the surface." 15,4 Indeed, the small canvas 
panels attached to a group of works from 1962 and 1963 — 
including Untitled (Blue Sky) (1962, cat. no. 29) , Capillary Action 
(1962, cat. no. 32), and Untitled (Two Chairs) (1963. cat. no. 33)— 
enhance the actual flatness of the larger canvas from which they 
project and of the images depicted illusionistically in paint. 
Rosenquist stated that these paintings are "about randomness. I 
took a big canvas and threw things on them at random." 155 Em- 
bracing the "encounter with an accident," was something 
Rosenquist observed in Rauschenberg's art, 156 and is characteris- 
tic of Dada. Abstract Expressionism, and Happenings, but is 



atypical for his own carefully planned work. The grids for scal- 
ing up the images to larger-than-life size are evident in the 
source images (fig. 49 and cat. no. 178) for both Capillary Action 
and Untitled (Two Chairs), and the artist made notations about 
his plans to add small canvases to the surface, although the 
placements of the canvases remain unspecified. 1,17 For Untitled 
(Two Chairs), Rosenquist penciled in circles to indicate the shape 
of the small panels, but in the final painting, the circles, which 
are painted white, are dispersed elsewhere against the white of 
the canvas. Rosenquist described making Capillary Action. 
"I painted the tree and I just tossed canvases on the painting 
[which was on the floor] and where they fell. I fixed them . 
and painted them the same color as the background . . . Where 
they fell accidentally they fell. You call that art or just an acci- 
dent? What makes it art and not an accident?" 158 

While both works address formal concerns, Capillary Action 
and Untitled (Two Chairs) also comment on media culture. Take, 
for example, the disingenuousness of the text advertising 
Kroehler "cushionized" furniture on which Untitled (Two Chairs) 
is based: "an inspiration ... so refreshingly new! ... Its beauty is 
breath-taking." While Rosenquist omitted the text from the col- 
lage and finished painting, its irony remains. Speaking about 
this painting, he said he "wanted to set up a conflict between 
something as blatant and vulgar as the chairs and elements as 
abstract as the circles." 159 He replaced advertising copy with ele- 
gant, but empty, white-on-white canvases 

Capillary Action addresses both abstraction in art and the 
artificiality of the pastoral myth invoked in contemporary cul- 
ture. The artist explained his impetus for making this work, as 
well as the related sculptural assemblage Capillary Action II 
(1963. cat no 42): "I saw a photograph of a meadow with a tree 
standing in the middle. I couldn't get that image out of my 
mind, where it kept flashing on and off — extremely artificial in 
one phase and then completely natural again. This experience 
made me aware of a startling aspect of our present landscape in 
which nature becomes increasingly modified by man until the 
natural and artificial blend into each other. This awareness 
prompted the creation of an artwork that could somehow proj- 
ect these two opposite feelings — naturalness and artificiality." 1 "" 
Equally contrived is Capillary Action's specific source image —

a Rinso detergent advertisement — in which humanity, (a blonde, 
sweater-clad family), and nature (a wooly sheep and a green 
tree), are in perfect harmony. As Martin Green observed, in an 
increasingly technology-driven and sophisticated society, the 
nostalgic yearning for the pastoral past, the myth of a lost Eden, 
is as powerful as ever. 161 

Having extracted the people and sheep from the finished 
work, Rosenquist achieved a new contrived balance. He has said 
that the work is about "seeing abstraction everywhere, looking 
at a landscape and seeing abstraction." The superimposed 
rectangles become like small Color Field paintings in shades of 
gray and green, from the earthiest to the most artificial tones, 
establishing the dialogue between nature and culture. 162 Fur- 
thermore, the handmade painting, in contrast to the readymade 
source image, is emphasized by the green panel in the upper- 
right quadrant of the painting, where Rosenquist uncharacteris- 
tically splashed paint over the small rectangle, and the rough 
ground of newspaper and tape. 

An element of chance plays a role also in paintings from 
1963 such as Morning Sun (cat. no. 37) and Nomad (cat. no. 40), 
which both incorporate plastic sheets draped over portions of 
the canvas. In writing about works of 1962-63 that included 




"extraneous materials," Lippard described the fugitive effect of 
light and air on the plastic, which in turn changes the 
appearance of the canvas: "|The] plastic drop sheet, either trans- 
parent or vertically dripped with paint [as in Morning Sun and 
Nomad] . . . acted upon the canvas below and combined visually 
to make new colors, providing a shifting chromatic screen 
through which that area of the painting changed continually, 
and adding a capricious dimension subject to the breeze or light 
in the room." 163 The dripped paint may be an homage to the 
gestural paint application of the Abstract Expressionists, 164 but 
the artist made sketches to carefully plan the drips, and in Morn- 
ing Sun, the striations of paint on the plastic are so regular as to 
approximate the peanut wrapping in Taxi (1964). Rosenquist in- 
dicated that Nomad refers to his travels before he came to New 
York and includes autobiographical references to that period — 
snatches of advertising imagery and a picnic table, things seen 
along a stretch of highway. 165 The dripped paint, however, also al- 
ludes to Rosenquist's stylistic wanderings as an artist, for at the 
same time that he was "on the move" during the early 1950s, he 
was still an abstract painter, a nomad who was yet to reach his 
signature style. 

The multiple, ever-changing identity of the picture plane is 
most directly addressed in Forest Ranger (1967, e.g., cat. no. 68), 
a group of works Rosenquist painted on Mylar, sliced into strips, 
and hung from the ceiling, allowing the viewer to walk through 
the image. Rosenquist described these as "walk through" paint- 
ings and sculpture. 166 Tommaso Trini described the effect of 
being "inside": "In Forest Ranger ... art and life are divided no 
more than by a moving sliced diaphragm . Now the whole 
body and all of the senses can penetrate where once only the 
eyes passed." 167 The picture plane appears to have completely 
disappeared in the performative installation works from 1970, 
Horizon Home Sweet Home (cat. no. 73) and Slush Thrust, where 
fog from a dry-ice machine fills a room whose walls are covered 
by monochrome, high-color, and silver panels. The painted and 
Mylar panels are fully visible, except during the intervals when 
the room is filled with dry-ice fog and the picture plane dissolves 
entirely from view. 168

Silo (1963-64), is an assemblage or could be described as a Com- 
bine, in its merging of painting and sculpture. In an exhibition 
re\ lew, Max Kozloff described Candidate as a "montage" that 
extended "past the stage of an agglomeration into that of 
environment." 169 Although Rauschenberg only made technical 
drawings for his most complicated Combines, Rosenquist, as is 
typical for him. planned his composition in advance. The source 
image (fig. 51) from a Camel "T-Zone" advertisement remained 
fully recognizable in Candidate, where it provided a backdrop for 
three-dimensional objects. ,7U A see-through "T." made from 
Perspex and illuminated with a lightbulb, covered the woman's 
mouth and throat; enclosed within the "T-Zone'' was a chair 
with a pan of water holding fake Day-Glo-colored flowers. 
The artificiality of Rosenquist's advertising source was reinforced 
by his choice of artificial materials and colors. Candidate, he ex- 
plained, was a statement about the bombardment and numbing 
effect of advertising imagery; the chair, which he considered al- 
lowing viewers to use. was meant as "a seat for brainwashing." 171 



For Silo, first shown later in 1964 at the Dwan Gallery. Los Ange- 
les, the artist removed the chair, pan. and flowers and painted 
an abstract blue field in place of the upper portion of the 
woman's face. The "T-Zone" had been transformed from a 
pleasure zone to a "silo," a place where fodder is fermented to 
produce animal feed. 172 

Rosenquist's paintings from the 1960s established him as a Pop 
artist certainly but also as an artist who has continued the tradi- 
tion of twentieth-century collage. His focus on collage began 
around 1960 when it presented new possibilities to artists in 
New York who were seeking ways to reconnect art with every- 
day existence. In his 1930 essay "La peinture au defi," Louis 
Aragon argued that collage in the early twentieth century was 
done in "in defiance of painting " Written for the catalogue of a 
collage exhibition held at Galerie Goemans in Paris, the essay 
maintained that collage— by its disintegration of boundaries be- 
tween media and by its insertion of the everyday into the sphere 
of - art — represented a break from the hallowed tradition of 
painting. 173 Rosenquist's collaged maquettes. by contrast, are lit- 
erally done in the service of painting. Working in the postwar 
period in the United States, he has applied the structure of col- 
lage — the cut up — to oil on canvas. His collage aesthetic, made 
either with pasted fragments from magazines or translated 
into paint, however, ultimately broaches similar questions to 
those posed by artists working at the beginning of the last cen- 
tury regarding modernist art and the subjects of mass culture. 
At intervals throughout his career. Rosenquist has made history 
paintings on a monumental scale— from Mil to The Swimmer in 
the Econo-mist (1997-98, cat. nos. 136-38)— but these are history 
paintings with an eye to the epic quality of genre, of the small, 
everyday subjects that add up to a portrait of a moment in time. 
As he has said, he is 'interested in contemporary vision— the 
flicker of chrome, reflections, rapid associations, quick flashes of 
light." 174 To borrow the words of Baudelaire, Rosenquist's paint- 
ings reveal him to be a "painter of the passing moment and all 
the suggestions of eternity that it contains."

cussing them with me, answering questions and, 
inevitably, raising new ones.

5. Rosenquist has frequently used the term 
"below zero" to describe his push beyond the ex- 
ample of abstract painting. For example, in an in- 
terview with Peter Schjeldahl, Rosenquist said: "I 
thought abstract painting was about trying to 
make zero, to make nothing . Then I had a feel- 
ing from my billboard experience that maybe by 
using imagery I could go below zero" Quoted in 
Schjeldahl. "An Interview with James Rosenquist," 
Opus International no. 29-30 (Dec. 1971). p. 114.

6. Rosenquist. conversation with the author, May 31, 
2002 His focus on formal issues, even once he had 
reintroduced figuration around 1960, gave Rosen- 
quist's work a similar emphasis as abstract art ot 
the period, such as that by the first and second 
g&lt; neratlon Abstract Expressionists and by his Co- 
enties Slip neighbor Ellsworth Kelly. Rosenquist 
has returned to abstract painting periodically 
throughout his career, for example, in Horizon 
Home Sweet Home (1970, cat. no 73) and the Speed 
of Light series (1999-2001). as in The Stowaway Peers

9 Rosenquist stated that images from the recent 
past "have the least value of anything I could use 
and still be an image, because recent history seems 
unremembered and anonymous while current 
events arc bloody and passionate and older his- 
tory is categorized and nostalgic " Rosenquist, 
quoted in Lippard. "lames Rosenquist: Aspects of

sioned Works (Stockholm: Paintets Posters in asso- 
ciation with Wetterling Gallery. 1990), p. 41 The 
"glimpse" is comparable to the term "vernacular 
glance" used by Brian O'Doherty to describe the 
work of Robert Rauschenberg: "The vernacular 
glance is what catries us through the citj 
day — a mode of almost unconscious or at least di- 
vided attention. Since we are usually moving, it tags 
the unexpected and quickly makes it familiar it 
is almost disinterested. This is the opposite of the 
pastoral nineteenth-century walk,' where habitual 
curiosity provoked wonder It is superficial in 
the best sense." O'Doherty, "Rauschenberg and

"preparatory" collage is used by the artist to refer 
to multiple images brought together and glued to a 
paper support; "source image" is employed to refi I 
to a single image used as inspiration for a painting

16. In conversation with the author. Apr 19, 2002. 
Rosenquist mentioned that he found the back is- 
sues of Life magazine at the home of his firsi M Ifi 
mother. In 1964, Rosenquist said, "I use images 
from old magazines I mean 1945 to 1955 — 
a time we haven't started to ferret out as histi n s 
yet " G[ene) R Swenson, "What is Pop Art' 
Part II: Stephen Durkee, Jasper Johns I tmi 
Rosenquist, Tom Wesselman," Art News 62 no 10 
(Feb. 1964), p. 41 In fact, some of the magazine 
sources are more contemporary with the paint- 
ings Other magazines also served as sources; in 
the 1980s, for example, Rosenquist used fashion 
magazines such as Vogue. Glamour, and Harper's 
Bazaar One impetus for starting to use his own 
photographs as source material in 1966 were the 
lawsuits brought against Andy Warhol for the use 
of other photographers' work in his silkscreened 
paintings. Rosenquist has observed that Warhol's 
method of using a photographic means of repro- 
ducing an image, such as silkscreen, is an entirely 
different process from his own technique, which 
requires the ability to closely copy an original by 
hand. Rosenquist. conversation with the author,

lett, "William [effett in Convetsation with lames

Rosenquist. conversation with the author, May 31, 
2002. In 1964, he stated, "I treat the billboard image 
as it is, so apart from nature. I paint it as a repro- 
duction of other things. I try to get as far away from 

nature as possible" Rosenquist, quoted in 
Swenson. "What is Pop Art"' Part II. p 63.

terview with |ames Rosenquist, In The Metropoli- 
tan Museum of Art Bulletin 26, no. 7 (Mar 1968). 
p 285 He said that selling it in parts "would 
give the idea to people of collecting fragrm I 
vision" Although Leo Castelli, Rosenquist's dealer 



at the time, sold the painting in "one chunk the 
artist thought th.ii "the original intention is still 
den The picture is in parts" (pp. 285, 287). One 
collage (cat. no. 176) indicates the plan, as ll would 
be realized, for wrapping the eighty-six-foot -lone 
painting around the walls of the Leo Castelli 
Gallery. New York, where it was first shown in 
1965; another (cat no 164) shows a discarded plan 
to put "aluminum cylinders" representing stacks 
of Kennedy half dollars" into the center of the

American advertisement (Life 29, no 12, Sept. 18,

Field (1964). but in F-Jll the artist turned it ninety 
degrees. 

30. For one collage (cat. no 173). a piece of poly- 
ester film, sprayed Day-Glo red, is superimposed 
on a plate of spaghetti torn from a magazine; on it 
the artist has written "radio active Spag" revealing 
that Day-Glo indicates radioactivity Similar!) in 
another (64.S23). Rosenquist used cut alu- 
minum — the negative space indicating the tail of 
the plane — in an area that in the final work is 
painted silver and patterned by a wallpaper roller 
to indicate "atomic fallout " Rosenquist, conversa- 
tion with the authot, Apr. 19, 2002 

31. See Hales, "Imagining the Atomic Age: Life 
and the Atom." pp. 108-13 Rosenquist said he 
used "mostly brush and paint, antique methods

duce new spectrums " Richard F Shephard, "To 
What Lengths Can Art Go?" New York- Times, May 
13, 1965, p 39 (published in another edition under 
rhe title "Painting Needs Hall. Not Wall") The 
notations on several studies (cat nos 165 and 167) 
indicate that the Day-glo went over oil in case the 
"day-glo fades" A look at F-IM, nearly four 
decades after it was painted, shows that the Day- 
Glo colors still glow with an aura of radioactivity

"Pop" in the mid-1950s. He and a group of col- 
leagues at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 
London — among them, architectural historian 
Reynor Banham and architects Peter and Alison 
Smithson— first used Pop to refer to the products 
Of mass production and then to describe the work 
of British artists who incorporated American pop- 
ular culture into their work

tine Poggi, in Defiance of Pauiune Cubism, Futur- 
ism, and the invention of Collage (New Haven Vale 
Univetsity Press. 1992), begins with a discussion of 
Picasso's first collage and its "legendary status in 
ilu Instory of art as the first deliberately executed 
collage— the first work of fine art . in which ma- 
terials appropriated from everyday life, relatively 



untransformed by the artist, intrude upon the tra- 
ditionally privileged domain of painting . The 
invention of collage put into question prevailing 
notions of how and what works of art represent, ot 
what unifies a work of art, of what materials artists 
may use, it also opened to debate the more recent 
Romantic definition of what constitutes originality 
and authenticity in the work of an" (p 1) 

56. Rosalind E. Krauss saw collage as operating 
"in direct opposition to modernism's search for 
perceptual plenitude and unimpeachable self pres- 
ence Modernism's goal is to objectify the formal 
constituents of a given media " Collage by contrast 
is postmodern, a "contemporaneous alternative to 
modernism." Krauss, "In the Name of Picasso." in 
Krauss, Tlie Originality ot the Avant-Garde and 
Other Modernist Myths (Cambridge: MIT Press, 
1985), pp. 38-39. Christine Poggi wrote that "Cu- 
bism, and especially the invention of collage, has 
traditionally been defined as exemplary of mod- 
ernism's aspiration toward anti-illusionism, purity 
of means, unity, and autonomy," but she "chal- 
lenge(s) this view, focusing instead on the ways 
Cubist collage undermined traditional notions of 
material and stylistic unity, subverted (rather than 
affirmed) the role of the frame and of the pictorial 
ground, and brought the languages of high and 
low culture into a new relationship of exchange." 
Like Krauss. she saw the invention of collage 
as "an alternative to the modernist tradition of 
twentieth-century art." Poggi. In Defiance of Paint- 
ing, pp. xi. 257

58. Sec Poggi. In Defiance of Painting, p. 61. Roger 
Shattuck commented at Tlie Art of Assemblage 
symposium, "The frame of the painting both marks 
and veils the unsettling passage from art to life, 
from painting to reality" Georges Braque, Picasso, 
and other artists introduced ordinary objects into 
paintings, and as a tesult. "the painting is no 
longer a separate entity with internal relationships 
upon which we can comment from afar It comes 
to life as a machine to importune us. to distutb re- 
lationships outside itself, to project its field of force 
around and beyond us." Shattuck, quoted in Joseph

aspect of the transition from collage CO painting in

- Louis Aragon compared the collages of the 
Cubists to those of Ernst: "With Max Ernst col- 
lage . . becomes a poetic procedure, completely 
opposite in its ends to Cubist collage, whose inten- 
tion is purely realistic " Aragon, "Max Ernst, pein- 
tre des illusions" (1923). quoted in Dawn Ades 
Photomontage, rev. and enl. ed. (London Thames 
and Hudson. 1986). p IS In other words, the 
nonart materials utilized by the Cubists enhanced 
the realism of their work 1 am grateful to Walter 
Hopps for sharing his insights with me regarding 
parallels in Ernsts and Rosenquists approaches to 
collage, which he refers to as "visual poetry."

93, Rosenquist, conversation with the author, 
Apr 19, 2002 Discussing second-generation Ab- 
stract Expressionism, Rosenquist commented. 
"Everyone around me was an Abstract Expres- 
sionist, making big smear paintings like de Koon- 
ing s But they seemed superficial to me because I 
knew how to draw really well. But what I was 
doing also seemed superficial because it was com- 
merclal art " Quoted in Goldman, "An Interview 
with lames Rosenquist." p 98 
94 In telephone conversation with the author, 
Mar 26, 2002. Rosenquist referred to de Kooning 
as one of his heroes. With regard to the relation- 
ship of Rosenquists Woman I to de Kooning's, I am 
reminded of Leo Steinberg's discussion of 
Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning Drawing (195 I), 
w here Rauschenberg, with the older artist's per- 
mission, erased a de Kooning drawing See Stein- 
berg . Encounters with Rauschenberg (A lavishly 
Illustrated Lame) (Houston and Chicago: Menil 
Collection and University of Chicago Press. 2000), 
pp 16-22 Steinberg questions if it is "an Oedipal 
gesture? Young Rauschenberg killing the father fig- 
ure' Well, maybe." Rauschenberg indicated by "in- 
direction" that he chose de Kooning as opposed to 
other artists, because de Kooning was an artist he 
related to Similarly Rosenquists Woman I is a 
homage to de Kooning and is indicative of Rosen- 
quist's sense of connection between de Kooning's 
artistic program and his own For a discussion of 
the relationship of Rosenquist's Woman I to 
de Kooning's, see Sidra Stich. Made in US A. In 
Americanization in Modern An. The 50s &amp; 60s

95. Rosenquist "credits his friend. Robert Rauschen- 
berg, with providing encouragement in accepting 
an approach that involved the use of ideas and 
things not ordinarily regarded as appropriate for 
use in the making of art." Donald I Saff, "Rosen- 
quist in Moscow." in Rosenquisi: Moscow 1961-1991.

though environments had been shown in alterna-

113. Rosenquist, conversation with the author, 
May 31, 2002. Many of Rosenquist's renderings of 
food in 1964 show a similar narrowing of focus 
from source to painting. For Fruit Salad (1964), for 
example, he extracted the serving spoon full of 
fruit from a Libby's fruit cocktail advertisement in 
Life and omitted all other written and visual infor- 
mation. The advertisement appears in Life 37, 
no 25, Dec. 20, 1954, p 40 A similar kind of focus 
on detail occurs in White Bread (1964), taken from 
an advertisement that appears repeatedly in Life.

pany Cigarette advettisements, with and without 
celebrities, wete prevalent in the mass media and 
many served as sources for Rosenquist's paintings 
in the early 1960s. The collage (cat. no. 151) for The 
Light That Won't Fail I shows, for example, that a 
magazine clipping ftom a Philip Morris advertise- 
ment is the source for that painting's smoking 
woman, whose packaged sensuality the artist also 
appropriated, the advertisement appears in Life 10,

117 Rosenquist did the painting of Monroe "the 
moment she died 1 did the painting just as quick 
as het life went. A quick idea. Het life was up and

ephemeral, leaf in the wind kind of painting re-

The tomato dominates the full-page advertise-

looms large in the painting, making it larger than 
the wheel of the racing car in the same composi-

did not intend so I thought, 'Well, I will put in 
spaghetti, or I'll put in something very blatant.' So

135. Rosenquist has frequently remarked on the 
numbing impact ot the media-saturated environ- 
ment and its application CO his art In a 1987 inter- 
Mew Rosenquist -aid. "Being a child in America 
you are gcrting advertised at. It's like being hit on 
rhe head with a hall-pin hammer You become 
numb You're constantly hit upon So if you 
d( il with this or stop and imagine or wonder what 
is really happening to you and then you make a 
statement about it I wanted to use the tools 
and technology of advertising to do that" Rosen- 
quist. quoted in Staniszewski. "James Rosenquist."

"with all kinds of advertisements, in the numbness 
that occurred. I thought that something could be 
done in that numbness, that power" Rosenquist.

noted that women represented in the media bear a 
strong resemblance to machines — in fulfillment of 
the demand "that love goddesses be all alike' —

146. The photograph appears in Life 29. no 23 
Dec 4. 1950, p. 27. In a column called "Speaking of

leven close-ups. The text reads. "This is a 
game can you tell a shoe by its owner? Pho- 
tographer Burt Glinn thinks that shoes, in addition 
to their utilitarian function, are often an accurate 
reflection of the faces they help support" 
(pp. 26-27) On the page facing the grid of shoes is 
a grid of faces, and the reader is invited to match 

with the shoes The feet used by Rosen- 
quist are letter H and march the man with the 
cigar who is number 9 The collage for The Prome- 
nade of Merce Cunningham consists of carefully 
pieced together magazine clippings where the 
feet are framed against the face and hair of a 
woman Because she is shown upside down and 
her eyes are covered by the superimposed feel the 
woman remains anonymous. The distinction be- 
tween foreground and background is blurred 
as the spaghetti is used both behind the feet and 
the face. 

147 I thank Emily Braun for pointing out the com- 
monality of this motif in Rosenquist, de Chirico, 
and Ernst.

150 Although in this case Rosenquist s source is 
not an advertisement, McLuhan's question, "Why 
do the ad men hitch on to religious art with such 
unction?" remains relevant (The Mechanical Bride. 
P 76) The answer must be that these are the Ur- 
m Western cultute that are laced with the 
emotional messages that the advertiset wishes to 



elicit from the viewet and that Rosenquist in turn 
has appropriated.

James Rosenquist's work in printmaking has been more sporadic 
than that of many of his contemporaries, and he has been 
quoted as expressing his impatience with the waiting periods 
most print processes require and the size limitations printing 
presses generally mandate. Despite these reservations, he has 
made prints on and off for more than forty years, completing 
approximately 175 editions, 1 Included among them are some of 
the most compelling printed objects made by artists of his gen- 
eration. In fact, making prints has been a perfect metier for 
Rosenquist and has played a groundbreaking role in his art. 

Rosenquist's prints comfortably fit into and significantly 
advance the history of the print in Western art. In part, this is 
because his interests mesh with those on which artists working 
with print media have focused over the centuries: popular cul- 
ture, science and technology, and society and politics. His prints 
conceptually, if not specifically in relation to medium (such as 
woodcut, which he has not used), offer a logical extension to a 
progression that encompasses anonymous fifteenth-century de- 
votional woodcuts and Albrecht Durer's masterpieces, both reli- 
gious and secular, in that medium; the disasters-of-war imagery 
in etchings by Jacques Callot and Francisco de Goya y Lucientes 
(fig. 53); political satire in lithographs by Honore Daumier and 
social commentary in those by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec; and 
Pablo Picasso's extraordinarily experimental attitudes in virtu- 
ally all media. 

Rosenquist's visual responses to popular culture as it 
is manifested in the ephemera of printed advertisements and 
photographic reproductions placed his prints of the 1960s at the 



center of the Pop art movement. His overarching concern with 
social issues, such as the horrors of war and our growing 
destruction of the environment, are topics that have likewise 
provoked him throughout his career. One might cite printmak- 
ing not only as central to Rosenquist's art but also as a realm in 
which his expansive and experimental nature has been given its 
freest reign. 

For Rosenquist. as for many artists, making prints has been 
a collaborative activity. Printmaking can be a costly and compli- 
cated endeavor requiring a wide variety of equipment and mate- 
rials to say nothing of technical knowledge and rarefied skills, all 
of which have brought print publishers to the forefront of this 
aspect of artistic practice. Indeed. Rosenquist's career has coin- 
cided with the establishment and growth, throughout the 
United States and Europe, of printmaking workshops, either 
publishing workshops, where prints are both supported and cre- 
ated as part of a single operation, or what are commonly called 
job shops, where printers ply their craft in the employ of pub- 
lishers who finance artist projects. Whatever its orientation, 
each workshop has a distinctive character based on the priori- 
ties of its founder(s). 

Workshops that are part of a large publishing enterprise tend 
to be more extensive and able to produce work in a w Ide \ ariety of 
media, whereas job shops for the most part focus on a single 
process in which their owner/printer is most interested and skilled. 
Both kinds of printshops have been handmaidens to Rosenquist's 
work over the years. He has worked at most of the major publish- 
ing shops in the United States, including— in the order he

first worked at them — Universal Limited Art Editions, Inc. 
(ULAE), Graphicstudio/University of South Florida. Gemini 
GEL., and Tyler Graphics Ltd. 2 In the United States and Eu- 
rope, he has also worked with printers sponsored by numerous 
other publishers. 

Starting in the late 1950s. ULAE drew many New York 
artists to Islip, Long Island, as founder Tatyana Grosman's repu- 
tation for publishing some of the finest work in the field took 
hold within the art community. With that reputation came sto- 
ries of the elegant and sumptuous lunches Grosman hosted for 
visiting artists and staff, tales of her love for special papers, and 
the myth, at best, that an entire edition must be printed in a sin- 
gle day. It was at ULAE that the groundwork was laid for what 
came to be viewed as a renaissance of interest in the art of the 
print Graphicstudio brought Rosenquist to a very different 
setting. This university workshop in Tampa was more institu- 
tionalized in its atmosphere, and artists were invited to work for 
a specific period of time, set in advance of the visit. Rosenquist's 
circumstances caused Graphicstudio to alter this premise. 

Gemini GEL., founded in Los Angeles in 1966 by Sidney B. 
Felsen, Stanley Grinstein. and Kenneth Tyler, became renowned 
for its technological prowess, its use of cutting-edge materials 
and processes, its reach for the largest size printed image possi- 
ble in the most difficult to accomplish techniques, and its 
propensity to do series of works rather than single editions. 



After Tyler left the partnership and founded Tyler Graphics Ltd. 
in 1975, first located in Bedford and then in Mount Kisco, New 
York, his longtime interest in making paper by hand deepened, 
becoming a cornerstone of his new enterprise and one that 
Rosenquist utilized with enormous success in the 1990s. 

While all workshops have their individual character, it is 
also true that they have myriad elements in common. They are 
filled with fascinating supplies and equipment called for by the 
various processes: woodblocks for relief printing; metal plates 
for etching; specially prepared limestone or, in recent decades, 
special metal plates for lithography; and screens of silk tradition- 
ally, but synthetic fibers more recently, mounted tight as a drum 
in wood frames for screenprints. There are diverse drawing and 
related processing supplies: greasy liquids and crayons; blocking 
out and masking materials; delineative tools; greases, gums, and 
waxes; acid resists; and various highly dangerous acids that play 
different roles in the technique of etching and the process re- 
ferred to as "etching" within the lithographic enterprise. There 
are cans of ink, different types for different printing processes; 
driers and other additives that alter the ink consistency so it can 
be rubbed, rolled, or pressed in or on the printing matrices; and 
test color strips with what are called "drawdowns" that show 
how the ink will look on the paper as distinct from its appear- 
ance on the ink-mixing palette, which is usually made of glass or 
metal. Reams of different papers are stacked on shelves, varied

in texture, weight, tone, and size to meet the needs of images 
and techniques to say nothing of each artist's preferences. 

Absolutely essential is the heavy machinery, the printing 
presses with their beds and blankets, and scraper bars and lay- 
ers of Mylar. The presses vary in size and shape and are cranked 
by hand or electrified; some are used for direct printing, others 
for offset lithography, which was once considered a tool of com- 
mercial artists but has been embraced in recent decades by 
fine artists as well. And there are layered drying racks, where 
prints are placed so both ink and sometimes papers can 
be left to dry in preparation for the quality-control process of 
curatorial review, which takes place prior to the artist's signing 
the editions. 

The combination of supplies and equipment is specific to 
each shop and provides its aromas and distinctive sounds: the 
snap of a large mass of ink as it is mixed; the quiet whoosh of 
paper as it is moved from table to press to drying rack; the vari- 
ous noises of pressure applied and released as printing presses 
are put into motion. These elements create the special aura of a 
printshop— something like a chemistry laboratory, cabinetry 
shop, machine shop, and doctor's office combined— and trans- 
form greasy, "dirty" materials into immaculate art of enormous 
richness and range. This environment is quite different from the 
solitude of the artists' studios, where personally selected assis- 
tants generally are the only others present on a steady basis. 
The workshop community generates a high level of enetgy. 
which in turn can create a synergy of intellectual activity and 
lead to unpredictable creativity. 

Indeed, most essential to the practice within the shop— its 
spiritual base— is the chemistry among people. With the artist's 
project at the center, each participant in the collaboration must 
give his or her all to the creation of the work of art. In the best 
situations, the knowledge of the printers and publishers enter the 
dialogue at the outset, often bringing to the discussion sugges- 
tions of materials and processes new to the artist, in turn gener- 
ating ideas and possibilities. A devotion is required that leads to 
personal pride on the part of everyone involved in the accom- 
plishment of the artist's pro)ect, and Rosenquist elicits this kind 
of spirit, indeed passion, from those with whom he works. 

Rosenquist's earliest body of prints was accomplished at 




ULAE, and his most extensive recent printmaking project has 
been undertaken there as well, a group of lithographs inspired 
by Einstein's theory of the speed of light. The subject is of inter- 
est to both the artist and to Bill Goldston, Grosman's right-hand 
associate during her lifetime and the heir to the workshop at her 
death. The Speed of Light prints made at ULAE in 1999 and 2001 
have the dynamic enetgy and color brilliance one expects from a 
Rosenquist extravaganza, at once dazzling and celebratory but 
with an edge of drama, a suggestion of danger, an explosive 
quality hinting at a world gone mad or in danger of doing so at 
any moment. 

The complexity of Rosenquist's visual metaphors is difficult 
to track. As Goldston commented in discussing the distinctive 
qualities of the artist's work. "It's a stretch for me to know how 
he got from one place to another, to figure out how he connects 
these things he works with, puts an image with an idea 1 1 1 
deed, any single image in Rosenquist's vast complex of virtual 
collages does not readily lead in a direct line to an understand- 
ing of any of the others. Rather, the lengthy tracks of his thought 
patterns are often disjointed, crossed, and fragmented and de- 
pendent on the issues on his mind at any given moment.

Goldston described with great warmth his long-term rela- 
tionship with Rosenquist: "1 have so much fun with jim that it's 
difficult to separate what's done in the studio from what's going 
on in the rest of our lives We talk all the time, on the telephone 
when he's not here, about the government and our families and 
the art world. Because of that, the collaborations he and I have 
are more about fnendship; in amongst all those other mvolve- 
ments, the prints happen." He discussed the enormous strides 
Rosenquist made with the offset press, utilizing its potential in 
ways that had not been previously engaged, such as ways of 
combming the spare ink layer characteristic of offset with the 
heavier one set down by direct lithography. Goldston acknowl- 
edged as well their development of a way to produce so enor- 
mous a pnnted image as Off the Continental Divide (1973-74. cat. 
no. 251) by shifting the paper along the press bed. 

For artists, the fragmented and layered pract.ce of pr.nt- 
making provides a visual, tactile, and mtellectual encounter 
that is very different from those experienced in making either 
paintings or draw.ngs; new challenges are presented, and new 
kinds of images grow out of the technical demands of the 
methodology. Making art is always a step-by-step process, but 
by means of proofs that can be made at any point in the process. 



prmtmaking permits keeping track of the steps; the practice of 
making partial images en route to the finished piece provides a 
group of touchstones by which artists can track their progress. 
Some artists draw directly on these proofs as an essential part of 
their working method. But Rosenquist does not draw on his 
proofs; he studies them and then makes changes directly on the 
matrix itself. A proof may indicate, however, that the changes he 
h.is ,n mind are so major that an additional matrix is needed. 

Rosenquist's interest in printmaking is rooted in its poten- 
tial for experimentation, its offer that "whatever one can think 
of to do [there is the possibility) to do it like it's never been done 
before." 4 His process of making printing matrices and studying 
proofs has been one of "dissecting a body and getting to know it 
in all of its parts." He is equally clear about his concern for im- 
posing a limitation of means: "I really try to keep the number of 
printings to six or eight, to achieve with economy the maximum 
color range, to get the most out of the least. A lithograph is like a 
BLT sandwich; you put layers and layers together one on top ot 
the other, and that produces its own sparkle against the white 
paper." His BLT metaphor suggests the far-ranging connections 
Rosenquist makes not only in conversation but also in his art, 
causing viewers to stretch their imaginations in seeking the con- 
necting links that cause the works to sing. What he spoke about 
is the printed layering of six or eight colors, overlapping them in 
various combinations thereby producing dozens of variant hues. 
(He was not always so engaged by economy; The Bird of Paradise 
Approaches the Hot Water Planet [1989. cat. no. 269]. for example, 
called for thirty-three colors.) Rosenquist also recalled Crosmans 
love of special papers and his own interest in using sheets of high 
quality, although not necessarily the elegant handmade surfaces 
she proposed, to achieve works that will last over time. "What- 
ever one puts down, it might stick around," is how he put it. 

Rosenquist's first print. Certificate (1962, cat. no. 234), was in- 
cluded in The International Avant-Garde. America Discovered, 
Vol. 5, a portfolio organized by Billy Kluver and published by 
Galler.a Arturo Schwartz, Milan, in 1964. The artist printed the 
initial proof himself, in the art department of the University of 
Minnesota, Minneapolis, where he had studied before embark- 
mg for New York in 1955. 5 Combining a figurative found object— 
a photoengraved plate of a man, arm raised— that Rosenquist

obtained from a newspaper printer (an equivalent of the clip- 
pings used in the collages he made as "preparations" for his 
paintings), and etched abstract markings, this first published 
print tells us much about the path the artist was to follow 
in prints over subsequent decades: fragmentary imagery; the 
juxtaposition of figurative and abstract elements; a combination 
of linear and implied dimensional form; and technique using 
multiple media. 

Rosenquist's second print, New Oxy (1964), was included in 
lc Life, another landmark print publication of the early 1960s. 
Published by E. W. Kornfeld, Bern, its prints represent the transi- 
tion from an Abstract Expressionist style — against which 
Rosenquist and other artists were rebelling — toward the Pop art 
that was taking center stage. In H Life, Walasse Ting's poems, ed- 
ited by Sam Francis, are joined by original lithographs from 
twenty-eight American and European artists, including Jim 
Dine. Francis, and Asger Jorn, as well as diverse reproductions of 
commonplace objects such as a French postage stamp. The mix- 
ture of "fine" and "commercial" art, originals and reproductions, 
would have been of particular appeal to an artist of Rosenquist's 
inclinations. In any case, this project does seem to have encour- 
aged his further exploration of printmaking. 

Grosman had approached Rosenquist in 1962 about making 
lithographs at ULAE but at that time printmaking struck him as 
"more like craft than art," with the exception of Johns's litho- 
graph Target (I960). 6 A few years passed, and with Johns's 
encouragement, Rosenquist started a project with Grosman. 
After unsatisfactory attempts at drawing with crayon and tusche 
in the more traditional manner she championed, Rosenquist 
took to using his own preferred drawing tools — airbrush and 
stencils — and then worked closely with printers Frank Burn- 
ham, Ben Berns Zigmunds Priede, and Donn Steward to achieve 
the necessary intensity of hue. eventually adding fluorescent 
inks as well. His first ULAE lithographs, including Spaghetti and 
Grass (1964-65. cat. no. 235). Campaign (1965, cat. no. 236), Dusting 
Off Roses (1965. cat. no. 237). Circles of Confusion I (1965-66, cat. 
no. 241). and Roll Down (1965-66. cat. no. 239), are brilliant color 
compositions that set the tone of his future prints. In Circles of 
Confusion I, especially, one sees Rosenquist's layered color mix- 
tures, his "layers and layers together one on top of the other" 




Rosenquist completed more than a dozen prints at ULAE by 
the end of the 1960s, embracing such useful techniques as the 
"rainbow roll." which permits several colors of ink, placed adja- 
cent to each other on the inking slab and similarly applied across 
a printing roller to be layered on the stone or plate and then 
printed simultaneously. This further enhanced the soft, delicate 
edges he achieved with his airbrush and added another element 
of abstraction to the image overall. 

Rosenquist's imagery in these prints — and in those com- 
pleted with other workshops and publishers — was drawn from 
everyday life in the United States, often as basic as Kleenex 
boxes and General Electric lightbulbs. His visual motifs have al- 
ways referenced global and philosophical issues, however, some 
more directly stated than others. His prints have includi 
pressions of concern about militarism and war; environmental 
pollution and its aftermath, corporations and expanded indus- 
trialization; the impact of scientific explorations such as landing 
on the moon; nature/culture/industry/science interactions and

their effects on us all. These are the subjects of his paintings as 
well, but translated into print, they take on an aura of machine- 
age facture that adds another dimension to their meaning and 
enhances the social commentary that is so important an aspect 
of the history of prints 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Rosenquist worked with 
several other printers and publishers: Castelli Gtaphics, Richard 
Feigen Graphics, Hollanders Workshop, Multiples, Inc., Peters- 
burg Press, and Styria Studio, among them. It was a time of 
extraordinary excitement, experimentation, and productivn\ in 
the realm of printmaking. 8 The America Discovered and H life 
projects turned out to be prescient of several publications issued 
during the period, which each feature numerous artists 
and media. In these publications, Roy Lichtenstein is the one 
constant representative of "Pop," a categorical label also gener- 
ally applied to Rosenquist, who, like most artists, eschewed 
the designation either at this time or later. Rosenquist, in fact, is 
a star of the three II Pop Artists portfolios issued in 1965 and 
coordinated by Rosa Esman, an important proponent of the 
genre, for Original Editions; his Circles of Confusion (1965), in 




the first volume, Whipped Butter for Eugen Ruchin (1965, cat. 
no. 238), in the second, and For Love (1965), in the third, are all 
screenprints. 

The year Rosenquist first worked at Graphicstudio marks 
another milestone in his printmaking career. His introduction to 
that workshop in 1971 significantly transformed both the nature 
of his approach to printmaking and the nature of how Graphic- 
studio collaborated with artists. At the time, Rosenquist 
was based in New York, and after an initial visit to the work- 
shop and a provocative conversation with founding director 
Donald Saff, he agreed to return to Tampa with his family for 
the then standard two-week proofing session with an artist. 9 
His intention was to begin work on a series of prints and three- 
dimensional objects (the workshop's first foray into this terri- 
tory) on the subject of America going to the Moon: "the idea of 
it was to pay attention to what goes on the earth before you go 
over to the moon. Think about the earth again." 10 

Tragically, work in Tampa was shattered by an automobile 
accident involving Rosenquist and his family. Saff explained the 
workshop's response: "To help him through his recovery — his 
wife and small son were badly hurt — the workshop was turned 
over to him exclusively for an open-ended period of time This 
was the fist time such an arrangement was made. The result was 
the thematic exploration of a subject, an in-depth exploration, 
with the time to develop the technical means to achieve desired 
results." 11 This arrangement also caused the postponement of 
Robert Rauschenberg's first Graphicstudio working session, 
which Rosenquist had been instrumental in setting up. 

Members of Graphicstudio's staff (printers Charles Ringness 
and Theo Wujcik) and the university's art faculty (photographer 
Oscar Bailey and sculptor Alan B. Eaker) helped Rosenquist 
complete eleven lithographs between January and November 
1971. thereby ending this workshop's policy of working with 
artists for a limited and predetermined period of time. Two of 
the prints, Earth and Moon and Mastaba (cat. no. 245), incorpo- 
rate three-dimensional plastic faces with hourglass configura- 
tions that contain plastic beads; the works are meant to be 
turned upside down to permit the beads to move across the 
printed surface from top to bottom and then vice versa. Delivery

ability to work at this small scale despite his urge to be as expan- 
sive as possible. In contrast, for the ULAE prints Cold Spaghetti 
Postcard (1968) and Horse Blinders Flash Card (1969) the sheet sizes 
are much larger than the small images printed onto them 

In 1975, Rosenquist returned to Graphicstudio to work 
on prints that would be larger than any in the earlier group 
and would meet his continuing urge to incorporate three- 
dimensional elements. Aside from his sessions at the workshop, 
he was spending increasing amounts of time in Florida, and in 
1976 he would buy property in Aripeka, where he has lived and 
worked part of the time, in addition to New York, ever since. Be- 
tween the 1971 and 1975 sessions in Tampa, he had undertaken 
Off the Continental Divide, the largest print made at ULAE to 
that date. Using an offset lithography press, it was eventually 
printed from twenty-nine of the forty-six plates Rosenquist had 
worked on for its complex image — this involves economy at an- 
other level, no longer a BLT but a BLT club. Off the Continental 
Divide is one of Rosenquist's few prints whose imagery pre- 
ceded, rather than followed, that of a related painting, in this 
instance. Slipping Off the Continental Divide (1973, cat no, 74). ,2 



In 1977, when Rosenquist worked for the first time at Gem- 
ini GEL., his project included three prints, two of which. Star 
Pointer and Star, Towel, Weathervane, incorporate collage ele- 
ments and die-cut shapes with the multicolor lithography that 
has remained Rosenquist's primary print medium. When he re- 
turned to Gemini in 1981 to do the eleven prints in The Glass 
Wishes series, he went back to the intaglio processes he had used 
for his very first print, Certificate. This later group is far more 
complex that that earlier endeavor, however, including aquatint 
as well as etching and printed in ravishing color. As usual. 
Rosenquist altered traditional methodologies, for example, by 
using an airbrush technique for making aquatint. The Glass 
Wishes are an unusual group of images for him, essentially em- 
ploying the traditional still-life format of objects resting on an 
implied if not explicit surface, rather than a collagelike confla- 
tion of motifs. 

During 1986 and 1987. Rosenquist was back at Graphicstu- 
dio. Eager to try something new, he gave his tendency toward 
collage greater flexibility in the series Secrets in Carnations, five 
prints that incorporate monoprint and lithography. His aim. in 
part, was to do prints on a larger scale: "given the limitations of

the presses. I though if we could . . . print pieces of things and 
adhere them to this big [monopnnted] paper, then we'd have a 
big print ... So we did [monoprint] images, and they're all differ- 
ent backgrounds. Yet the printed lithography was the same, and 
we collaged the surface so that was a big print [created] on 
small presses." 13 For the entire group, Rosenquist combined 
imagery of flowers and women's faces. In general, neither the 
dramatic forms of his images nor the large size at which he has 
preferred to work call for specialty or handmade papers, but one 
of the Secrets in Carnations prints. The Kabuki Blushes (1986. cat. 
no. 267). is an exception. Here, he used Chiri Kozo paper, and the 
random scattering of specks embedded in the paper heightens 
the image's ethereal character. By this time, the jagged leaves of 
the palmetto palm that surrounds his Aripeka home had 
worked their way into his work and are a dominant formal fac- 
tor in this series of monotype/lithograph collages. 

Two aquatint etchings were done at Graphicstudio during 
this period as well, demonstrating the artist's extraordinary 



delineative skill. The Prickly Dark (1987) and Welcome to the Water 
Planet (1987. cat. no. 268) show that this great colonst is equally 
able to make use of the grisaille that had been of interest to him 
as far back as his earliest paintings. These prints are tours de 
force of aquatint— astonishing drawings on copper— with the 
airbrush technique used previously for The Glass Wishes playing 
an important role. All of the richness this method can obtain 
may be seen especially in Welcome to the Water Planet, with the 
tonal range moving from the palest of grays to the richest of vel- 
vety blacks— aquatint etching at its most sumptuous, using very 
different means to achieve the dramatic richness of Goya's 
Disasters of War etchings. Earlier, the potential for such elegance 
of grays and blacks had been equally fulfilled lithographically in 
Bunraku (1970, fig. 62). 

Welcome to the Water Planet again reveals Rosenquist's 
impatience with the limitations of press size: he worked 
two copper plates simultaneously, to be printed one at a time, 
each on half a sheet of paper. The subjeci likewise cont.nued

Rosenquist's expression of concern for preservation and conser- 
vation of natural resources, expressed in printmaking as early as 
his first ULAE and Graphicstudio publications. The "water 
planet." Earth, was a theme Rosenquist continued to explore in 
his first project at Tyler Graphics Ltd. in Mount Kisco. a series, 
also entitled Welcome to the Water Planet, published in 1989. With 
Tyler, he found another soul mate in the quest for large-scale 
printmaking and new methods of working. An important com- 
ponent of Tyler's then newest workshop was an extensive 
facility for papermaking, a practice that long before had taken 
its place at the center of many Tyler Graphics publications. 14 
When Rosenquist and Tyler began their collaboration it was 
with the intention of combining lithography and handmade 
paper pulp. To do so at the size Rosenquist desired, Tyler had to 
reconstruct his papermaking studio, adding an overhead electric 
hoist and putting in a new vacuum system for removing water 
from large sheets of pulp in order to turn them into paper. 
He also designed and had built a five-by-twenty-foot press 
on which both lithography and etching could be printed, but its 
delayed delivery caused him to collect from Florida a press 
Rosenquist kept in the Aripeka studio. In the end, ten works, 
nine of which constitute the Welcome to the Water Planet series — 
including The Bird of Paradise Approaches the Hot Water Planet

which returns to the imagery of the painting House of Fire (1981. 
cat. no. 97), is the largest, measuring almost five feet in height 
and ten feet in width. These works pushed size and process to 
the limits of contemporary practice in printmaking. All are 
marked by a combination of shimmering form and brilliant color 
particular to the paper-pulp medium. The technique, however, 
was a conceptual outgrowth of the lithograph/monoprint col- 
lages, the Secrets in Carnations, done at Graphicstudio. 



Rosenquist's concern for the "water planet." and for all of us 
who inhabit it. is a profound one that has engaged him through- 
out his career. In his prints, as in all his art. he has addressed the 
world's problems and triumphs as his own. all the while telling 
us that they are not only his but ours as well. How else does an 
artist make a difference in the world other than sharing his vi- 
sion' When that vision encompasses our most profound issues, 
we had best pay attention. And when that vision is stated with 
the unmitigated energy and high-key color of Rosenquist's 
prints, it is difficult not to.

in his career, lames Rosenquist created a small number of works 
that he defines as nonobjectivc "existential paintings ."' In each, the 
he ids of men are depicted within quartered or gridded planes, and 
Rosenquist rendered them anonymous by obscuring their faces and 
identities in myriad ways. In Upfront the Ranks (1961 fig 70). he physi- 
cally erased the faces of telephone executives featured in a Life magazine 
article, an act that was. for him, tautological, "so that anonymity be- 
comes anonymit) Th.s work on paper inspired the paintings -) Young 
Revolutionaries (1962. fig. 71) and 4-1949 Guys (1962. cat. no. 22) In 
-) Young Revolutionaries, the identities of the men are hidden behind ob- 
rhat may define their character, cropped by the window frame 
through which they are viewed, and obscured by lacunae and cracks 
in the glass of the windowpanes (the lacunae and cracked glass repre- 
senting gunshot holes). The painting comments on the short memory ol 
history, and the anonymity and obscurity that is often the endgame 
of those sacrificed for leading revolts. According to Rosenquist. "when 
there is a revolution in a country, usually the first revolutionaries are 
killed by the new government, because they don't want those guys 
around any longer." The visages appear to be "moving out of the scene" 
| fade into the past and from memory. 
While representing ideas about anonymity and the elimination of 
identity, these works also reflected Rosenquist's continued interest in ab- 
straction: "I had these ideas about nonobjective painting Well, what is 
more nonobjective than something you can't remember' It is usually 
more difficult to remember something from four. five, six years ago than 
something nostalgic from twenty, thirty, forty years ago." With this sense 
of detachment in mind, he drew from magazine clippings of the recent 
past to construct the imagery of most of his works at this time. By 
obscuring the figures' identities. Rosenquist also subverted the represen- 
tational quality of the imagery. Throughout his career, he has thought 



of himself as an abstract artist, and these works reflect this larger 
tttempi to achieve nonobjective painting through the paradoxical use of 
representational imagery. 

Even as he rendered identities anonymous, Rosenquist indexed the 
idea of celebrity and self-promotion III novel ways. "As an adman [bill 
board painter], I was surprised how people advertised themselves" 
l was painting billboards in Brooklyn, replicating things over and 
over again for this great American economy, but I was getting bored and 
ling came over me that I needed to react to these ads." He repro 
duced in paintings the pictures of celebrities and performers, such as 
Joan Crawford and bluesman Big Bo (Bo McGhee), just like you saw 
them m advertisements thereby exposing the constructed identity in 
herent in self-promotion, the marketing and promotional images he con- 
sidered to be "self-portraits " By unmooring images from original SOU! 
and contexts, he eviscerated these "self-portraits of their original pur- 
pose and content. Poignantly, he did so by co-opting the same vocabu- 
lary in which they were created the slick visual language of comma 
advertising, undressed and hung out to dry in a fine-art setting. 

Untitled (loan Crawford Says ) (1964. fig 75) is as much a witty cri- 
tique of the actress's private behavior as an expose of her constructed 
movie-star persona This image was originally used to endorse cigarettt 
In a Camels ad in 1951. but Rosenquist employed the idealized portrall 
and truncated text to frame a lapse by the actress that the artist pet 
ally experienced: "|oan Crawford wanted to sponsor a Pop art show with 
Pepsi Cola in the early sixties. She called up a bunch of artists 
promised a show, and then just disappeared It never happened 
also demystified or exposed the cult of celebrity surrounding fohn F 
Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. In President Elect 1 1960 61 1964, tig 72), 
the image of Kennedy was borrowed from a 1960 presidential campaign 
poster. Rosenquist juxtaposed this portrait with images of middli 
wealth and consumetism in order to ask, "Here is this new guy who 
wants to be President of the United States during the 1 isenhowei I I 
what is he offering us?" In Marilyn Monroe r (1962, fig 73), the face I 
mented. cropped, and partially turned upside down, and lettering 
out only a portion of the actress's name. Rosenquist painted the worl 
after seeing Monroe purchase a New York Times from a newsstand In 
Irvington. New York, tipping over a stack of papers in the process 
Despite distortions and alterations that should obscure her identity thi 
luring "brand" value of the actress's name and image informs the por- 
trait. Rosenquist's deadpan transcription of these media-derived images 
provides an avenue of awareness to the powerful sway that advt l 
and self-promotion exercise over everyday lift

fig 76 Masquerade of the Military Industrial Complex Looking Down on the Insect World 199? (cat no 126) 



modern issues 
and current events 



Over the past four decades, lames Rosenquist has created work that in- 
stinctively reflects the temper of the times. Addressing modern issues 
and current events on the world stage, his unique brand of imagery has 
registered antiwar statements and voiced concern over the social, politi- 
cal, economic, and environmental fate of the planet 

F-IU (1964-65. cat no 54) is the most well known and celebrated of 
Rosenquist s works ind is often identified as an antiwar painting In 
1%4 the artist began creating the eighty-six-foot-long painting in which 
consumer products are superimposed over the rendering of the fuselage 
of a fighter-bomber The work addressed the detachment of a consumer 
society that was fueled by the military industrial complex during the 
Cold War and alluded to the escalating conflict in Vietnam. Rosenquist 
was initially inspired to paint F-IU (the name of an aircraft then under 
development for the military) aftei seeme an old abandoned B-36 plane 
at a Six Flags amusement park in Texas Just as the amusement park 
was a false natural environment built in the heat of Texas," he felt the 
consumer wealth at that time produced a false sense of security based on 
the war industry: "The building of war planes provided income for 
countless American families, but I couldn't understand why the govern- 
ment wasn't building hospitals and schools instead of warplanes that 
would immediately become obsolete." 1 

Rosenquist has also reflected on wars and political turmoil in other re- 
gions. The Holy Roman Empire through I heckpoinl ( harlie (1994, cat. no. 01) 
alludes to Berlin and the aftermath of World War II, and The Flame 
Dances to the Mirror While the Charcoal Draws (1993. fig. 77) confronts the 
ethnic cleansing in the Balkans in the 1990s. In The flame Dances to the 
Mirror While the Charcoal Draws, the fire represents the self-immolation 
of the fighters who "watch themselves burn up in the conflict," and the 
charcoal is the artistic community working right in the middle of the ter- 
rible devastation in Yugoslavia. "While war is going on, the artistic com- 
munity tries to survive." The painting not only expresses horror at the 
turn of events but also wonderment at how creative endeavors are pur- 
sued within such an environment. 

Ir i not uncommon for the title of Rosenquist works to include puns 
that underline a social or political message For instance. Four New Clear 



n (1982. cat no. 99) may also be read as "Four Nuclear Women." 
Painted at a time when women such as Margaret Thatcher— then Prime 
Minister of the United Kingdom— had achieved leadership in govern- 
ment and by extension over the economy and military, it questions 
whether their new positions wete transparent and dependable or wen 
warmongering and a nuclear threat to security like those of man) ol 
their male counterparts Military Intelligence (1994, fig 78) serves up a 
double entendre. The eyeglasses represent intellect, and for Rosenquist 
the intellectual prowess of the military (metaphorically engulfed in 
flame. i iv simultaneously destroying itself, like a dragonfly biting off its 
own tail." By playing up the implied oxymoron in the title, the work 
ridicules the wisdom of military dictatorships and likewise acknowl- 
edges that the learned class of intellectuals (also represented by the 
eyeglasses) is often banished or eliminated in societies governed by 
undemocratic regimes. "The intellectuals are always killed when a gov- 
ernment is overthrown ." 

After the failed coup against Mikhail Gotbachev as the leader of the 
Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Soviet cosmonauts were nearl) aban- 
doned in space as the political turmoil played out For Rosenquist. the 
frightening idea of "Russian astronauts stuck in space during glasnost, 
who feared political problems would prevent them from returning to 
Earth," inspired Masquerade of the Military Industrial Complex Looking 
Down on the Insect World (1992, fig. 76). Expressing a connection to the 
astronauts looking down to Earth, Rosenquist described watching ants 
at his studio in Aripeka, Florida. From his vantage point, they seemed to 
make "the same mistakes over and over again, and bring to mind many 
questions about history repeating itself in the human race." 

A political and environmentally conscious perspective is also revealed in 
the Water Planet paintings, such as Welcome to the Watm Plana (1987, fig. 79), 
The Bird of Paradise Approaches the Hot Water Plana (Grisaille) (1989, cat. 
no. 117), and Where the Water Goes (1989, cat. no. 116) The artist identifies 
tlu se lusciously painted floral and aquatic works as "ecological and politi- 
cal paintings," which address life on earth and the choices that humankind 
makes here. In describing Welcome to the Water Planet, Rosenquist explains. 
"The water planet is Earth. A visitor from another universe comes by. and 



126 | 127 



iv, Hey, Welcome to this mess! It's hell, it's burning up, but come on 
in!' The painting is ultimately about making it [the water planet, and our 
existence on Earth) nicer.'' The Cold light Suite print series from 1971 like- 
wise challenges the sophistication of a human race that can send a man to 
the Moon, but has problems dealing with the social ills at home. In Moon 
,:,.nn Mistaken for the News (1971, fig. 80), Richard Nixon and Henry 
Kissinger's secret war in Cambodia is featured in the headlines of a news- 
paper illuminated by the Moon. Characteristically, a private inspiration 
informs the title and the work Rosenquist recounts that his cousin 
Archie, as a young soldier in World War II, helped liberate the German 
concentration camp Buchenwald while in retreat from the Germans (a re- 
treat that, according to Rosenquist, was kept secret from the United States 
population) Using a German barracks as a latrine, his cousin reached for a 
roll of toilet paper only to find that it was a moonbeam shining into the 
barracks In describing the suite of prints, Rosenquist commented, "Why 
aren't we spending money on the ground instead of spending money going 
to the moon?. . . We can't eat the moon " : 

In 1992 — when his daughter Lily was a few years old — Rosenquist 
began work on a series of paintings entitled The Serenade for the Doll aftei 
Claude Debussy, Gift Wrapped Dolls. Neither a meditation on childhood nor 
children's playthings, the paintings address love in the time of the AIDS epi- 
demic, while the title bears witness to Debussy's Serenade of the Doll 
(1906-8). which the French composer had written for his own young daugh- 
ter. Rosenquist's dolls— distorted by the shiny refractions and jewel tones 
ol i he cellophane in which they are wrapped— "are the result of (the 
artist's] feelings about the child who has to look forward to the difficulty of 
relationships because of AIDS The coolness, the thoughtfulness that will 
be in a young romance make it seem the complete antithesis of passion Z' 1 
Rosenquist confronts the issue with both trenchant wit and a sense ol tragic 
loss, an approach he would use again in a series of gun paintings in 1996. 
These twenty-six paintings feature revolvers and pistols leveled at the 
viewet by male or female hands, and juxtaposed against bright, monochro- 
matic backgrounds. "I want to illustrate the stark look and confrontation of 
a handgun . . These paintings are intended to be nondecorative and 
oblique I hope they question the idea of who really is the target." 4 

The artist's grand and global narratives comment on the failures and 
foibles of humankind. Yet the very fierceness of these critical commen- 
taries convey a sense of hopeful optimism about the survival of humans, 
their ecologies and social environments

walk-in paintings 



One of the most frequently cited aspects of James Rosenquist's work is 
his penchant for working on a vast scale — a fact often attributed to his 
employment 3s a billboard painter in the Midwest and New York during 
the 1950s. But Rosenquists use of scale has been an important device to 
create a visual environment that envelops his viewers. The Swimmei in 
no-misi (1997-98, figs 83-85). commissioned for the Deutsche 
Guggenheim Berlin, is the largest of his experiments in constructing an 
installation painting I he work places the viewer within a panoramic 
space churned by the roaring spin cycle of distorted popular and 
in historical imagery, including visual quotes from two renowned 
sources, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) and Rosenquists own F-Ul 
(1964-65, fig 86).' 

The genealogy of the monumental scale employed to create an en- 
vironment in The Swimmer in the Econo-mist can be traced to F-m This 
painting was the first of what journalists and critics would refer to as 
"wrap-around paintings F-llI is composed of fifty-one panels (some of 
which are reflective aluminum i which originally covered all available 
wall space in the front room of Leo Castclli's New York gallery Thi em i 
ronment created by F-JJJ forces the view* l to reckon with the limits ol 
his own vision as the bn adth of the work plays on the periphery of the 
vu wi i - vision as he craversi - the space. Thus, this work becami in 
early experiment in Rosenquist's continuing interest in the nature of 
peripheral vision 

Horse Blinders (1968 69, fig. 87), perhaps most explicitly thematizes 
this examination of vision jusi outside the scope of direct sight. Alu- 
minum panel&gt; cerminati ill ol the four walls of this environment, reflect- 
ing and distorting rhe light effects and painted imagery on the adjoining 
walls. One reviewer noted that this reflective effect provided I 
sense of "spatial continuity " : Horizon Home Sweet Home (1970 fig 88) 



also explores the possibilities of reflective surfaces and dematenalized 
spaces. Painted monochromes interspersed with shimmering Mylar pan- 
els create the effect of fragmentary color shards and complementary col- 
ors among the light reflections. Rosenquist's installation controls nearly 
every aspect of the environment, even dissolving visual contact with the 
gallery floor. Fog produced from a dry-ice machine blankets the gallery 
floor, and the viewer is instituted as an integral component whose own 
reflection becomes part of the work; thus, the viewer is utterly immersed 
in the painting. Rosenquist 's impulse to place the audience inside his 
paintings was also articulated in earlier works such as Forest Ranger 
(1967, cat no. 68) With imagery painted on hanging curtains of clear 
Mylar strips, viewers were encouraged to walk through the paintings — 
to literally penetrate the picture plane. 

Rosenquist's installations provide insight for the viewer: they repro- 
duce the artist's own perceptions of the visual assault of everyday life, as 
provoked by both the physical properties of natural phenomena and the 
man-made elements of contemporary media-driven culture.

flora and florida: 
"crosshatched" paintings 



in ih, early 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s. James Rosenquist 
created a Crosshatch technique of intersecting images. Varying his previ- 
.'ii K , si iblishl d u-i ol nixtaposing forms, these striations collide to 
teveal forms that burst through the surface of the canvas. The cross- 
hatching , xposes interiors that .in noi offered in tesolution of a total 
but instead reveal the turbulence o( paradoxical ideas and 
• it. Lronments. 

Marcel Duchamp was one of the first to breach the sacred space of 
the canvas by painting a ten onto its surface In his seminal Tu m' (1918). 
In the late 1950s, Lucio Fontana continued in the tradition by actually 
making incisions into his canvases with a catpet knife, revealing the 
Spaa behind the paintings surface Rosenquist. in a similat rebellious 
desire to move beyond the two-dimensional picture plane and into other 
I i . developed his Crosshatch technique. He often pierces images 
depicting natural or astronomical environments with human forms to 
elucidate and emphasize the threats posed by out increasingly techno- 
logical environment Formally, the palm fronds surrounding Rosenquist's 
Atipeka, Florida, studio may have inspired the exploration and develop- 
ment of his crosshatching di i ic« 

Rosenquist has also indicated that the imagery of these works was 
inspired b) his living and working in Florida's natural wetlands, as op- 
posed to his New York studios I he works address the tension between 
conflicting modes ,'&lt;' vie \s well as the decisions one makes in selecting 
[cm ition in. i hi. tyli But beyond thest earthly concerns, as Rosenquist 
i lu p ii gs address questions ol reincarnation, where the hier- 
archical dominance of mankind over nature is reexamined and over- 
turned What it we awoke one day to find ourselves inhabiting a plant 
form? How would reintegration with a rtatui ii habitat change our per- 

. eption of and regard for that environment? The artist's impetus for The 
nee o) i (ecrrical Nymphs in Space (1985, fig 93) — which explodes 
in a mural-size profusion of blossoming flora — was a commemoration to 
ilu life and memory of Mahatma Gandhi (Rosenquist identifies il as a 
"funeral pyre" for the leader), and as an exploration of the spiritual 
i, .ui, i s beliefs about th&lt; afo rlifi 



Commissioned to adorn the dining room of the Four Seasons 
restaurant in New York, Flowers, Fish and Females for the Four Sens.m 
(1984, fig. 89) uses the Crosshatch technique of intetsecting representa- 
i ions The underlying imagery exposes a bounty of richness offered by 
nature in trout and flower blossoms, traversed by human consumers, 
depicted in the painting by stylish female patrons. 

In Samba School (1986. fig. 92). trompe-l'oeil incisions into the 
canvas unearth an even more chaotic and unresolved interior than the 
activated absttaction that overlays it. This revelation of new pictorial 
space does not attempt a resolution, yet as layet slashes through layer, 
the buildup of abstraction combined with human and natural forms 
adds to its potent cacophonous motion, achieving a palpable dynamism 
of the carnivalesque This work exemplifies the ability of the ctosshatch- 
ing technique to incotpotate both the advance and retreat of figure and 
ground, creating disorienting visual interplays. 

Influenced by the vibrant flora around his studio, Rosenquist 
painted the flowers of this tropical climate in all their vibrant bravura 
and delicacy. In Nasturtium Salad (1984. fig. 90) and Passion Flowers 
(1990, Gg 91), the plant life suggests open possibilities invoking a respect 
for nature, its overwhelming power, and its inherent beauty. Splicing the 
C invas are faces of women. Their wide-open eyes and hints of flesh and 
lips peek through in shardlike configurations and looping cut-oul 
intersect the dominant floral imagery The precise markings ol thi 
human interference allude to a mechanical age and technological 
progress that, like the images, are sometimes at odds with nature. Yet 
both categories of imagery coexist on the same picture plane, and while 
then distinctions do not allow a simple coalescence of one into the other 
the) yield a new interpretive whole Rosenquist presents us with the 
paradox of these two worlds that inform our present human experience 
These flower paintings interconnect with the concerns of the Watei 
Planet series of the late 1980s (e.g.. cat. nos. 109 and 110), which is both a 
celebration of natural plant forms and a prescriptive elegy to the dese- 
cration of Earth's natural habitats.

space and scientific phenomena 



For much of his career, James Rosenquist s work has registered a fascina- 
tion with space and scientific phenomena, as well as the hardware of 
industrj and technology. Some of these works document the United 
pace program, others utilize childhood memories o( a meteor 
felling CO earth, and one series addresses the theory of relativity and the 
p, | | of light. Drawing from historical events, memory and scil no 

i flea thi curiosity about the cosmos, technology, and sci- 
l nunc theory that infects th( artisl Thoughts and his wotk. 

In 1970, Rosenquist painted Flammgo Capsule (fig. 94). which 
concerns the Vmerlcan space program and commemorates the three as- 
tronauts who dad in .1 l«&gt;i»7 Hash lire duting a training session foi Chi

American flag, a twisted and distorted food bag. and the arc of a balloon

cessits foi com linerized oxygen foi survival in space As with much of 
Rosenquist's oeuvre, while the painting references a specific historical 
event the imagery can seem enigmatic.

Rosenquist articulates the relativity of visual and mental perspec-

a career that has informed and produced the painting. Like an archaeo 
logical site, the painting is underpinned by the sum ol his experience, 
which remains unseen on the surface of the canvas: "Underneath it all i 
all my experience " Conceptually, the works acknowledge the great di- 
vide between the artist's process and execution (mental and ph) 
and the viewer's perception and interpretation of that experience as a 
fixed state on a canvas. "The paintings ate about my imagination as to a 
new s lew, or a new look at the speed of light. And they also have to do 
with the whole history of my experience put into a painting." In the past, 
Rosenquist attempted to use representation to achieve abstract 
tives. but hete he depicts concrete experience through abstraction Cos- 
mic In theme, the works tighttope between absttact yet literal splashes 
ol paint and vortexes of illusionistic modeling, all depicted in a reverber- 
ating palerte of yellows, blues, magentas, and greens

( hai i s musical instruments. American dollars, to name but a few— that

work is representative of "a parking lot in space for Junk." Star Th. 
deals in pari « ith "the way Earths ptoblems were being taken out into 
space: war and conflict." Rosenquist has explained that Stai I ftiej Is dso 
about the work ethic; you focus on a goal and go after it. but once you 
hav. done the work you have gained a new perspective and uavel In a 
new direction In this painting, "the star is the original attracr.on. Once 
you reach the star, you make a diversion because you can see even fur- 
ther So. the star is the 'thief that brings you to all the places you 
didn't originally plan to go. It is like thinking: the more [thinking] 
you do. the deepet you go. and the more mysteries you see and wanl 

to discover."

an astronomer observes and 
feels james rosenquist's art 



"WOW!" That's the awestruck starting point of this astronomer's ex- 
cited, visceral reaction to many of my friend |im Rosenquist's works The 
sheei size, Che huge physical scale, the boldness of the colors and pat- 
terns — almost cosmological in scope! 

The "wow" factor is something like the exclamations, the "oohs" 
and "aahs." often heard from people who are looking through a tele- 
icopi fol the Orel time at the Moon or at Saturn and its rings or at a star 
cluster a gut-level reaction to a visual experiem i 

Jim has used astronomical themes and images for years. In The Bird 
.•I Paradise \pproachestheHot Water Planet (Grisaille) (1989, cat. no. 117) 
and in the related graphic (cat. no. 269). the large mottled image in the 
top hall is dearly, at least to an astronomer, a representation of what is 
called a "very early-type spiral galaxy"— a galaxy where the spiral arms 
in |ust beginning to form chej an barelj visible stars form, primarily, 
in tin m spiral arms. In many galaxies, these star-formation regions con- 
tain spectacular clumps of relatively young (tens to hundreds of millions 
0l yi ais old Instl ad of billions of years old like our star, the Sun), very 
bright, whiO hoi and blue-hot stars. Whether by knowledge and inrcnt 
or by chance, |im has placed across the galaxy image many very bright 
little blu. and-white "collages" And these collages are not just scat- 
tered around; their placement looks like they are tracing out spiral arms. 
Astronomy involves looking — originally just with the human eye, 
nowadays with exceedingly complex devices. But the information ob- 
tained by these sophisticated devices are manipulated and transformed 
until ihey can be displayed in a form comprehensible to our eyes This is 
ire still our most -often used sense organs to assist our 
minds in grasping and comprehending what is around us Maybe that is 
why Jim has eyes in so many of his works. 

U hile the Earth Revolves at Nighl (1982. cat. no. 98) and Leaky Ride 
for Dr. Leakey (1983. cat. no. 100) prominently feature what ate called 
"circumpolar star trails ." These are hours-long time exposures made 



with a wide-angle camera aimed in the same direction that Earth's rota- 
tion axis points — that is, the direction of the North Celestial Pole, the 
star called Polaris happens to appear very close in the sky to this pole. 
The stars trace out portions of circles on the film as the camera's aim is 
rotated by Earth. By noting how high in the sky Polaris appears to be, 
we can locate where we are on Earth. These images, beautiful in their 
color and perfect concentricity, convey a feeling of alignment, centered- 
ness, and "I know where 1 am and where I'm going"— which certainly 
seems to describe Jim. 

The Stowaway Peers Out at the Speed of Light (2000, fig. 97) and the 
other works in the Speed of Light series (1999-2001, cat, nos. 142. 143, and 
146), in their distortions/contortions of things I think 1 can barely recog- 
nize, represent to me the very real distortions of the passage of time and 
of appearance — relative to us standing still here on Earth— that do exist 
when things are moving near the speed of light. It is as If Jim's mind is 
moving close to the speed of light— so he "sees" things differently than 
we ordinary mortals. 

Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope are familiar to all. Many 
show exquisitely delicate, diaphanous forms— as if they were snapshots 
of one of the continuously changing "sculptuted light" compositions of 
Thomas Wilfred's Lumia— so delicate and tranquil. But the great dis- 
tances from which we arc taking these pictures and the fact that they 
are just snapshots in time mask the reality that the universe is a violent 
place. Huge amounts of energy are being unleashed. Tremendous 
amounts of matter are moving at enormous speeds. The sheer physical 
i| [im's paintings— their sweeping, gigantic, boldly formed and col- 
ored patterns— almost viscerally convey the size, the pell-mell pace, the 
rush, the violence of the universe 

But this is all talk I just look at Jim's works and feel "WOW 1 "

1933-50 

lames Albert Rosenquist is born on November 29, 1933, in Grand Forks, 

North Dakota. He is the only child of Ruth Hendrickson Rosenquist 

and Louis Rosenquist. who are of Norwegian and Swedish descent 

respectively. 

During Rosenquist's childhood, his family moves from one Mid- 
western city or farming community to another, including Atwater, 
Perham. and Minneapolis in Minnesota, and Tipp City and Vandalia 
in Ohio. Rosenquist's father works at a series of jobs, including a 
motor-court and gas-station operator, airplane mechanic, and other 
positions in the aviation industry. Rosenquist's mother and his 
paternal uncle. Albert, have experience as pilots. By age eight Rosen- 
quist has become an avid maker of model airplanes. In 1941 he visits 
the Minneapolis Institute of Arts with his mother, an amateur 
painter. When he shows an aptitude for sketching at an early age. 
she encourages him. 

By 1944 his family has settled down in Minneapolis, purchasing a 
house on Nokomis Avenue. In his teenage years Rosenquist paints 
portraits and landscapes. He submits a painting of a sunset and wins 
a scholarship in junior high school for four Saturdays of art classes at 
the Minneapolis School of Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. 
At the institute Rosenquist is first exposed to quality art supplies — 
such as Arches and Strathmore papers, which he will use throughout 
his career — and takes classes with older students and teachers who 
have studied in Paris and across Europe on the GI Bill. 

1951-54 

In 1951 Rosenquist and his father travel by car to visit California and 
the Pacific Northwest. While in Southern California, they cross over 
into Mexico. In spring 1952 Rosenquist graduates from Roosevelt High 
School in Minneapolis. With the encouragement of his mother, he 
enrolls in art classes at the University of Minnesota. Minneapolis. He 
attends the university from fall 1952 until spring 1954, learning oil 
painting, egg tempera, and Renaissance underpainting from painter 
Cameron Booth ' Booth — who had studied with the painter Hans 
Hoffmann and taught at the Art Students League. New York, in the 
mid-1940s — becomes Rosenquist's mentor. Booth takes Rosenquist 
and another student to view Impressionist and old master paintings 
at the Art Institute of Chicago. 

During the summer of 1953, Rosenquist works for the commercial 
painting contractor W. G. Fischer. He travels across the Midwest as 
part of a Fischer crew, painting Phillips 66 signs, gasoline and storage 
tanks, refinery equipment, and grain elevators. After leaving the 
University of Minnesota with an associate's degree in studio art, 
Rosenquist paints billboards in Minneapolis and Saint Paul for Gen- 
eral Outdoor Advertising, including promotional signs for the movie 
Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, advertisements in Saint Louis 
for Corby's Whiskey, and advertisements in Minneapolis for North- 
west Airlines and Coca-Cola. He travels to Florida and Cuba. 



1955 

Encouraged by Cameron Booth, Rosenquist applies to the Art Stu- 
dents League, New York He receives a scholarship, which includes a 
year's tuition but nothing for room and board. Rosenquist arrives in 
New York with a few hundred dollars as well as Booth's letter of in- 
troduction and his list of affordable restaurants. At the Art Students 
League. Rosenquist studies under Will Barnet. Edwin Dickinson, 
Sydney E. Dickinson. George Grosz. Robert Beverly Hale, Morris 
Kantor, and Vaclav Vytlacil. Rosenquist frequents the Cedar Tavern, 
where he meets painters Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Milton 
Resnick. Diagnosed with pneumonia before the end of the academic 
year, Rosenquist is treated in the welfare ward at Roosevelt Hospital 
in Manhattan 

1956 

Rosenquist leaves the Art Students League, New York, after the 
1955-56 academic year. He works as a chauffeur and bartender for 
Roland and Joyce Stearns and also minds their children at the fam- 
ily's Irvington, New York, estate. There he works on small abstract 
oils and drawings in an octagonal studio space on the top floor of 
the Stearns home. In September he meets artists Jasper Johns, Ray 
Johnson, and Robert Rauschenberg in New York. He also meets 
Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, and Jack Youngerman this year. 

1957 

Rosenquist quits his job with the Stearns family and moves back to 
Manhattan. He lives for a time in a loft at Sixty-third Street and 
Amsterdam Avenue, which he shares with Takeshi Asada. Alice 
Forman. Chuck Hinman, Peggy Smith, and Joan Warner. Rosenquist 
joins Local 230 of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Al- 
lied Trades union and begins painting billboards in New York. His 
first assignment is to paint a Hebrew National Salami sign on Flat- 
bush Avenue in Brooklyn for A H Villepigue Company. The firm 
lets him go shortly after this task. He then paints signs in Brooklyn 
for General Outdoor Advertising but is subsequently laid off. Rosen- 
quist travels home to Minnesota, retaining his studio in New York. 
In Minneapolis he paints promotional signs on a freelance basis, in- 
cluding a number of automobile advertisements on building exteriors. 
He subsequently returns to New York, where he begins painting bill- 
boards for Artkraft-Strauss Sign Corporation. He lives briefly in a 
studio at Broadway and Twenty-seventh Street In his spare time 
Rosenquist attends drawing classes with Claes Oldenburg and Henry 
Pearson. The sessions are organized by Robert Indiana and Jack 
Youngerman. whose wife, Delphine Seyrig, serves as a model. Simul- 
taneously, Rosenquist creates abstract pieces, including a nine-by-

1958 

As .1 commercial artist, Rosenquist paints billboards in Manhattan 
and Brooklyn, including signs in Times Square for the Astor Victoria 
Theater and the Morosco Theatre, both located at Broadway and 
Forty-fifth Street. He moves to an apartment and studio at Second 
Avenue and Ninety-fourth Street, where he continues to create abstract 
paintings and works on paper. He also begins looking for a separate 
studio space In the spring Rosenquist's abstract painting Passing 
before ihe Horizon (1957) is included in the 1958 Biennial: Paintings, 
Prims, Sculpture at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. 

1959 

At age twenty-five Rosenquist becomes head painter at Artkratt- 
Strauss Sign Corporation. He meets Gene Moore, head window 
designer at Tiffany &amp; Co., Bonvvit Teller, and other stores, who hires 
him periodically over the next two years to design displays and paint 
backdrops for store windows on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. 

1960 

In June, Rosenquist marries textile designer Mary Lou Adams, whom 
he had met while painting Times Square billboards. He is featured in 
the United Press International article "Billboard Painter, Local 230. Is 
Broadway's Biggest Painter." Ray Johnson introduces him to painters 
Agnes Martin and Lenore Tawney, who live and work in Lower Man- 
hattan. Rosenquist quits working for Artkraft-Strauss Sign Corpora- 
tion after two fellow painters fall from scaffolding and die. He rents 
the studio that had been Martin's at 3-5 Coenties Slip, near the work- 
spaces of Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, and Jack Youngerman.and 
commits himself to a career in fine art. He shares his studio space 
with Charles Hinman for part of the year. At Coenties Slip, Rosen- 
quist begins creating paintings, such as Zone (1960-61), that incorpo- 
rate commercial sign-painting techniques as well as images of people 
and products derived from advertisements and photographs. With 
the financial backing of Robert and Ethel Scull, Richard Bellamy — 
who will become Rosenquist's first dealer — opens the Green Gallery 
in New York in October with the exhibition Mark di Suvero. 

1961 

Several art dealers pay visits to Rosenquist's Coenties Slip studio, 
including Richard Bellamy, Leo Castelh with his gallery manager Ivan 
Karp, Ileana Sonnabend, and Allan Stone. Henry Geldzahler, a cura- 
tor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York, and several pri- 
vate collectors also come. Stone offers Rosenquist an exhibition with 
Robert Indiana, which both artists turn down. Rosenquist makes his 
nrst sale with Robert Scull's purchase of The Light That Won't Fail 11 
(1961). Scull is president and owner of a large fleet of New York taxi- 
cabs: Super Operating Corporation. He will become one of the largest 
private collectors of 1960s Pop art and a Rosenquist enthusiast In 
October a photograph of Rosenquist painting The Light That Won't 



Fail I (I%1) appears on the cover of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Sunda) 
Pictures magazine Rosenquist meets critic Gene Swenson, whose 
sympathetic interviews with him and others associated with Pop ait 
will help legitimize their work within the art world. 

1962 

In many works painted this year, such as Untitled (Two Chairs), 
Capillary Action, and Untitled (Blue Sky). Rosenquist attaches small 
rectangular or circular canvases to the surface of the larger paintings 
He ptoduces his first print, Certificate, a small photoengraving and 
etching for inclusion in the fifth volume of Italian gallerist Arturo 
Schwarz's portfolio International Anthology of Contemporary Engraving 
The International Avant-garde: America Discovered. Billy Kluver selects 
the works for the portfolio. 

The Green Gallery. New York, presents Rosenquist's first solo 
show, opening in January, for which the artist designs a poster featur- 
ing his painting Pushbutton (1961). The exhibition, orgam 
Richard Bellamy, sells out. Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo. an 
early collector of Pop art, purchases three paintings: Pushbuttoi 
Hammer (1962). and Waves (1962). In March, Art International pub- 
lishes Max Kozloffs "'Pop' Culture. Metaphysical Disgust, and the 
New Vulgarians." one of the first articles linking Jim Dine. Roy 
Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenbutg, and Rosenquist together as a group. 
In April, Rosenquist's Shadows (1961) is included alongside works by 
Dine, Jasper Johns, Lichtenstein. Oldenburg, and Robert Rauschen- 
berg in the exhibition 196/ organized by Douglas MacAgy at the Dal- 
las Museum for Contemporary Arts. In September. Gene Swenson's 
atticle "The New American Sign Painters" is published in Art News, 
which associates Rosenquist with Dine, Robert Indiana, Lichtenstein. 
and Andy Warhol. In the fall Rosenquist is included in Art 1963: A 
New Vocabulary, organized by Billy KlUver for the Fine Arts Commit- 
tee of the Philadelphia YM/YWHA Arts Council: other artists I 
sented include Dine. Johns, Lichtenstein. Oldenburg, Rauschenberg. 
George Segal, and Jean Tinguely. Instrumental in recognizing 1 1 
nificance of the young artists who will be identified as "Pop artists," 
Kluver, a scientist at Bell Labs, will organize several early exhibitions 
featuring their work. Rosenquist is represented in seminal exhibitions 
at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York and the Dwan Gallery in Los 
Angeles The title of the exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery. Intel 
national Exhibition of the New Realists, galvanizes the name "New Real- 
ists" for the American and British artists, who are represented along- 
side the work of the continental Europeans known as the Nouveau* 
Reahstes. "New Realism" would shottly be replaced by "Pop art," a 
term critic Lawrence Alloway had used to identify the work of several 
British artists who incotporated the imagery of advertising and 
popular culture into theit work in the late 1950s. The Dwan Galler) 
i Khibltion, My Country I is o) Thee, includes Rosenquist's Heyl I 
for a Ride (1961) and also features other young artists such as Indiana, 
Lichtenstein, Oldenburg. Warhol, and Tom Wesselmann

In Scpcember. Rosenquist's son John is born in New York. 
Rosenquist serves as a visiting art lecturer at Yale University, New 
Haven, during the first semester of the 1964-65 school year at the in- 
vitation of Jack Tworkov. In the fall he travels to Los Angeles for the 
opening of his solo show at the Dwan Gallery, and is also featured in 
a solo show in Turin, Italy, at the Galleria Gian Enzo Sperone. Com- 
missioned by architect Philip Johnson, Rosenquist's World's Fair Mural 
(1963-64), a twenty-by-twenty-foot oil painting on Masonite, is fea- 
tured on the Theaterama building at the New York State Pavilion of 
the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. Rosenquist becomes affiliated 
with the Leo Castelli Gallery. 

Rosenquist gathers photographs and information about the F-lll 
fighter bomber being developed for the United States military, and 
begins painting F-lll (1964-65), which will measure ten by eighty-six 
feet when complete. With word spreading about the monumental 
painting, a succession of artists and members of the art world visit 
the Broome Street studio, where Rosenquist documents them in a 
o( Polaroid photographs At the suggestion of Jasper Johns, 
Rosenquist begins working with Tatyana Grosman at Universal Lim- 
ited Art Editions — a printmaking workshop located at Grosman's 
home in West Islip, Long Island. Between 1964 and 1966. he produces 
even lithographs at ULAE, including Spaghetti and Grass (1964-65), 
c ampaign (1965), and Circles of Confusion I (1965). Rosenquist contin- 
ues to work with ULAE over the course of the next forty years. 

1965 

Rosenquist is one of five artists (the others are Roy Lichtenstein, Claes 
Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Tom Wesselmann) featured in lavish 
studio pictorials in one of the first major books on the movement, Pop 
Art, with text by John Rublowsky and photographs by Ken Heyman. 
He is also included (along with the four artists in Rublowsky's Pop Art 
and Jasper Johns) in Dorothy Herzka's Pop Art One, a small-format 
portfolio of reproductions issued by the Publishing Institute of Amer- 
ican Art. This portfolio includes Rosenquist's Silver Skies (1962), 
Dishes (1964), Lanai (1964), and Untitled (loan Crawford Says ..) (1964). 
In the spring the painting F-Jll (1964-65), is featured in the exhibition 
Rosenquist at the Leo Castelli Gallery. New York. The work is in- 
stalled along the four walls of the gallery's front room. Rosenquist 
intends to sell the fifty-one panels of F-lll separately. The day after 
the exhibition closes, however, Robert Scull buys the entire work 
The purchase is featured in an article in The New York Times, in which 
Scull is quoted: "We would consider loaning it to institutions because 
it is the most important statement made in art in the last fifty years." 6 
In the summer Rosenquist studies Eastern philosophy and histot \ 
at the Institute of Humanist Studies in Aspen, Colorado, where he is 
an artist-m-residence along with Allan D'Arcangelo, Friedel Dzubas, 
and Larry Poons. He meets artist Mated Duchamp at the New York

In September he travels to Stockholm for the exhibition James 
Rosenquist: F-lll at the Moderna Museet, and from there flies to 
I l ningrad. where he meets Evgeny Rukhin, a Russian artist with 
whom he has been corresponding James Rosenquist: Fill will tour 
to major venues across Europe over the course of the next year. In 
the fall the Green Gallery closes. 

Three of Rosenquist's multicolor screenprints are Included in Rosa 
Esman's portfolio 11 Pop Artists, published by Original Editions. One 
of the screenprints, Whipped Sutter for Eugen Ruclun (1965), Is dedicated 
to Rukhin. The planes of distinct, flat blue, yellow, and red within 
this work are reminiscent of Soviet propaganda posters of the 1930s. 

1966 

Rosenquist commissions the fashion designer Horst to tailor a brown- 
paper suit with paper donated by the Kleenex Company He wears 
the suit to gallery and museum openings throughout the year. whi&lt; h

Protest Tower. The tower, a fifty-eight-foot-high tetrahedron con- 
structed on an empty lot in Los Angeles, is covered with canvas panels 
painted by artists and others to demonstrate their opposition to the

1971 

In February, Rosenquist, his wife, and their son are seriously injured 
in an automobile accident in Florida. While his wife and son conva- 
lesce in a Tampa hospital, Rosenquist travels back and forth between 
Tampa and New York, renting a two-story studio on Wall Street in 
Lower Manhattan. He begins collaborating with Donald SafTat 
Gnphicstudio/University of South Florida, Tampa, where he produces 
the print series Cold Light Suite (1971). 

1972 

The Wallraf-Richartz-Museums, Cologne, and the Whitney Museum 
of American Art, New York, each host a Rosenquist retrospective this 
year. Evelyn Weiss organizes the retrospective James Rosenquist: 
Gemalde-Rdume-Graphik for the German museum, which is installed 
at the Kunsthalle Koln. The Whitney presents the painting retro- 
spective James Rosenquist, organized by Associate Curator Marcia 
Tucker, which travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago 
The Whitney show is negatively reviewed by John Canaday in The 
New York Times, who likens Rosenquist's work to a corpse and the 
exhibition to a wake. In a letter to The New York Times, Rosenquist 
protests the critic's choice of words in light of the 1971 accident that 
permanently injured his wife and son. "1 know more about death 
than Mr. Canaday. I prefer life. Long live artists, long live art collec- 
tors, long live art dealers, long live art critics, but damn a person like 
Mr. Canaday." is he writes. 

Rosenquist demonstrates in Washington, D.C., against the 
Vietnam War, and is arrested and jailed for one night. He travels to 
London to work at Petersburg Press, where he produces several prints 
based on early paintings, such as Hey! Let's Go for a Ride (1961) and 
Pushbutton (1961) In New York he produces the four panels of the 
lithograph and screenpnnt Horse Blinders at Styria Studio with Marion 
Goodman, relating to the 1968 painting of the same name. Rosenquist 
will come to consider Horse Blinders to be his most important monu- 
mental print of the 1970s. K ' 

1973 

Rosenquist rents two storefronts, at 1724 and 1726 Seventh Avenue in 
Ybor City, Florida, to use as a studio. Founded at the end of the 1800s 
by Cuban immigrants, Ybor City is part of east Tampa. By 1973 he is 
also renting a studio on the Bowery in downtown Manhattan, as he 
continues to work in both Florida and New York. In the Bowery stu- 
dio he returns to large-scale painting with such works as Paper Clip 
and produces experimental hanging wotks, one of which incorporates 
the Coca-Cola logo and is made from Tergal polyester fabric. The 
latter work hangs dipped into a trough of colored ink, which is gradu- 
ally absorbed into the fabric through capillary action. 17 Rosenquist is 
represented in the exhibition Contcmporanea in the fall at the Villa 
Borghese, Rome. 



1974 

Rosenquist is included in the exhibition \merican Pop 1". ciliated by 
Lawrence Alloway. at the Whitney Museum o| \mi r i « in \rt. New 
York. He completes the lithograph Off the Continental Divide (1973-74), 
the largest print ULAE has produced up to this point. This print 
addresses the flow of water from the Midwest to the East, reflecting 
Rosenquist's own trajectory from Minnesota to New York ls H( ai 
tends a Senate subcommittee hearing with fellow artist Robei | 
Rauschenberg to lobby for legislation regarding artists' estate Into l i 
tance taxes and resale royalties. 

1975 

In lanuary, Rosenquist and the artists' rights advocate Rubin Gore- 
witz address several hundred artists in Chicago about artists' royalty 
legislation. 1 '' Rosenquist designs a set for Deuce Coupe //, a dance 
choreographed by Twyla Tharpe and performed by the fofftey Ballet 
at City Center. New York, in the spring. Rosenquist and his wife Mary 
Lou divorce. 

1976 

Rosenquist continues to travel back and forth between Tampa and 
New York, eventually purchasing land in Aripeka. Florida, forty-five 
miles north of Tampa on the Gulf of Mexico, on which he begins
