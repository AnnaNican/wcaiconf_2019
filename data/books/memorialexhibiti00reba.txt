PREFACE 

by HILLA REBAY 



(This article on Kandinsky by Hilla Rebay, Director of the Museum of Non-Objective 
Painting, New York City, was originally published in Pittsburgh in the May 1946 issue 
of the "Carnegie Magazine" under the title of "Pioneer in Non-Objective Painting.") 



Wassily Kandinsky was born in Moscow, December 5, 1 866. As a child, he loved to paint. 
The effects of colours on him were deeply felt. The beauty of the sunset over the cupolas 
of Moscow and the intensity of colour in peasant art, contrasting with the grey vastness of 
his native country, enlightened his vision. After terminating his law studies at the age of 
thirty, he was offered a professorship. In refusing it, at this turning point of his life, 
he made the decision to abandon a safe career and to leave for Munich to study painting. 
He later recalled this decision as "putting a final period to long studies of preceding years." 

After two years of painting in Munich, he was admitted to the Royal Academy where he 
studied under Franz von Stuck. This instruction, however, did not satisfy him and in 1902 
he opened his own art school, which closed two years later when he undertook a four-year 
series of travels to France, Italy, Tunisia, Belgium, and Holland. Upon his return to Munich, 
there occurred one evening at dusk the magical incident of his seeing merely the form 
and tone values in one of his paintings. While not recognizing its subject, he was not only 
struck by its increased beauty but also by the superfluity of the object in painting, in order 
to feel its spell. It took him fully two years to crystallize this miraculous discovery. Never- 
theless, he still used objective inspiration in the paintings of this period, but only as a 
structural element, while the organization of form and colour values, used for the sake 
of composition, already dominated these abstractions. 

In 1910, Kandinsky wrote his famous book "On the Spiritual in Art" a theoretical treatise, 
in which he established the philosophical basis of non-objective painting. The following 
year he finished and exhibited his first entirely non-objective canvases, which attracted 
world-wide attention and excited controversies of tremendous import. Between 1914 and 
1921 Kandinsky lived in Russia where he acted in several official artistic capacities. In 
1919 he became the director of the Museum of Pictorial Culture in Moscow and, as such, 
founded the Institute of Artistic Culture for which he wrote the recently published Culture 
Plan. In 1920, he was named professor of art at the University of Moscow. In 1920, 
also in Moscow, he created the Academy of Artistic Science, of which he became 
vice-president. 



Later that year, Kandinsky returned to Berlin where, at the Wallerstein Gallery, he 
exhibited his first open-spaced canvases, in which one sees his turning from lyrical organ- 
izations of effervescent colour expressions to a more dramatic clarification of definite form 
and space precision. With infinite care he studied the dimension of open-space in contrast 
to colour value and form extension, as well as line direction and the intensity of the point. 
After 1923, he perfected, with scientific precision, his marvelous presentation of colour 
technique. He also taught at the well-known Bauhaus, first established in Weimar, later 
in Dessau, until 1933, when prejudiced authorities ordered its closing. Kandinsky then left 
for Berlin, but finally, the next year, settled in Paris, where he continued his work until 
his death, December 13, 1944. 

As his last paintings prove, with intense concentrations, Kandinsky increasingly refined the 
precision of balance in the given space of the painting, as the innermost powerful essence 
of its rhythmic tension. Like every creative painter of our day, he ceased to be satisfied 
with representation, however artistic, but felt more and more the desire to express his 
inner life in a cosmic organization. He was, however, the first to proclaim this principle; 
and when he realized that the musician's incorporeal freedom from earthly inspiration 
for his art was also privilege of the painter, he became one of the most violently attacked 
pioneers. He courageously maintained this conviction, in spite of the all-powerful objective 
tradition and mass belief. With his God-given freedom in the artistic, esthetic creation of 
rhythm, he invented the first painting for painting's sake, and not for the sake of informa- 
tive make-believe, as had been the ideal of the past. He found that a non-objective 
painting's rhythmic life, expressing creative invention, can be profound if done by a 
visionary master. It can also have a strong ordering influence on the observer. This, he 
found, was denied to representative painting, through its imitative, lifeless limitation. Yet 
this is equally denied to those schematic, mediocre, condensed patterns by most so-called 
abstract painters, whose decorations are as far removed from being art as the organ- 
grinder is from musicianship, or as the scale is from the sonata. 

The rhythmic law of constructive counterpoint, contained in a creative masterpiece, sets into 
motion life itself, through a rhythm displayed between harmonies and the contrasts of 
colour and form, with which the given space is beautified. In order to clarify, for the 
serious student of painting, the existing counterpoint in the law of correlation, Kandinsky, 
through intense concentration on these esthetic problems, undertook profound studies, 
outlined by him in his treatises, as well as in his culture programs. He wrote extensively 
about the theoretical and technical elements of his art. These writings offer valuable tools 
to those who are endowed and eager to express their creative urge. At the same time, 
such knowledge of counterpoint and technical elements is not at all needed by the 
layman in order to enjoy this art. Without professional knowledge, all he is expected 
to do is either to like or dislike the painting, as he would a melody or a flower, which, 



like all other God-given creations, are equally beyond understanding and which, like art, 
are simply there to be enjoyed. 

Because the non-objective painter reacts intuitively to a superior influence and realization 
of the universal law, he is enabled to give his message. The sensitive and prophetic 
artist of our day has refined his senses to receivership of those invisible, spiritual forces 
which he intuitively expresses. He derives with subtle sensibility his visionary inspiration 
from the spiritual domain which is indestructible and his very own to whatever degree he 
has developed his faculty to receive. Thereafter, his creations develop with a wealth of 
variated beauty, controlled by laws of counterpoint, which make his artistic message as 
endlessly alive and original as nature itself. 

The artistic expression of our day no longer responds to materialistic objectives; it has 
advanced to become spiritually creative. No longer must the painter display a lemon to 
paint the beauty of an intense yellow; or search the sky to contrast it with a lovely 
blue; nor must he anywhere at all hunt for earthly motives before he is permitted to 
paint. At will, he can now organize forms and colours into the virgin-white of his canvas 
and the esthetic purity of a given space, which is his canvas; so as to enrich its beauty 
without disturbing its loveliness, he is now free to follow a higher evolution beyond the 
pretense of make-believe. Unknown to some painters who have missed their epoch and are 
still shackled by the caveman's out-dated urge for reproduction, the freedom of art has 
become infinite, through the painter's vision of new possibilities and esthetic expressions 
which are spiritually conceived and of superior value. The eyes of the painter have been 
liberated to vision, freed from the bonds of imitation and the pretense of a perspective make 
believe. A faked third dimension is exchanged for a visionary reality. The non-objective 
artist is a practical educator, the bearer of joy and a creator who deals with eternity. 
His painting gradually elevates the onlooker, through pleasurable realization of esthetic 
refinement, to harmony containing order, which proves satisfying to the soul's need for 
perfect peace. 

The prophetic, immaterialistic ideal of the modern painter proclaims the coming era of 
spirituality. His reaching into the absolute emphasized the subconscious desire of all men 
to such advance. The increase in material ease of life, which man has accomplished by 
harnessing invisible forces of electrical waves, rays, or atoms has freed him now and has 
given him time with which to direct his aims, to increase his cultural and esthetic expres- 
sion, and to contact the eternal realities of permanence, so close to all and yet so 
utterly ignored by most. 

Non-objective painting helps to free the human soul from materialistic contemplation and 
brings joy through the perfection of esthetic enlightenment. Therefore, Kandinsky was not 
only a painter and scientist, but also a prophet of almost religious significance. The ideal 



of his art was conceived even before the utter illusion of the density of matter had been 
proved by science, and before the reality of frequencies and invisible forces had opened 
the imagination of man to unlimited expectations. The profound truth of Kandinsky's 
theories at once impressed those who were equally capable of feeling esthetic enjoyment 
through his paintings and of realizing the importance of Kandinsky's mission at its advent. 

Since photography and motion pictures today record all events, situations, or persons for 
practical or sentimental need, the skill of modern man has been freed from reproduction 
by hand, thus enabling him to cultivate a higher stage in art expression by following his 
creative esthetic urge. His eyes have become sensitized to realize the rhythmic life in the 
span of the in-between — the life that is the essence of a non-objective masterpiece. Such a 
masterpiece, due to those spiritual qualities, becomes everlastingly appealing in its endless 
combinations of colours, forms and contrasts, in their relationship to each other or to space. 
It can be easily observed that each colour and design motive is organized in itself, while 
constantly reacting and playing with its form or colour opponent. Thus it brings restful en- 
joyment, which is as peacefully uplifting as the observance of the infinity of the starlit sky. 
Out of such pleasures emerges the realization of the rhythm which lies in the in-between, 
realized by following the motives and discovering the meeting points of lines and forms, 
in contrast to a calm harmonious unit. 

Contrary to the static form-ideal of painting which prevailed in the past millennium, where 
the subjective object was immediately perceived as a whole and graphically recorded by 
the intellect, always directed objectively earthward, the moving form-ideal of today sets 
into motion the eye in any desired direction of the rhythmic non-objective creation. This 
cannot be mentally recorded or memorized like objective impressions because it points 
heavenward, as an expression of infinity. If to some the harmony of order and beauty of 
these non-objective creative paintings is not immediately obvious or appealing, it gradually 
becomes evident to anyone permanently exposed to their increasingly realized influence. 
Through this, the onlooker subconsciously enfolds his personal advance towards exactitude 
and sense for esthetic beauty, finding it immensely enjoyable and useful. Because the ob- 
jective painting contacts earthly matter only, it cannot cause such spiritual evolution. 

To unfold the human soul and lead it into receptivity of cosmic power and joy is the tre- 
mendous benefit derived from the non-objective masterpiece, so intensely useful and con- 
ceived from the primary essence of creation. In loving Kandinsky's paintings, we assimilate 
ourselves with expressions of beauty with which he links us to a higher world. Kandinsky's 
message of non-objectivity is the message of Eternity. 



NOTES ON THE LIFE, DEVELOPMENT 
AND LAST YEARS OF KANDINSKY 



Wassily Kandinsky, painter, designer, etcher and writer, the first artist, who eliminated 
objects from the contents of his paintings, was born in Moscow, December 5th, 1866. He 
studied National Economy and Statistics at the University of Moscow, to which for six years 
he was attached to specialize in National Economy. In 1 897 Kandinsky refused an assistant 
professorship at the University of Dorpat. His belief in the healing power of Social Science 
and in the absolute correctness of positive methods had waned. He realized, that he had 
wasted his time; only later was he grateful for the experience. Since the wages of work- 
men had been his special field of research, he thought it most essential to get direct 
practical information. So he accepted a position in one of the foremost printing estab- 
lishments of Moscow, as its director. 

This new field of activity concerned printing through the phototypic process, which con- 
sequently brought him in contact with art, as well as to close association with workmen. 
One year later, when he was 30 years of age, he left Moscow to follow his life-long 
urge to become a painter and in 1 897 went to Munich to study. For two years (1 901 -03) 
he studied at the Azbe School. From 1903 to 1908 he travelled in Italy, France, Tunisia, 
Belgium and Holland. Finally in 1908 he worked for one year at the Munich Academy 
under Franz Stuck. 

Before long, he took part in exhibitions, but was condemned by critics for his "slovenly, 
crying colors" and "exaggerated design." While the Munich Secession declined his 
paintings several times, nevertheless he became a member of the "Berliner Secession," of 
the "Deutscher Kuenstlerbund" and of the "Salon d'Automne" in Paris. He worked hard 
to study the intricacies in the technique of oil with tempera and varnishing colours. He also 
created a number of black, white and coloured woodcuts. Consciously, Kandinsky pro- 
ceeded along the path to creative painting, gradually eliminating the objects from his pic- 
tures. Some non-objective paintings reproduced in his first Autobiography (written 1 91 in 
German, published 1912) he called "Gegenstandslos" or literally translated "object 
without" while in the second Autobiography written in Russian he called them "Non- 
objective" in precise translation. 

In the year 1908-1911 he was nearly deserted: surrounded with mockery, hatred and 
distrust, branded as clumsy, a cheat and even a lunatic, or "Hottentot in evening cloth." 

The first who gave him a hand was Franz Marc, the famous cubist and animal painter, who 
also provided for Kandinsky's book an editor and a business manager. Thereafter Alfred 



Kubin and Arnold Schoenberg spoke up for him. In Berlin, Herwarth Walden offered 
to take care of his exhibitions and sales, and opened court proceedings against slandering 
of Kandinsky by the press. 

In 1911 he painted his first abstract painting and in 1 91 2 a set of Non-objective etchings. 
His book, "On the Spiritual in Art" (Piper edition) was written in 1910 and saw three 
editions during the year of 1912-1913. The sensational Sonderbund Exhibition of 1912 
in Cologne, where under tents hundreds of Van Goghs and of Gauguins were assembled 
for the very first showing, as well as that of 62 outstanding Cezannes, Munch and Hodler 
collections and Lehmbruck's "Kneeling Woman" which "disgraced" the entrance, some 
abstract Improvisations by Kandinsky startled the unprepared and outraged public. A 
nucleus of this extraordinary show was brought to New York by Marie Sterner presented 
in the sensational Armory Show, repeated in Chicago and in London's Albert Hall, also 
introducing Kandinsky. Alfred Stieglitz was the first in the U.S.A. to acquire one of 
Kandinsky's great paintings. During the first German Autumn Salon, which was arranged 
by Herwath Walden in 1913 and framed by the art-collector Bernhard Koehler in Berlin who 
gave Walden 100,000 gold-mark for this enterprise, Kandinsky's work attracted much 
attention. After this, the collectors of Germany, Austria, Holland, England and America 
began to show a keen interest in Kandinsky and his paintings. In the same year appeared 
"Der blaue Reiter" ("The Blue Rider") edited by Kandinsky and Franz Marc in the Piper 
publication. Also a "Kandinsky Album" appeared in a "Der Sturm" ("The Tempest") 
publication with his first autobiography written in 1912 and edited by Herwath Walden 
in 1913. In 1914, the editor, R. Piper, published his "Klaenge" ("Sounds"), a one-time 
deluxe edition of small poems in prose and 56 woodcuts by the artist. 

His book "On the Spiritual In Art" was translated into English and appeared in London 
and in the United States in 1914. It was expected to appear in Dutch, French and Russian but 
the first World War interfered with these plans as well as with the staging of his play "The 
Yellow Sound" ("Der Gelbe Klang") which had been first published in "The Blue Rider." 
In 1914 Kandinsky returned to Russia and in the subsequent years worked theoretically 
and in practice on abstract and non-objective painting and the proclamation of cultural 
progress. In 1916 he published in Stockholm a second set of etchings. 

In 1918 the Commissariat for Public Education in Moscow published his revised auto- 
biography of 1917 with reproductions of his works from 1902-1918 and a text by the 
artist. In 1920 Kandinsky was made Professor of Science Aesthetique at the University of 
Moscow and teacher at the Academy of Fine Art in Moscow. Also in 1 920 Kandinsky pro- 
posed the Schematic Plan of Studies and Work of the Institute of Art Culture. This plan, 
which proclaims the artistic ideal of Kandinsky, is published by the S. R. Guggenheim 
Foundation; it has been translated from the Russian in honor of the Kandinsky Memorial 
Show. In 1921 Kandinsky was nominated to the All-Russian Academy of Art. 



At the end of 1921 Kandinsky returned to Berlin. The paintings which he brought from 
Russia were shown and the new light background was much admired. In July, 1922, he 
concluded the work on a mural for the Reception Hall of a projected museum, in tempera 
on black canvas, at the request of the independent artist group called "Juryfreie" in 
Berlin. Since July, 1922, he was active as one of the teachers of the Weimar Bauhaus. In 
1923 there appeared in the Propylaen publication his "Small Worlds" ("Kleine Welten") 
— 1 2 original woodcuts, etchings and lithographs. Also he prepared at that time illustrations 
in pen to Romisow's "Dreams," to appear in print, as a Orchis Publication in Munich. 

Also in 1923, the Society Anonyme in New York, founded by Katherine Dreier, made 
Kandinsky Honorary Vice President. 

In 1926 he transferred with the "Bauhaus" from Weimar to Dessau. Around 1928, his 
book "Point, Line and Plane" ("Punkt, Linie Zur Flaeche") appeared as a Bauhaus publi- 
cation. Also in preparation was a play "Violett," written as far back as 1914. Other 
deeds, as Kandinsky puts it in one of his letters, included stage decorations, used in 1928 
for the Friedrich Theater in Dessau's performance of "Pictures on Exhibit" by Mussorsky, 
whereby it was officially announced that the scenery and stage management had been 
handled by Kandinsky. Later on, these decorations were intended to be used by Stokowski 
in a Philadelphia performance of Mussorsky's work, yet this plan was discarded. A 
ceramic wall painting for a music room, shown in the Architectural Exhibition of 1931 in 
Berlin, was Kandinsky's next deed. In 1934 when the Bauhaus was closed, he first 
moved to Berlin, then to Paris. About this time Kandinsky spoke in letters to Hilla Rebay, 
some excerpts of which follow: 

1934 Neuilly sur Seine — Boulevard de la Seine 135. 

"Above you will see the address of our new apartment. After lengthy consideration I 
decided to move to Paris for some time. We will not remain here less than a year. What 
will happen after that, we cannot say, in view of the present unstable conditions. 

"My situation in Germany became very unfavorable because I have three full 'minuses' — 
(1) I am not a born German (even a 'former Russian'), (2) a former Bauhaus teacher 
(something that today, it is queer to say, is almost equal to being a Marxist), (3) an 
abstract painter. I have, so to speak, three vulnerable spots. In accordance therewith I was 
attacked, or to make it plainer, I was 'given the cold shoulder'. The artist groups to which 
I have belonged for years, passed me over in their exhibits. The museums have placed 
my paintings in storage. My contract with Dessau, according to which I am still entitled to 
half of my salary until April 1st, 1933, was forcefully dissolved. Exhibitions, even in 
private galleries, became impossible for me. Therefore, also, the art dealers were no 
longer able to represent me energetically. In one word my hands were tied. I left v/ith 
a heavy heart, as I had lived in Germany since 1897 and had gained a great footing 
there . . ." 



And again in 1935 he wrote to her: "The main thing here in Paris is, that I can work so 
very well. I spent time painting large canvasses. These I like, as I had to relinquish them 
for years, because I had only three full days to paint during my time at the Bauhaus, 
the other days were filled with teaching, meetings and preparation to teach . . . 

"You know what it means when one is well in form to create, and yet, as of command, 
has to put down the brush. Besides the spiritual side, how often is it technically impossible 
to break up suddenly such work. And besides loss of time, how much loss of strength, of 
nerves, the Bauhaus has cost me. This waste of energy lasted twelve years. Very much 
though I enjoyed working with youth, and I was happy to give them something, though 
I was no more 30 or 40 years old — Sad — Sad." . . . 

And again to Hilla Rebay on April 21st, 1936. 

"My exhibitions, our course, are no excursions. Of my own accord I make no detours to the 
side or the front. That is, the detours are made for me. The detours are arranged for me 
in the shape of exhibitions. That is, my 'one man exhibitions' have been arranged for me 
constantly since my return from Moscow in 1921, in various countries — in Europe and 
America. I would not mention anything about this, if you had not mentioned such exhibi- 
tions in connection with others. 

"Praise: That you have made me twenty years younger, is very flattering. Sorry, sorry and 
again sorry, I was not born in 1886 but in 1866 into this bad world. But do not, by all 
means, believe that I feel that old. No, at times I even believe that my age is only a 
mathematical error. And then I take a piece of paper and write: 1936 less 1866 — 70! 
The only consolation is that I still have seven months to go to 70. However, I have another. 

"I feel this way: At the beginning of the war, I was 48. However, from the beginning of 
the war on, the tempo of life constantly increased and today continues to increase; so I 
count every year as an average of 15 years. Thus 22 years have not passed since the 
beginning of the war, but 330— therefore I am today 48 plus 330 or 378 years old 
or young which sounds better. But where is the consolation? Here it is. A young man who 
was only 20 at the beginning of the war is today 20 plus 330, or 350 years old. The 
difference of age between him and me is therefore very small. 

"However, as my calculation is only my personal method, people are beginning to speak 
of my anniversary. I sometimes hear that a large anniversary exhibition should be held 
for me in Paris. Of course, I would not have anything against this. However, I ask v/ho 
does it and where does the necessary money come from. For I have no art dealer in 
Paris. (When I became 60, several German art dealers arranged a large exhibition, 
which they also sent on as a traveling show.) The answer is suggested: Someone can 
surely be found to take over the necessary worries (renting a hall, catalogue, publicity, 
invitations, etc.). However, it is hard to find money in Paris. 'Don't you have a maecenas 
who has the necessary 15-20,000 francs,' I am asked. Experts claim that with 15,000 



Francs the matter could be handled very nicely, and very swanky with 20. Aside of my 
'subjective' side the matter also has an 'objective' one. Here constantly this or that is 
done against 'non-figurative' painting, which has various different reasons. It is also bad 
that in this aggression the 'constructivists' are always mentioned; and it is therefore 
claimed: these non-figurative artists (the non-objective artists) are pure headaches, who 
deny the intuitive element and want to make something mechanical out of art. As you 
see a pell-mell and confusion. 

"I therefore thought, that if my anniversary would be utilized and an imposing exhibit 
would be held, which would be followed by a large exhibition of Bauer's work, our art 
would receive the proper light. The slanderers can only and exclusively be disarmed 
by facts. 

"I have friends here who are trying to get money for the exhibition. On the other hand I must 
say that a number of local art dealers have also 'caught a little fire' and though still 
hesitatingly, still they show some interest for the non-figurative and try to undertake this 
or that. They are always afraid that this art would be difficult (or impossible) to sell. 
However, since I sell here and at proper prices, which they first considered crazy and to 
which they now say 'You did well by not giving in,' I received several offers here and 
that almost immediately after I moved here. That is, an effort was made to barter and 
get me to reduce my prices. I said: 'No! I still have my bread and do not have to hurry 
with sales.' — 'Yes, but prices have been reduced in the entire world.' And I: 'Mine 
have also been reduced by 50%, that is, I have reduced my prices by 50%.' Many 
smiled at my tenacity, but now say, I was right. Of course, I would sell much more if I 
would give my works away 'for 1 5 or 1/10 of their prices.' 

"You will remember how cheaply you bought some works of well known artists from 
dealers. That is not only due to the fact that some art dealers are forced to sell the 
paintings so cheaply from their stock, but also that many artists themselves sell their 
works for a buttered sandwich (or, as the French say, 'for bread without butter'). In the 
case of some, I am very sorry to find that it is not a question of lack of character, but an 
actual lack of a piece of bread. It is bad, that here in Paris this really terrible situation 
is taken advantage of, by very wealthy people in the most ruthless manner. I know 
examples which cannot be considered anything but hair-raising. 

"On the other hand, there are also quite different facts, if they are facts. A short time 
ago there was a large exhibition of the newest paintings by Picasso, held by P. Rosenberg 
and I was informed from a good source that P. R. supposedly was forced to buy the 
entire collection, as otherwise Picasso would not give any paintings for an exhibition. 
And this good source claims that P. R. had placed roughly 1,000,000 Frs. on the table 
for this collection. Maybe the 'good source' had its legs pulled; so that such rumors would 
spread and the Picasso prices, which went down considerably, would go up again. I 
do not know. 



"I just see from my house catalogue that from the period 1916-20 I have only the one 
painting, 'In Grey.' That was the time of the war and the first years of the revolution, 
which I spent in Moscow. I would not want to experience such years again. 

"Aside of 'moral' shocks, I also experienced considerable financial shocks. Just before 
the revolution I was able to provide for myself financially, for the rest of my life. I was 
not rich, but had money enough to work without worrying, without having to think of 
earning money. This condition lasted only a few months. Later on, I even had to teach for 
14 years; something which I did not dislike doing, but which was very disadvantageous 
to my own work. You know as an artist, that for us only that is advantageous which allows 
us to think only of painting, think with head, soul and all other senses. However, I am 
happy that all these difficult conditions in the end did not keep me from making very 
important paintings. Self-praise!" 



Kandinsky to Hilla Rebay Paris, April 21, 1936 

"To my great pleasure the catalogue of the S. R. Guggenheim collection has finally arrived. 
I wish to thank you very much. Now, it is certain that the first copy sent by you has gotten 
lost. I am sorry that you had the trouble of again sending a new one — otherwise it 
would not be so bad now. 

"The catalogue is very beautifully done — my compliments! The reproductions are very 
well spread and well executed. The colored ones, as almost always, are a bit too 'bright,' 
'Almost always' means 'always' unless you spend an awful lot of money. The black and 
white ones could not have been better. And the pages with the little pictures look 'appe- 
tizing.' Typographically the catalogue as a whole looks serious and at the same time 
inviting. I like your text very much. The beginning with Copernicus and Galileo grasps the 
matter by its head. The example with the 'keyboard' is humiliating for the stupid ones 
but for 'head owners' or 'brain owners' (as Beethoven used to say) fully enlightening. I 
am sure that your text will make many a sceptic into an apostle. It is altogether simple, 
clear (without a 'painting kitchen') easily 'digestible' for the layman. In such cases so many 
'philosophical' expressions are used that the poor reader stands as though hit on the 
head (such hitting on the head is shown wonderfully in American films). Sometimes I really 
think that the philosophical art writer does not quite understand himself what he has 
written. Not alone the reader, but the art writer himself confronts the reader, both with 
open mouth, no longer knowing what is top or bottom. Do you know that the printer of 
the catalogue in one instance also did not know, what was top and what was bottom? 
Happy to say, only in one single case — that is the reproduction of 'For and Against,' 
catalogue number 90. Did you notice it afterwards?" 



Nuelly s. Seine, (Seine) October 16, 1936. 

135 Bd de la Seine, France 



Kandinsky to H. R. 

"You probably have been home for a long time now and, as usual, are working with full 
energy. 1 have been back from Italy only four weeks, where it was wonderful and where 
I have appparently collected enough strength for the coming winter. I hope that politics 
will not disturb the necessary inner quietude. 

"I received very interesting news from Germany which, as appears to me, are in certain 
connection with you. Thus I heard that Rudolf Bauer is on the hunt for 'non-objective 
paintings' in order, as I am told, to further strengthen the historic fundament of the 
Guggenheim collection. It would be wonderful! I presume this is in connection with the 
plans of which you have told me and which, of course, 'I shall keep to myself,' that is, I 
will not tell them to anyone. Here too 1 was asked for information in this connection, but 
said that I knew nothing of this. Here greatest care is essential. 

"Now I was also told from Germany that the Folkwang Museum (Essen) had sold a 
pre-war painting (Improvisation No. 8) to a Berlin art dealer, who had purchased the 
painting for a collector. Maybe I am all wrong if here too I think of the Guggenheim 
collection. At any rate, it would be hard to believe that the collector is a German. 

"In connection with this information I also thought of Otto Nebel, who, according to my 
idea, at least 'historically' belongs in the collection. Don't you believe so? I know that 
Bauer has a large water colour of his (bought it from him) and is therefore truly interested 
in his painting. In connection with the depreciations (of the French and Swiss Franc) I 
had some losses, but poor Nebel much more, something that took an almost catastrophical 
turn with him. Therefore, also from this angle, purchases from him would appear advis- 
able. I am saying this to you personally. 

"Don'tyou share my opinion? It would interest me very much to hear your opinion on this. 

"I do not need to tell you how much I am interested in the museum plans. Do you and 
Mr. G. have the intention to show the collection in New York (that is to the greater public) 
as it looks today, or do you want to wait until the Museum can become an actuality. The 
latter would bring about a nice 'explosion'! Did you receive our card from Forte dei 
Marmi? We often thought of you there. Your descriptions were more than confirmed. We 
lived there wonderfully in every respect in the Hotel Franceschi, which is now facing 
Viareggio and close to the sea. There were no foreigners, but everything was taken, so 
that we did not get the room we wanted from the start until we had moved four times. 
We tried to guess where the house is in which you lived with your friends. 



"Now comes the already well known request from me for photos of the latest paintings 
acquired and also the water colours which you bought from Neumann from my water 
colour exhibit as well as the three v/ater colours which you bought from me three years ago. 
It would be very important for me to have these photographs and I would appreciate 
them very much." 



Again to Hilla Rebay, January 16th, 1937: 

"According to your terminology, 'abstract' art operates with elements which were 'ab- 
stracted' from some object while 'non-objective' art creates its own elements without 
making use of any objects whatsoever. As that is the case, I do not understand why you 
term my painting 'abstract,' as the Guggenheim collection already has many of my 
paintings (even from the time before the war) which have nothing whatsoever to do with 
an object. How am I to understand that? . . . 

"in the letter which was lost I also mentioned that I could not immediately come to 'pure 
abstraction' because at that time I was all alone in the world. In spite of that, I had 
painted my first non-objective painting already in 1911, ('Peoples Museum' in Moscow). The 
Guggenheim Collection has non-objective paintings from me, painted in 1913 — 'Light 
Picture' (No. 68 of your catalogue) and 'Black Lines' (No. 69); also from the years 
1918, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, etc. Perhaps you consider all these remarks 'small.' It 
may be. These, however, are my achievements which are of importance when a charac- 
terization of my work is attempted. 

"You write (and not for the first time) that the spiritual is the important part, i believe 
that here we understand each other well; I had already written a book about this in 1910. 
I was particularly happy to find 'Fuge' (1914) among the photographs you sent. I con- 
sidered the painting completely lost." 



To Hilla Rebay in 1937: 

"I particularly draw the people's attention to your 'paper plastics' because I like them 
very much. I also suggested that they look at your portfolio and that of Bauer because 
the portfolios are beautifully done, and one could, at an advantageous price, buy works 
from both of you. It was quite often made clear to me (and I know this myself) that through 
such cooperation as a colleague, I spoil my 'reputation as an artist;' the artist should 
stand 'above everything' and should worry only and exclusively about himself. That 
is the way all the 'great' Parisians act. According to my opinion, however, there are 
also exceptions among real great people, which, however, are some of the greatest 
rarities. I actually have profited well — particularly morally, because many of my paint- 



ings are in a very valuable collection. Also from a monetary point of view, but perhaps 
somewhat less than you think because several (or many) of my paintings did not enter 
the G. collection through me but from other points and people. Excuse these perhaps small 
remarks. However, let us have confidence in each other. It is just this confidence that the 
world of today lacks so badly. Let us try as artists, to also in this direction, form an 
'island' in the terrible atmosphere of today. It wcjld be 'objectively' well, and not too 
bad 'subjectively' as it is easier to breathe in an air of confidence." 



To Solomon R. Guggenheim Paris 18.4.38 

"A few days ago I received the newest catalogue of the Sol. R. Guggenheim collection, 
now called foundation. I want to use this occasion to send you my congratulations upon 
your grandiose Resolution — Already it was such a precious deed when you as the very 
first, started a collection of almost entirely 'non-figurative' paintings and for years 
enlarged it consequently. While now in New York exists a public institution for this Art 
which in so innumerous creations has, now, been made accessible to the public in such 
a way. Incredible how slowly humanity converts to the new. In first declining energetically 
(by jove, the scolding one had to hear). They then slowly prick up the ears, until at last 
(yet it still takes its time) comes the insight. To this enlightenment your foundation now 
paves the way." 

Since 1934 Kandinsky lived in Paris, with the exception of a few trips to Italy, Egypt, 
Greece, Turkey or to the South of France; December 1 3th, 1 944, he died there after grave 
illness, very likely due to the privations of war conditions. Yet even bitter cold did not 
prevent him from painting, until death stopped him serving human ideals by bringing joy 
and ecstasy to a steadily growing number of people. Those, able to feel the beauty of 
Kandinsky's exquisite colours and the carefully organized perfection of counter point in 
his form and space solutions, the tender warmth of lyrical charm, contrasting the crystal 
clarity which prove his brilliant mastery. 

Kandinsky, the daring inventor of a new moving form ideal with which he so prophetically 
has lead into that future of a spirituality where past and present unite the everlasting 
future of eternity — In the last years of Kandinsky's life, his paintings became enormously 
sought after in Paris— His death occurred, as his wife cabled, during his last exhibition 
which, due to its "enormous success," had to be prolonged. 

Kandinsky had one man exhibitions in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen, Stockholm, 
Brussels, Dessau, Dresden, Cologne, Brunswick, New York, Zurich. His work is owned by 
museums and collections of Paris, Amsterdam, Erfurt, Chicago, Christiania, Kioto, London, 
Moscow, Stockholm, Solothurn, Vienna, Zurich, Basle, Brussels, Halle, The Hague, Cologne, 
Milan, Oslo, Copenhagen, Essen, Berlin, Dresden, Saarbruecken, Hamburg, Hanover, 



Wiesbaden, New York, Goeteborg, Philadelphia, New Haven, Los Angeles and many 
others — Museum directors of some of the aforementioned German cities under political pres- 
sure had been forced to sell priceless Kandinskys to Switzerland, which then were acquired 
for the Solomon R. Guggenheim collection, enriching it with historically priceless additions 
and so bringing to New York a complete survey of Kandinsky's remarkable achievement. 

This unique collection will be made accessible in its full entirety when the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation will have its collection permanently housed in the Gallery now 
planned by Frank Lloyd Wright, to be built after the war on Fifth Avenue and 89th Street. 
With this, a dream of Kandinsky is to come true; though he did not live to see it, he knew 
of it before he died. 

Not anything has been said of Kandinsky which is more fitting than that which Diego 
Rivera wrote in 1 933: "I know of nothing more real than the painting of Kandinsky — nor 
anything more true and nothing more beautiful. A painting of Kandinsky gives no image of 
earthly life — it is life itself. If one painter deserves the name 'creator,' it is he. He organizes 
matter as matter was organized, otherwise the Universe would not exist. He opened a 
new window to look inside of the All. Some day Kandinsky will be the best known and 
the best loved by men."
