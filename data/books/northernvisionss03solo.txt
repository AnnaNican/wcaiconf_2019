Acknowledgements 



The following expressions of gratitude are made in 
my own behalf and in that of my co-commissioner 
Pontus Hulten. The present exhibition and the 
publication of its accompanying catalogue could not 
have been successfully accomplished without the 
generous cooperation and assistance of numerous 
individuals and organizations. Firstly, gratitude is 
due to the Organizing Committee: Per Hovdenakk, 
Curator, Sonja Henie-Niels Onstad Foundations, 
Hovikodden, Norway, and Chairman of the Asger 
Jorn Foundation; Guy Atkins, author of the cata- 
logue-raisonne of Jorn's works and Honorary 
Secretary of the Asger Jorn Foundation; and Troels 
Andersen, Director, Silkeborg Kunstmuseum, Den- 
mark, and Honorary Secretary of the Asger Jorn 
Foundation. Their knowledge and expertise were 
essential. Without the knowledgeable participation 
of Mr. Atkins and Mr. Andersen the project could 
not have been accomplished. Together Mr. Atkins 
and Mr. Andersen made the selection of works in 
the exhibition. Mr. Atkins contributed the informa- 
tive documentation for the catalogue and saw the 
publication through the presses and Mr. Andersen 
wrote the cogent essay. Sincere thanks are extended 
to Louise Averill Svendsen, Senior Curator of the 
Guggenheim Museum, for her central contribution 
as coordinator of this project. 

We are greatly indebted as well to Steingrim 
Laursen of the Louisiana Museum, Humlebaek, 
Denmark, for his invaluable assistance and advice 
throughout. The efforts of virtually every depart- 
ment of the Guggenheim Museum were involved 
in this project, and the dedication and skill of staff 
members are therefore gratefully recognized. Our 
appreciation is also extended to the lenders, both 
private individuals and public institutions, of Jorn's 
works, whose willingness to part with their posses- 
sions is greatly appreciated. Except for those who 
wish to remain anonymous, lenders are cited else- 
where in this catalogue. The interest and participa- 



tion of the Barbican Center for Arts and Conferences, 
which will present the exhibition after its initial 
showing at the Guggenheim in New York, are 
hereby recognized. The following individuals should 
be singled out for thanks: Henry Wrong, Adminis- 
trator, Barbican Art Center; Godfrey Thompson, 
Director, Art Galleries; John Hoole, Curator, Bar- 
bican Art Gallery. We are grateful to Lund Humph- 
ries Publishers, London, for permission to use black 
and white reproductions and color separations from 
the oeuvre catalogue for Jorn's paintings. 

The realization of this exhibition and catalogue 
involved financial expenditures which could not 
have been borne without the generous sponsorship 
of the Danish Government Committee for Cultural 
Exchange and the assistance of the National Endow- 
ment for the Arts in Washington, D. C. Our sin- 
cerest gratitude is expressed to these agencies for 
their enlightened and crucial support.

duced Kafka to Danish readers. The Helhesten group included many

At the beginning of November the Cobra group was founded by 
Karel Appel, Constant, Corneille, Christian Dotremont (who became 
Secretary General), Jorn and Joseph Noiret. Cobra is an acronym from 
Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam. Its goal was to promote spon- 
taneity in art and to challenge the artistic monopoly of Paris. The 
movement lasted three years, with exhibitions, manifestoes, period- 
icals and short biographical monographs (edited by )orn) to docu- 
ment its theories. 

1949 

An important Cobra exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. 
A meeting of Cobra artists took place in a resthouse for architecture 
students, near Copenhagen (fig. 4). The Cobra painters had been given 
permission to carry out "decorations". They covered the whole intenor 
with murals that extended from the floor upwards and across the 
panels of the ceiling (fig. 5). Jorn's first marriage broke up in the 
summer, when he began a liaison with Matie van Domselaer.

1949-50 

Painted a series of Historical Pictures and War Visions and began the 

Aganak group of animal cartoons. 

1950-51 

Lived in great poverty on the outskirts of Paris for about six months. 
Developed severe tuberculosis, aggravated by undernourishment, 
and had to return to Denmark, where he spent seventeen months 
undergoing hospital treatment. Jorn married Matie in 1951. Wrote 
two books while in the hospital and worked on two cycles of paint- 
ings: The Seasons and On the Silent Myth. 

1953 

Made a large number of ceramics in Silkeborg and nearby. Took the 
important decision, at the end of October, to leave Denmark and seek 
his luck abroad. 

1953-54 

The winter was spent in recuperating in a pension in Switzerland. 



1954-1959 

1954-55 

Traveled to Albisola, Italy, in the spring of 1954 and made ceramics 
there with Appel, Enrico Baj, Corneille, Lucio Fontana, Matta and 
others (fig. 7). 

1956 

Acquired an apartment in Paris and prepared paintings for an ex- 
hibition at Galerie Rive Gauche the following year. 

1956-58 

Jorn's breakthrough to maturity as an artist belongs to this period. 

His international recognition can be said to date from 1958 when 

Lettre a monftls (cat. no. 9) was shown in 50 ans d'art moderne at Expo 

in Brussels. 

This painting held its own against canvases by de Kooning and other 

world ranking names. 

Published Pour la forme: Ebauche d'une methodologie da arts (bibl. no. 2) 

and played a leading part in the International Situationist movement 

(bibl. no. 8). 

1959 

Made a gigantic ceramic mural in Albisola in the summer and had it 

transported in the autumn to Aarhus in Denmark for reassembly. 

Began the Modifications series (sentimental old canvases bought in 

junk shops and overpainted), which he continued to produce until 

1963 (cat. no. 29). 

Started to enlarge the modern art collection at the Silkeborg Kunst- 

museum by generous donations of his own and other artists' works. 

This collection ultimately grew so large that a new building was 

opened this year to house it (bibl. no. 25). 

Jorn's concern from now on was to dodge "the great artistic success 

machine" (Cyril Connolly) by keeping out of the limelight and finding 

plausible schemes for spending unwanted money. 



1960-1967 

1960-63 

Luxury Paintings, using dribble techniques, were shown in London. 
In 1962 he was given a first one-man exhibition in New York. Made 
important collages and decollages which were shown in Munich and 
Paris. 

Resigns from the International Situationist movement and began to 
travel widely through Europe in search of Scandinavian art from 
prehistoric times to the early Middle Ages (bibl. no. 4). He accu- 
mulated about 15,000 original photographic negatives and prints 
which are now housed in the Silkeborg Kunstmuseum; some were 
published in three books on Viking art sponsored and financed by 
Jorn. 

1964 

First major international retrospective, primarily of paintings, at the 
Kunsthalle Basel, touring to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and 
the Louisiana Foundation in Humlebaek, Denmark. 
The artist's fiftieth birthday was marked by a first book on him in 
English, a bibliography of his writings and an illustrated study of the 
Aarhus ceramic mural (bibl. nos. 11-13). 

1965 

Short visit to Mexico and the United States.

1966 

This was an important year because Jorn began to concentrate again 

on painting, after a long period of distraction. He spent the summer 

in London preparing for an exhibition of oil paintings in London and 

of acrylics for New York. 

In the Beginning was the Image (cat. no. 44) was shown at the Salon de 

Mai in Paris. The title expresses a concept that was considered by Jorn 

to be fundamental. 



1967-1970 

1967 

Visited Cuba at the suggestion of Wifredo Lam (fig. 8). In Havana 
he painted the interior of a building, which had once been a bank, 
with large murals reproduced in Jorn/Cuba, 1970 (bibl. no. 16).

1968 

Jorn was in Paris at the time of the May riots. He made some small 
posters for the occasion but did not take an active part in the events. 
Published, jointly with Noel Arnaud, La langue verte et la cuite, 
a monumental satire on Claude Levi-Strauss (bibl. no. 6). 

1970 

Made colored woodcuts of outstanding quality in Munich. Traveled to 
the Linked States in the wake ot a successful exhibition in New York. 
There he met Nanna Enzensberger, whom he was later to marry. By 
now Jorn had settled in a spacious studio built to his own design in 
a house he had bought in Colombes on the outskirts of Paris (figs. 
9 and 10). There he painted a number ot masterpieces in large format, 
as well as smaller pieces (cat. nos. 50-61). The exhibition La luxure de 
I'esthesie, which took place in Paris late in the year, showed that Jorn 
was enjoying a renaissance ot his creative strength as a painter The 
years 1956-59 and 1969-72 were the high points of his artistic career.

1971-1973 



1972 

During the last phase of his lifejorn devoted his energies to sculpture. 
He made twenty-three bronzes and, at Carrara, six marble sculptures 
(bibl. no. 18). Most of the bronzes were figures representing humanoid 
personalities, with all the ambiguities of posture and gesture that 
characterize his paintings. 

1973 

In February a large and carefully chosen retrospective was presented 

by the Kestner-Gesellschaft. After Hannover its tour included Berlin, 

Brussels and two venues in Denmark. 

Jorn died of cancer in the Aarhus Municipal Hospital on May 1. 

The cremation took place in Denmark. His grave is in Gotland, the 

Swedish island he had visited several times to collect data for a book 

on Theodoric the Great. The book was published posthumously.

Troels Andersen, Director of the Silkeborg Museum of Art, 
here bridges the gap between Jorn's debut as an artist in the 
1930s and his achievement of maturity twenty years later. 

The exhibition, on the other hand, begins with the mature

Asgerjorn: 

The Formative Years 

byTroels Andersen 

Now that Jorn's work can be seen in perspective and 
viewed as a whole, he stands beside Edvard Munch as 
a major figure in Northern European painting. He was 
thirty in 1944 when Munch died, and their contributions 
are, of course, very different. Munch painted picture after 
picture of the lonely individual searching for com- 
panionship with his fellow men and with nature. For 
Munch these were the important human considerations. 
Whereas Jorn, always surrounded by others, examined 
his situation critically and with scepticism, irony and 
humor At the same time he sought to develop his 
Nordic vision within a long historical perspective. 

Not many of the articles written on )orn during his 
lifetime capture more than a fraction of his mental pro- 
cesses or modes of expression. But one of the statements 
which struck home came from Werner Haftmann (bibl. 
no. 10), who spoke of him as a "night person". Jorn pon- 
dered this phrase, which, he said, "shocked me enor- 
mously because my most conscious need is my longing 
for light". 

He was strongly aware of the conflicting approach to 
life, art and culture that prevailed in Northern as against 
Southern Europe. For him this factor constituted a vital 
field of energy and tension. In his posthumous work 
Alpha and Omega he wrote about the burning question 
of the Nordic element in his own art: 

"I don't know what Nordic art is worth in other 
people's minds . . . but in today's cosmopolitan art 
world it doesn't figure at all . . . Nordic art is danger- 
ous. It compresses all its power inside ourselves. It is 
not a hedonistic or sensuous art. It neither claims to 
be objectively intelligible, nor does it deal in clear and 
conscious symbols. The Danish author Jakob Knud- 
sen hit on something important when he said that 
Nordic art has mood and works on the mood more 
than on the senses or the understanding . . ." 
Throughout his life he came up against mutually ir- 
reconcilable attitudes and alternatives, in art as well as in 
life. He most often tended to avoid a choice, preferring 
to seek a solution or to free himself through the con- 
frontation. He saw himself as the eternal wanderer and 
survivor, as Buttadeo, a head on legs (fig. ll). 



"A prisoner of his time" was how an American critic 
labelled Jorn a few years after his death. But, it must be 
added, one of the few able to escape and survive. 

After 1930 a new generation began to break ground in 
European art. These artists were born just before the 
First World War (and they inherited a no-man's-land). 
On the one side were groups which had striven for 
novelty during the twenties. On the other were those 
who wanted to preserve "the traditional values" in spite 
of the unstable situation. This dichotomy was reflected 
in architecture where traditional concepts of style and 
craftsmanship were confronted by functionalism; or in 
painting where, for example, Italian metaphysicians con- 
verted to a new classicism. As regards Germany, Oskar 
Schlemmer's Bauhaus wall decorations were, in 1930, 
painted over at the request of the man who, some years 
later, headed the campaign against "degenerate art". Con- 
fidence in dynamic change and progress, which had 
marked artistic as well as social attitudes in Europe, 
disappeared - even in the Scandinavian countries. But 
the Scandinavians, as often before, followed a different 
path from their Southern neighbors. 

The new generation of artists in Denmark continued 
to practise a form of art which was to be suppressed in

Germany from the time of the Nazi takeover. The young 
Danes mounted two large international exhibitions in 
Copenhagen, Cubism-Surrealism in 1935 and Linien (The 
Line) in 1937. These can be compared with the two im- 
portant New York shows of 1936: Cubism ami Abstract 
Art and Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism. These four 
exhibitions were the biggest pre-war surveys of modern 
European art (whose sky was soon to be blacked out). 
The young Danish artists had managed to bring to- 
gether a selection of outstanding works by Kandinsky, 
Mondrian, Klee, Arp, Dali,Tanguy, Ernst, Miro and 
others. Their own works hung alongside those of the 
European masters whom they had themselves visited in 
studios and galleries in Paris. 

The two Danish exhibitions were unique in their 
composition and quality (though the artistic level was 
in inverse ratio to the public response!). The shows were 
not only the result of direct contact with the most im- 
portant artistic ideas of the interwar years, but they also 
showed that lessons had been learnt from these contacts. 
For instance, the new generation in Denmark did not 
find it necessary to choose between the opposing schools 
of the twenties. What had been separated into two 
exhibitions in New York was here, in both shows, 
merged. Admittedly, the 1935 exhibition was partly 
tracing the development from Cubism to Surrealism and 
partly programmatically Surrealist, but the 1937 Line 
show demonstrated clearly that the movements were 
seen as being parallel. To the young Danes, Kandinsky's 
abstract works and Tangu/s unreal beaches, Giacomet- 
ti's figures and Miro's signs were all equally attractive. 

The Line group included the painters Richard Morten- 
sen, Ejler Bille, Carl-Henning Pedersen, Egill Jacobsen 
and the sculptor Sonja Ferlov Mancoba. At the 1937 
exhibition they were joined by a young provincial, 
a couple of years younger than themselves, called Asger 
Jorgensen, later known as Jorn. 

Jorn came from an area of Jutland that was bereft of 
art. Jorn's father, faced with the choice of being either 
a preacher or a teacher chose the latter He married 
another teacher, had six children, and died early. Because 
the children were to receive the same education as their 
parents, the family moved to the town of Silkeborg in 
Central Jutland in 1929. Silkeborg was a town with 
a railway station, over 5,000 inhabitants, and in that 
alone quite different from the villages where the family 
had lived so far. In Silkeborg there were two newspapers,

Asger is in the back row on the left 



a good library, several schools, a teacher training college, 
and even a circle of artists, gathered around the painter 
Martin Kaalundj0rgensen.jorn quickly attached him- 
self to this artist and began to paint under the influence 
of his powerful, expressionistic style. A critic's comment 
on one of Kaalund's main works, a large portrait which 
Jorn remembered many years later, said: 

"The picture is the most natural, the simplest thing 
in the world, a happy outpouring of male strength 
and spirit. It is painted with palette knife and broad 
brush, a violent simplification of form and a high 
concentration of color. The remarkable thing is that 
this picture, so tough and direct in approach, slowly 
rises before one's eye, then moves away in space and 
time . . ." 
From such an encounter with form and style, marked by 
influences from Cezanne, van Gogh and Munch, Jorn 
began to paint portraits and landscapes of his own. 
He made his debut in Silkeborg in 1933 with two small 
paintings, one of which was a portrait of the syndicalist 



20 



and workers' leader Christian Christensen, who was to 
be of lifelong significance tojorn. In the mid-sixties, 
in gratitude for the philosophical and political insights 
he had received, Jorn erected a large memorial stone to 
Christian Christensen in Silkeborg (fig. 13). 

Jorn's first graphic works also date from 1933. They 
were a set of strongly politico-satirical engravings which 
exposed the crude side of some of the traditional carols 
and hymns which were (and still are) an important ele- 
ment in the folk culture of Central and West Jutland. 

With his teacher training finished in 1935 Jorn went, 
the following year, to Paris. He had hoped to study 
under Kandinsky, but this was not possible since Kan- 
dinsky had no "school". So he went instead to Fernand 
Leger. There he met an attitude to painting which was 
in strong contrast to the Expressionism he had known 




Fig. 14 Arriving in Paris in 1936, according to a lithograph by 
Henry Heerup 




Fig. 13 Jorn made a memorial stone for Christian Christensen in 
1963 



up to that time. In a letter from 1952 he wrote of his 
impressions of Leger' s teaching: 

"One day Pierre Loeb said to me that the ideal pic- 
ture is one which is completely clear in the artist's 
mind before he puts a mark on the canvas, and this 
was, at any rate in this period . . . Lego's opinion. 
It is the basis on which classical art is built. Therefore 
the setting-down of the picture on the canvas is in 
itself something quite unimportant. This is connected 
with Lego's hatred of textural effects in painting. 
But I love these effects. I remember that I was once 
told off because I had applied a thick layer of color 
instead of the thin and even layer that Leger wanted. 
To him that was not painting but mere color If he 
could have got a machine instead of a brush to apply 
the color, he would have done so." 
Leger got Jorn several commissions in order to help him 
both financially and artistically. Amongst other works 
Jorn, with two other pupils, was responsible for the 
execution of Lego's large composition Le transport des 
forces in 1937. Jorn painted the large soft forms which 
move upwards through the picture. Traces of these forms 
can be seen distinctly in Jorn's own compositions from 
the same year. 

Thanks to Leger, Jorn assisted Le Corbusier on the 
Pavilion des temps nouveaux at the 1937 Paris World's Fair. 
Jorn had to enlarge a child's drawing to a big format, 
to be used at the entrance to the pavilion. 

Rene Renne and Claude Serbanne were among the 
first critics to write extensively about Jorn (in bibl. no. 23).

They noted the satirical element in many of his works 
from the late thirties : 

"Like Miro before him he uses an uncompromising 

graphic line to produce a caricature image which is 

caustic and dry" (bibl. no. 23, p. 78). 
Jorn, however, did not allow himself to get trapped 
either in satire or in the abstract movement's penchant 
for line and pure form. He merely toyed with these pos- 
sibilities. In some of his sketchbooks from 1936-37 he 
practised the motifs and compositions he had found in 
Kandinsky, El Lissitsky and De Stijl. The sketches are 
drawn with a ruler and compass in India ink, and titled 
on the notebook covers: Essays in planes and basic forms 
and Tensions between straight and curved lines. 
Sometimes Jorn borrowed a particular feature of Leger's 
technique, as when he tinted a canvas in order to work 
on a colored or tinted base instead of the white gesso. 
The components of the picture were then imposed on 
this background either as linear shapes or as outlines 
colored in. The forms could be modeled plastically or 
the plane could be emphasized. 

Textural asceticism went against the grain and Jorn 
also fretted at being made to correlate line and form, 
but he did not yet know how to free himself from these 
restrictions. One method was to work with accidental 
shapes, and this was to become a lifelong preoccupation. 
But in the beginning the techniques of Surrealism were 
put to good use: collage, frottage, color sprayed on paper 
with an airbrush or floated on the surface of a bowl of 
water and lifted off on paper (fig. 15). Another way to 
break the link between line and plane was by what Arp 
called the "square-eyed" method or alternately, with Dali, 
putting one drawing on top of another, using transparent 
paper. Jorn had availed himself of all these methods and 
experiments by 1940. 

He used collage for a set of unpublished illustrations 
for The Stolen Chest of Drawers, a book by the Danish 
poet Jens August Schade. Schade had created a glittering 
narrative that roamed all over the globe, in the air and 
on land simultaneously, in the subconscious and in 
realistic environments. Jorn merely had to take him 
literally! And if the collages resembled those of the Sur- 
realists (especially perhaps Ernst's Une semaine de bonte 
or Lafemme cent tetes. which had inspired the young 
Danish artists from the time they were first published) 
they are at the same time completely compatible with 
Schade's lyrical prose (bibl. no. 23, p. 60). 




?ig. 15 The Girl in Search of Life, a "flottage" monoprint from 1938 



Jorn used Dali's overlay technique in order to dissolve 
the shapes of his drawings, not to evoke clashes between 
the shapes. Later in the forties he was glad that he could 
use this method in his encounter with the Danish psy- 
choanalyst Sigurd Naesgaard, who took it upon himself 
to relate various shapes he found in Danish abstract art 
to specific psychological "complexes". (In this Naesgaard 
was partly influenced by Wilhelm Reich, who had stayed 
a short while in Denmark and whose lectures had been 
attended by some of the Line artists). Jorn had certainly 
been under analysis with several of Naesgaard's pupils 
and possibly the man himself, but he nevertheless reacted 
against Nassgaard's interpretation of art. 

To test Naesgaard's thesis, Jorn took one of his own 
drawings with a complex interlaced pattern and he then 
asked a number of artists to pick out what they con- 
sidered to be the basic pattern (fig. 16). They drawing had 
been produced almost automatically and ought therefore 
to contain some "basic" feature. In the event Jorn re- 



22 



ceived as many different "basic patterns" as there were 
artists! Whatever the basic theme (if any) might be it 
was impossible to isolate it. 

Jorn attached great importance to this experiment. 
Even after he had published the results in an article, 
he continued with his inquiries. He drew the attention 
of Renne and Serbanne to the matter when they were 
writing about his drawings in the late forties and he 
explained the experiment to Guy Atkins in the sixties 
(bibl. no. 15, pp. 45-48).Jorris basic conclusion was that 
a picture is essentially ambivalent. It is not susceptible 
to just one particular interpretation or reading. This 
insight carried him beyond satire and beyond the dog- 
matic non-figurative attitudes at the beginning of his 
careen Moreover, it was the principal point of view he 
was to develop consciously in his works of the fifties 
and sixties. 

"Groupez-vous", said Leger to Scandinavian pupils in the 
twenties when they left Paris to return home. Jorn did 




not need Leger's prompting. In The Line he had seen an 
example of how mutual discussion and a vigorous ex- 
change of ideas had enlivened and transformed the 
Danish art scene. But already at that first exhibition in 
1937 he found himself at loggerheads with the outstand- 
ing personality in the group, Richard Mortensen. Jorris

Fig. 17 The Blue Picture, 1940, influenced by Ejler Bille 



own position was much closer to one of the other lead- 
ing members, Ejler Bille. In the early forties Bille devel- 
oped a free allover manner of composition which made 
a great impact on Jorn (fig. 17). Bille was also a critic, 
and at the end of the war he published a collection of 
articles ranging from Oceanic art to Henri Laurens, 
Picasso and the Surrealists. 

Jorn often joined forces with other artists in exhibi- 
tions, magazines or in sharing studios, but as one of his 
contemporaries said, "He was not really a 'group per- 
son'. He was an egocentric who could do everything by 
himself, but only after things had developed to the point 
where there was no longer any need for a group." 

During the war Jorn was the driving force behind the 
publication of the magazine Helhesten (The Hell Horse). 
It printed articles on art, literature, archaeology, film, 
ethnography, etc. When the first number came out 
nobody knew what would be the attitude of the Ger- 
man occupation forces. The number contained an obitu- 



23 



ary on Paul Klee, whose pictures had been removed 
from German galleries and destroyed. Moreover, the 
name of the magazine contained (to the initiated) a sly 
dig at the German occupying power. But, due to the 
prevailing cultural confusion, nobody interfered with the 
magazine which ran until 1944 when it ceased public- 
ation for financial reasons. 

Few of the articles in The Hell Horse have any value as 
original research, but today they give a vivid impression 
of a particular circle of people and their interests. The 
mixture of original lithographs coupled with reproduc- 
tions and the breadth of subject matter later inspired 
the Dutch Reflex magazine and the international Cobra 
review. 

Five years without a chance to travel abroad, without 
foreign exhibitions or information on art events in other 
countries, combined with the pressure placed on every- 
one by the war, produced a closeknit community of ar- 
tists in Denmark. It was not only artists of the same 
generation who came closer together, but the bond 
managed to span the generation gap. In his notes from 
those years Jorn proposed the idea of combining fea- 
tures of Danish art from the twenties and thirties with 
the Abstract and Surrealist styles. The Danish art to 
which he was referring was based on simplified land- 
scape painting with a strong emphasis on colon 

It was not unnatural (in view of what has been said) 
that the "spontaneous abstract" group should exhibit 
jointly with a number of figurative artists in the Corner 
Hest art association during and just after the war At the 
end of the war this association received a questionnaire 
from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The 
Museum was trying to piece together a picture of what 
had been happening in those countries with whom 
contact had been lost during the wan Jorn applied him- 
self with enthusiasm to answering the questionnaire. 
He collected photographs as well as some original works 
to send off. The Danish association compiled a state- 
ment which summarized their views on the develop- 
ments that had taken place. 

The text which clearly bears the stamp of Jorn's ideas 
drew a distinction between "automatic" abstraction and 
"constructive" abstraction. The text ran: 

"The greatest difficulty arose when transferring the 

spontaneous method from drawing to painting. 
If the picture were to be drawn on the canvas spon- 
taneously then the color would inevitably be trapped 



inside the drawing and unable to expand naturally. 
Our most difficult and inportant achievement, which 
has given our art its special flavor, is the breakthrough 
to a liberation of the color element, and so to painterly 
spontaneity." 
Jorn was also looking for what he called an "empty 
creation". In a conversation he told Pierre Loeb that his 
own goal was "to be completely empty of ideas at the 
moment of setting brush to canvas, the head being just 
as empty as the canvas". Renne and Serbanne touch on 
the same attitude - undoubtedly with one ofjorris 
examples in mind - in their text of 1947. 

"A child draws and paints alongside itself, on a. parallel 
course. In doing so it neither liberates nor deliberates; 
the child is not creating, the object itself is creating; 
it's not a matter of internal necessity (Kandinsky), but 
of external necessity, which may in fact be the truer 
of the two. 
"Alongside pure creation, i.e. empty creation (which is 
devoid of art), there exists a conscious creation (even if 
it's of an automatic order) . . ." (in bibl. no. 23, p. 77). 

Serbanne and Renne then quote Ernst who presented 
the problem in the opposite way. In his picture "Sur- 
realism and painting" a mythical gargoyle traces a suc- 
cession of straight lines and curves on a canvas to re- 
present "pure design". At this stage Jorn adheres to auto- 
matism and ambiguity as his guidelines, in preference to 
using motifs and figures as carriers of meaning. In 1947 
Jorn wrote of modern art in Paris: 

"It seems to me that today the Surrealist crisis is the 
central problem in French art. It is essential for future 
development that this crisis should be solved . . . 
The principal error in the aesthetic program of Sur- 
realism is that it is too literary. Painters have experi- 
mented with visions, images, dreams, but not with 
painting, not with color . . . The unpainterliness of 
Surrealism has inevitably produced a reaction among 
younger painters." 
Here he was not thinking of Danish artists, but of paint- 
ers such as Bazaine, Esteve, Lapique, Singier and Le Moil. 
He suggest there should be reciprocity: "These artists 
cannot get any further unless they absorb the lessons of 
Surrealism into their painting, just as Surrealists can only 
advance if they adopt the painterly methods of the other 
group." 

This was Jorn's position in 1947 when he joined in the 
debate that was taking place within the French Surrealist 



24 




Fig. 18 On the Silent Myth, Opus 4b, a coloured lithograph from 1952 



movements, e.g. Surrealisme-Re'volutionnaire. A year later 
he walked out of an art conference in Paris. With a hand- 
ful of Dutchmen, Belgians and a single Frenchman the 
Cobra group (COpenhague-BRuxelles -Amsterdam) was 
formed. Among the founders were Appel, Constant and 
the author Christian Dotremont. Jorn's aim in Cobra was 
to merge the Danish notion of "spontaneous abstraction" 
with the "painterly" aesthetic. 

In the many thousands of pages of Jorn's writings one 
looks more or less in vain for any substantial reference 
that would explain the content or context of most of his 
paintings from the fifties and sixties. The problem of 




"empty creation" with which he had struggled during 
the period before Cobra now gave way to dominant 
"figures" and "motifs" which obtruded themselves even 
before the picture was born. Time after time these char- 
acters interfered in the automatic process. 

In 1952-53 Jorn painted three pictures as a "decora- 
tion" for the Library at Silkeborg. Two of them were cal- 
led On the Silent Myth and the other The Wheel of Life. 
Many private symbols and references were incorporated 
in these paintings. The large number of sketches and 
smaller related studies point to a longstanding preoc- 
cupation with particular themes (fig. 19). In his speech 
when he presented the pictures to the Library he referred 
to Johannes V.Jensen, the Danish writer of novels that 
combined history with legend. Against the vocal myth 
Jorn set the silent myth, i. e. the visual image. 

Around this time Jorn came under the renewed in- 
fluence of Munch. In On the Silent Myth there are traces 
of Munch' s landscapes, especially in the way in which 
the forms are enclosed within colored contours and in 
the choice of the actual colors. Other pictures from the

same period, e.g. Manly Resistance (fig. 20), are also 
reminiscent of Munch, whose memorial exhibition in 
Copenhagen in 1946 had made a powerful impression 
at the time. The grouping of pictures into thematic 
cycles also points to Munch. 

In his commentary on the Silent Myth series Jorn again 
rejected the idea that a picture could be explained by its 
content or interpreted in a single direction. Yet from this 
time onward a new set of figures which could be called 
"recognizable" begin to appear in his paintings. 

In 1953 he made a small ceramic vase with four fig- 
ures, which he gave to his wife. The figures can be read 
clearly as two adults and two children. One of the figures 
is haggard with a kind of gash in its chest, a reference to 
Jorn's recent recovery from severe tuberculosis. The 
mother-and-children theme also runs through several 
paintings and drawings. Picture titles such as En Famille, 
You were like that (with a portrait of the artist's mother) 
(fig. 21) and Letter to my Son (cat. no. 9) show that the 
private sphere is directly involved. In picture after picture 
one finds distinct and recognizable types of "the father" 
and "the child". One of the figures in Letter to my Son 
the frequently recurrent "spectator", is repeated in an 
independent lithograph (fig. 22). 

In some versions Jorn looks at family life ironically as 
a source of discord and conflict (fig. 23), mitigated by 
the need for co-existence, as in the child-adult relation- 
ship. Lovers are shown as alternately hostile and affect- 
ionate, with a shifting dominance between the two 
partners. 



Now and then ironical and satirical overtones occur 
as in Unwelcome Visit or Doggie to Missie, which are seen 
elsewhere with menace, e.g. Attention Danger (cat. no. 13). 
This type of reference culminated around 1956-58. 

"Portraits" of known and unknown persons (col- 
lectors, art dealers, artists and friends) contain references 
that are sometimes private and esoteric but more often 
open. 

An interesting case is his portrayal of the French 
literary historian and philosopher Gaston Bachelard, 
to which he returned no fewer than three times (fig. 26). 
Each picture is like the memory of a person whose 
features one is trying to recall. The face floats before the 
inner eye without sharp definition yet with a convincing 
"likeness". The portrait of his mother You were like that 
is painted in the same way. 

Such factors point to Jorn's kinship with Nordic Ex- 
pressionism, of which he became more aware after he left 
Denmark in 1953.

The serious bout of illness at the beginning of the 
fifties left its mark onjorris temperament. In a letter to 
Werner Haftmann in the early sixties he referred to a 
composition from 1952 called The Eagle's Share, to which 
he returned in a series of versions. This painting, he said, 
expressed anxiety at several levels, personal and universal 
(fig. 27). 

In Alpha and Omega he said about the Nordic concept 
of Expressionism : 

"Nordic art casts a spell on the mind which ranges 
from laughter to tears and from tears to violent rage. 
One can see how dangerous it is, we can be tyrannized 
by a cynical person endowed with the power fo art. 
Munch has been said about this demonic aspect. In it 
lies the ultimate demand that the artist must take 
responsibility for the states of mind that he produces, 
or at least he must answer for them by knowing them 
in his own person. This psychic demand in both the 
artist and the viewer has made Expressionist art so 
hated by devotees of aestheticism and formalism." 

Jorn had hardly come to terms with his figurative re- 
pertoire when he began to feel hostile towards it. He 
often returned and overpainted parts of a picture: usually 
only the edges or background of a canvas, but he was 
capable of throwing synthetic paint over parts of the 
figure compositions (during the fifties) in a quasi- 
destructive gesture. A prime target was his big com- 
position from 1956, The Retreat from Russia (La ritirata di 
Russia). A year later he obliterated the whole surface 
under a layer of white, which he applied with a roller or 
similar implement. From now on subject matter and

style became more closely equated. After several years 
of workjorn finally gave the picture its title Stalingrad 
(fig. 28). 

The starting point in 1956 had been the stories told 
to him by an Italian friend, Umberto Gambetta, who 
had served with an Italian regiment in front of Stalin- 
grad. Afterwards followed years of detention in Russian 
prisoner-of-war camps - experiences that few men 
survived. References to these events were recorded on 
the original canvas (now obliterated) causing Gambetta 
to speak of the picture as "my portrait". Jorn thereupon 
blotted out the specific personal references in order to 
increase the universal validity of the painting. He often 
returned to this canvas, the last time being a few months 
before his death, when he added a series of black dots 
(representing houses) to the troubled scene. 

Stalingrad is a work, perhaps Jorris only one, which is 
marked by pathos. The opposite applies to the experi- 
ments he made from 1959 onwards in overpainting old 
pictures bought in the flea market. The first series con- 
sisted of landscapes peopled by fantastic monsters and 
other intruders. In his notebook Jorn called these pic- 
tures "kitsch", and it was only later that they got their 
French name, Modifications. In 1962 he exhibited a new 
series consisting exclusively of portraits in which the 
amiable physiognomies of the bourgeoisie were trans- 
formed into ill-favored grotesques (fig. 29). The women 
were surrounded by snarling beasts which beset them or 
swallowed them up, transforming them into one of

Jorn's favourite themes "the animal in woman". The pic- 
tures were intended as a provocation, which gives some 
of them an unprecedented severity which still has

a strong effect. Jorn also satirised the concept of the 
avant-garde: in one of the pictures a girl candidate for 
confirmation is given a moustache, and on the wall be- 
hind her, addressed to admirers of Duchamp, is written 
The avant-garde does not surrender (1'avant-garde ne se 
rend pas). The "modifications" had the curious side effect 
of alienating Jorn once more from figuration. This can be 
seen in a series from the early sixties, which he called 
Luxury Paintings. 

In the Luxury Paintings Jorn, fully conscious of the 
timelag, took up features from action painting and 
tachisme. He used synthetic paint, which he poured or 
dripped over the canvas or applied with string dipped 
in color (fig. 30). Nearly all these pictures lie on the 
extreme borderline of figuration. Jorn is here combining

Human Beast series of 1962

former notions of the "empty" creation and automatism 
with his current aesthetic. When figures were on the 
point of emerging, he refrained from clarifying them, 
so that they remained in the shadowland of the sub- 
conscious. 

He also used the Luxury Paintings to explore notions 
on color theory, for instance by reducing the main colors 
in relation to subsidiary ones. These notions were in- 
spired partly by an essay of 1890 on the nature of color by 
the Danish art historian Julius Lange and partly by the 
theories of Philipp Otto Runge earlier in the nineteenth 
century. While he was working on the Luxury Paintings, 
he was discussing these topics in his book De divisione 
naturae (in bibl. no. 5). 

Jorn's many experiments were not undertaken at 
random. He would deliberately return to subjects and 
problems which he had abandoned in an earlier phase. 
In the pictures of the sixties and seventies he moved freely 
between alternatives such as figuration and automatism, 
mythic figuration and improvisation, not in classical 
composure but in dynamic tension. 

In his later mature works it is often not at all easy to 
identify elements that are related to actual events, but 



29 



a biographical element of some sort is nevertheless 
seldom far away. When irony and satire are involved, 
they are as a rule so sensuously embedded in the color, 
fabric and composition that the result rises above the 
"occasion". The misogynistic and misanthropic view of 
human relations shown in many of the works of the 
early fifties has later lost its bitterness and self-irony. 

In the best works of the sixties until the artist's death, 
color has at last achieved the autonomy which he had so 
long sought. Now it is the surge of color that dictates 
the composition - color which in the late works is 
cleaner and stronger than ever before. Now and then 
broad brushstrokes appear, done with a brush the same 
size as that used byjapanese calligraphers. Line drawing 
is often introduced as a final stage, with pure color ap- 
plied straight from the tube to bring out a figure. Some- 
times a painting is as clearly built up as in certain litho- 
graphs: the base is first tinted, then each individual color 
is disposed in different areas of the plane, as if applied on 
different stones. The packed, texturally aggressive can- 
vases are rare in the last years. It is more a shift in vis- 
cosity from a thin turpentine-fluid color to a denser sur- 
face controlled by the palette knife - variations within 
a limited range. 

In the last years, too,Jorn moved over to other media: 
lithography, engraving, woodcut and, in the very last year, 
to sculpture modeled in clay and cast in bronze or carved 
from marble. These figures, too, by presenting a different 
aspect from every new angle, demonstrated Jorn's extra- 
ordinary power of vision, that enabled him to conjure 
up endless fresh images.

The Asger Jorn Foundation 

The Foundation was &lt;et up in 1974 with offices in Norway, Denmark ami England. 
An international council of nine members has acted at an advisory panel. 
The first task was to ensure the continuation of the oeuvre catalogue of font's 
paintings, of which only Volume 1 had appeared at the time of the artist's death. 
Volumes 2 and 3 have now duly completed the series. 

Main functions 

The Foundation has been responsible for scrutinising u vrks of art attributed to Jorn, 
with a view to authentication or rejection. The Foundation keeps a record of those 
works by jorn which have come to light since the publication of the oeuvre catalogue. 

Projects sponsored during the past eight years have included: 

1. Assistance in the making of a 16 mm film on Jorn by PerKirkeby, the Danish artist 
and film director. 

2. The issue of an interest-free loan to the Silkeborg Museum of Art for tin purchase of 
a major painting by Jorn entitledPnest on the Beach from 1957-59: and the gift 
of a Seasons painting from 1941-42 to mark the opening of the new museum 
building in 1982. 

3. The financing of stipends and travel grants to various persons working on topia 
related to Jorn, e.g. Jorn' s writings (Anneli Fuchs, Denmark): the COBRA 
movement (Anne Williamson, U.S.A.): Danish art from 1931-51 (Peter Shield, 
England); Jorn in Italy (Ursula Lehmann-Brockbaus, Rome). 

Future plans include the re-issue by subscription of the first volume of the oeuvre 
catalogue entitled 'Jorn in Scandinavia which has long been out of print. Anyone 
wishing to subscribe for a copy of this book should write for information to the 
Silkeborg Kunstmuseum. Box 34, 8600 Silkeborg, Denmark. 

Financial 

The Foundation's main source of income has been the sale of the Pour Jorn album of 
lithographs donated by 14 artists who were closely associated with Jorn. Since then 
other artist friends have made similar gifts. 

The committee has plans for the future which will require additional funding. 
Individual donations u ould therefore be most welcome and should be addressed to 
The Asger Jorn Foundation (a/c no. 21-01-30). Kjabenhavns Handelsbank. 
Ho/men's Kanal 2, Copenhagen K., Denmark.

Sponsor's Statement 



Artists of the mid-twentieth century, living as they do in a period of 
widely ranging cultural influences and widely fluctuating socio-economic 
patterns, have turned to new techniques and materials in their search for 
artistic identity. Scandinavian artists have responded to societal changes in 
an intensely individualistic way that accepts the positive values of this 
global input without rejecting the rich history and folklore of their own 
countries. 

The freedom with which they use the great flood of available new in- 
formation while continuing to live within their tradition seems to us to be 
particularly appropriate and valuable today. 

It is therefore a great pleasure for us to be able to contribute to the 
realization of the Sleeping Beauty-Art Now exhibition, which focuses on 
the work of a number of young Scandinavian artists, each of whom in a 
unique and personal style has told us something new about who we are 
and what possibilities are open to us.

Acknowledgments 



The following expressions of gratitude are made in my own behalf and in that of my 
co-commissioner Pontus Hulten. 

Our grateful acknowledgment is due first to Bjorn Springfeldt, Senior Curator of the 
Moderna Museet, Stockholm, who acted as Nordic coordinator of the exhibition and also 
edited the catalogue. 

It would not have been possible to arrange this exhibition, Sleeping Beauty— Art Now, 
without the generosity extended by a number of artists and museum representatives both 
in Scandinavia and in other countries. To all these we offer our deep appreciation. 

We would like to acknowledge the fact that the Nordic Council of Ministers provided 
the funding for the preparation of the exhibition. The work of various individuals and 
institutions in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States was 
coordinated by the Secretariat for Nordic Cultural Cooperation with efficiency and 
diplomacy. In an enterprise of this magnitude, bringing together artists and cultural 
institutions in six countries, there is always a risk that the artistic content of a project will 
be diminished. 

However, under the guidance of Carl Tomas Edam, Secretary General of SCANDINA- 
VIA TODAY at the Secretariat for Nordic Cultural Cooperation, it has been possible to 
solve all major problems in this regard and consequently foster the interest of the artists 
and their works. To him and his staff of Bente Noyons and Birgitta Schreiber we owe a 
great debt. 

We are grateful to Mrs. Birgitta Lonnell, Press Attache, Swedish Information Service, 
New York, for all her help. Oystein Hjort accepted the difficult task of outlining the 
artist's social and economical situation in Scandinavia for which we owe him great debt. 
Ake Larsson undertook the coordination of all transportations and solved all problems 
involved in a way we are most grateful for. 

Sincere thanks are extended to Louise Averill Svendsen, Senior Curator of the Guggen- 
heim Museum, for her central contribution as Coordinator of the exhibitions Asger Jorn, 
Oyvind Fahlstrom and Sleeping Beauty— Art Now in the presentation of Scandinavia 
Today at the Guggenheim. 

The efforts of virtually every departement of the Guggenheim Museum were involved in 
this project, and the dedication and skill of staff members are therefore gratefully recog- 
nized. Our appreciation is also extended to the lenders, both private individuals and public 
institutions, whose willingness to part with their possessions is greatly appreciated. Except 
for those who wish to remain anonymous, lenders are cited on the preceding page. 

Our hearty thanks go to Lennart Landin in Uddevalla, Sweden,- for masterly designing 
the catalogue. Our gratitude also goes to Claes Oldenburg for his willingness in rendering 
Scandinavia for the cover of this publication. 

The organization of SCANDINAVIA TODAY on the American side could not have 
been accomplished without the administrative framework and willing support of The 
American-Scandinavian Foundation. Individual as well as collective encouragement for the 



program came from museum directors, curators, administrators and technical support staff 
who lent their expertise, experience and enthusiasm. 

We would be at fault, however, if particular recognition were not given to those 
responsible for the entire SCANDINAVIA TODAY program: to Patricia McFate, Presi- 
dent of The American-Scandinavian Foundation, who secured funding and set program 
policy in the United States; to Brooke Lappin, who guided and directed the SCANDINA- 
VIA TODAY program; to Bruce Kellerhouse, who coordinated all of the program 
activities; and to Albina De Meio, who undertook liaison work between the Nordic side 
and all participating American museums. Without the support and talents of these highly 
skilled professionals, the SCANDINAVIA TODAY program could not have evolved. 

The exhibition Sleeping Beauty— Art Nov.' will, after it's showing in New York, go to 
Philadelphia and to Los Angeles. We want to extend our gratitude to Mr. Ronald L. 
Barber, Director of Port of History Museum, Penn's Landing, Philadelphia and to Mrs. 
Josine Ianco-Starrels, Director of the Municipal Art Gallery in Los Angeles. We thank 
them for their interest, help and cooperation.

Halldor Kiljan Laxness (1902- ) 
Icelandic author 

The reason why the Scandinavian countries — Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and 
Sweden-are grouped together is that they are all situated in one corner of Europe, and they 
are all small in terms of population. Their modern history is, however, not parallel at all. 
And one can question if their contemporary culture is very coherent. Four countries speak 
more or less similar languages of Germanic root, but the Finns speak a totally different 
language which is not Indo-European in origin. 

With some effort, one can, however, establish a list of common elements and factors in 
their respective cultures of today, most of them related to the light, the climate, in some 
cases a common ethnic origin and older cultural links, going more or less far back into 
history. On the other hand, although Danes and Swedes have not been separated into two 
distinct countries for more than about a thousand years, and Swedes and Norwegians less 
than one hundred years, there is in many cases no difficulty in distinguishing a Dane, an 
Icelander, a Norwegian and a Swede by facial expressions, movement patterns, and their 
general behavior before they have opened their mouths. The Finns often look very 
different from, for example, the Swedes, although they can be as blonde, even blonder than 
the Scandinavians of northern European, Germanic, Indo-European origin. 

For somebody looking at the Scandinavians from the outside, it is, however, probably 
easier to see how they are alike. For us, it is more interesting to contemplate how we are 



11 



different. We come from very different situations in terms of modern history. In the 
middle of the nineteenth century, the Danes, a rich and rather well established and even, in 
part, rather bourgeois nation was trying to sort out its complicated relations with the 
Germans, their southern neighbors, who for a long time had had a strong economic and 
cultural influence. Norway, which had been a poor part of Denmark, was now a kingdom, 
but sharing its king with Sweden. It started to develop its national characteristics and very 
quickly produced a magnificent literature with Ibsen, Biornsson and later, at the end of the 
century, Hamsun, and great painters like Krohg and Munch. Iceland was one of the 
poorest parts of Europe, economically and even culturally plundered by the Danes and 
Norwegians. Sweden was slowly emerging from a long series of military and political 
catastrophies in the nineteenth century. It was a rather poor country at this time, culturally 
more influenced by France and England than by Germany. It had not developed a 
bourgeois culture of the central European type and never would. Finland, a part of Sweden 
for at least a thousand years, had been lost to Russia in the Napoleonic wars. Finland had a 
very special and somewhat privileged role amongst the Russian provinces. The Finns 
would be important in the background of the extraordinary explosion of cultural vitality 
that took place in St. Petersburg at the turn of the century. 

In the beginning of this century, a number of changes occurred that led to the establish- 
ment of the present national situation. Norway separated itself from Sweden and became 
an independent kingdom. Finland, as a result of the February and October revolutions in 
1917, became first a kingdom and then a republic, after a civil war that would mark its 
future for a long time. Only Iceland remained a dependent part of Denmark, and became a 
republic at the end of the Second World War. Denmark, Norway and Sweden remained 
neutral in the First World War, and this contributed to the isolation that results from the 
geographical situation (it became a dead end part of Europe when the Soviets more or less 
closed their border after the end of the civil war following the October revolution). 

The time between the wars was a relatively dull period culturally speaking. The Second 
World War reserves a fate that would for a long time separate the Scandinavian countries. 
Finland was attacked by the Soviet Union in two succeeding wars of great violence. It 
managed to survive (whereas, for example, the Baltic states were absorbed by the Soviet 
Union). Finland lost one third of its territory, and 85,000 dead. Denmark and Norway 
were occupied by the Nazis and developed important resistance movements, but were 
liberated only late in the war. Iceland was occupied first by the British and from 1941 it was 
governed by the U.S., who after "negotiation" took over the role of the British. Only 
Sweden remained neutral, perhaps mainly due to its geographical situation. This lead to a 
greater isolation for Sweden that could be felt for a long time, perhaps even today, more 
than a generation after the end of the war. 

The present cultural conditions have developed from the situation between the two 
World Wars. A very quick and, of course, extremely sketchy survey of that situation gives 
the following picture: In Iceland, one artist, Johannes K)arval, 1885 — 1972, dominated the 
local scene in terms of creative action, which, generally speaking, was very quiet. The main 
writer, Halldor Laxness, had left Iceland to live in France and Italy. In Norway, a group of 
important artists, most of whom had lived in Paris for some years, came back to Oslo in the 
thirties, where they established themselves in the tradition of the artist-hero, modelling 
themselves after such examples as Munch or rather Vigeland (and the great Mexicans such 
as Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros). Their theories about society and art were slightly 
socialist or Marxist (as in Mexico) in a typical thirties way, and their aspiration was to cover 
the maximum number of walls in public buildings with their art. They dominated the 



12 



Norwegian art scene totally and managed to maintain their supremacy well into the fifties 
and early sixties. It could perhaps be said that Norwegian art is still suffering from the fact 
that one generation thus was allowed to sit at the fleshpots, more or less undisturbed, for 
such a long time. 

In Denmark the situation was totally different. The contact with Paris and the Bauhaus 
was more lively. A group of very young artists, some of whom would become very 
important after the war, had made a breakthrough and already established themselves 
before 1939, when some of them were only about twenty years old (Linien). Their idols 
were artists like Kandinsky and Klee, as well as Mondrian and the great Russians. Their 
vital avant-garde spirit survived the war years — some of these artists played a role in the 
Danish resistance movement— and immediately after 1945 they renewed their international 
contacts, and two of the most important — Robert Jacobsen and Richard Mortensen — 
moved to Paris, where they stayed for many years. Parallel to this movement that was 
resolutely oriented towards abstract art and the avant-garde, at least in its second phase, 
was the COBRA group (COBRA — Copenhagen, Srussells, /Imsterdam) whose prime 
mover was the Danish artist Asger Jorn. Jorn would also move to Paris but would spend 
long periods of his time in Denmark and Sweden. A rich and complicated 
national— international situation resulted, its richness still felt today, although a certain 
mannerism, typical for some Scandinavian cultural environments, has been creeping in. 

In Sweden, the thirties was a rather bleak period. The decade had started with an artistic 
catastrophe. For the World's Fair held in Stockholm in 1930, which became the great 
introduction to "functionalist" architecture in the Nordic countries, the Swedish artist 
Otto G. Carlsund had brought together a great exhibition of works by Mondrian, 
Vantongerloo, Leger, Helion, etc. It was received by the press and public in the most 
fearful manner. Carlsund had a breakdown, the works were dispersed, and some have not 
yet, even today, been recovered. From the beginning of the decade an artist cooperative 
called "Color and Form," representing a romantic, sometimes expressionistic naturalism of 
a rather nationalistic (or provincial) kind, also more or less totally dominated the market. 
After the immediate postwar period, some younger artists started to show rather timid 
non-figurative work based on formal ideas coming from the Bauhaus vocabulary and 
inspired by the play of positive — negative forms in the Guernica structure. It would take 
until the early sixties for Sweden to recover from the isolation it had been forced into by 
the war and the "neutrality." 

In Finland, again, the picture was different. In the thirties, a certain landscape tradition 
of quality, but difficult to understand or appreciate when seen from the outside, prevailed. 
After the wars it took, for obvious reasons, some time for Finnish culture to reestablish 
itself. As soon as the young artists could travel, many of them turned towards Italy, rather 
than to France, as is the Finnish tradition. 



The present situation in the artistic life of the Scandinavian countries 
today and something about the artists showing works in this exhibition, 
and why they were asked to participate. 

There is no overall pattern common to the situation of the pictorial arts in the five 
Scandinavian countries today. As has been said, the historical background is very diversi- 
fied, and the flood and tide in the art life does not run with the same moon. However, 
when the proposition of the present exhibition was discussed, it seemed necessary to look 



13 



upon the art produced in Scandinavia as from one country, and the works to be shown 
would have to be chosen so that the whole would give a total picture of a verv diversified 
situation. It would, at the same time, have to make a coherent and beautiful exhibition, true 
to the richness and complexity of the art life in Scandinavia. The magnitude of the 
difficulties in putting such an exhibition together can be appreciated by those who have 
tried something similar. (The effect on friendship and good relations is disastrous, it seems 
that in the end, everybody hates you, for one reason or another.) It is important to know 
that the selection (of two artists from each of the five countries) is not the result of an 
evaluation of the art in each country but is based on concern for the public's experience of 
the exhibition as a whole and on the general image this whole can give of art in Scandinavia 
today. It is obvious that the result will not satisfy anybody. 

The art in the different countries will be discussed in alphabetical order as follows: 

In the kingdom of Denmark, the present situation in the field of art is quite lively. It 
seemed that two well-established artists, now in their forties, are best suited for this 
particular exhibition: Per Kirkeby and Bjorn Norgaard. Both have already gone through a 
long series of different experiences, which seems rather typical for the younger Scandina- 
vian artists. Kirkeby started as a scientist, in geology, lived in Greenland for some time, but 
has been active mainly as an artist for a long time. His art has changed considerably during 
this period. His art has, however, remained related to his experience as a geologist, but in a 
rather secret way. Generally speaking, his paintings take a long time to reveal their content. 
They belong to a kind of expressionism (often related to Germany) that is now very much 
in fashion. Kirkeby has been doing this kind of painting for a very long time — actually, it is 
the kind of painting he did at the beginning of his career. 

Kirkeby's paintings have a background in a long tradition of lyrical-romantic landscape 
painting in Denmark, to which Emil Nolde also belonged. (Nolde was born at the 
Danish-German border.) On this occasion, it could be said that it is axiomatic that the less 
known art from peripheral countries always imitates the better known art from the center. 
It is of no importance if dates and documents presented prove the contrary. Even the 
attempt to prove the contrary is regarded as regional busybodiness or, in the best of cases, 
as touching wishful thinking. 

Bjern Norgaard's origin as an artist belongs in the Nordic-German-Fluxus-happenings 
fetishist trend of the sixties. It should be mentioned that both Kirkeby and Norgaard as 
very young artists contributed to the artistic energy that brought Joseph Beuys to 
Copenhagen and that the resulting collaboration was very close and of vital importance for 
all parties involved. Norgaard has made some very striking and beautiful happenings, his 
art is strongly related to performance and his sculptures are theatrical in the best sense of 
the word, meaning they contain important tension between formal structure and their 
compressed content. 

In Finland, art is traditionally very diversified, moving in many parallel directions. The 
artists are quite independent and may therefore be oriented towards various international 
sources, maintaining contacts with the art of The United States, France, Italy, etc. at once. 
Two somewhat but not altogether contrasting attitudes can be seen in Finland even more 
clearly than in the other countries: the fascination with the autochthonous and the craving 
to participate in the art-life of the world, to break their isolation. The two Finns in the 
exhibition clearly represent these non-conflicting alternative attitudes. Olli Lyytikainen, a 
most original artist, sometimes, it seems, reaches back into the magic world of the very 
little-known Finnish symbolist period at the beginning of the century, the years of the 
older Saarinen, Hugo Simberg, Axel Gallen-Kallela and the young Sibelius, years when the 



14 



great master Vroubel was teaching at the Academy of the neighboring St. Petersburg. 
Many of Lyytikainen's works evoke the mysteriously evasive, bittersweet and deeper 
tragic character of the Finnish landscape as reflected and imprinted in the hearts of its 
inhabitants. The inhabitants answer to the impact of their landscape in a fierce but deeply 
hidden humor. 

Paul Osipow's paintings are directly sensual; they declare the beauty of color in a most 
straightforward way. Whereas they use a reference system that is easily recognizable, their 
presence is their own and very distinct. They are far from naive, or rather they have the 
naivite of a long evolution, well-resolved and clarified into evidence. 

Leading Icelandic artists have often chosen to live in the center of Europe (at least for 
part of the time). Some have become so integrated in the art life of other cities that they are 
not always recognized as Icelandic, as is the case with the painter Erro, now living in Paris 
and Bangkok. An extremely creative group of conceptual Icelandic artists, some of whom 
are relatives, have now lived in Amsterdam for several years. Their art is certainly quite 
international in some of its aspects, but the precision, the sparseness of means of expression 
and the drastic humor of the ancestors is often present. 

Using somewhat similar means of expression (often photography) the two Icelandic 
artists are quite different in their attitudes and the content of their work is widely 
divergent. Hreinn Fridfinnsson's works are often concerned with time and the essence of 
time. It is a visual poetry; a situation is created to enhance a mystery. There is never any 
explaining, never a going back. He has said that he is "painting with nature." 

Gudmundsson uses the photo image as a vehicle for a giddy departure into a land of 
weightless, timeless and hilarious adventures where the humorous statement occurs only at 
the beginning of the trip. The visual beauty of the photo is, so to speak, the ticket. 
Gudmundsson has said: "I work with an idea like a sculptor with stone." 

As has been mentioned, Norway was dominated by the art of the thirties well into the 
fifties, remaining in, even boasting about, an independent national situation, uninfluenced 
by "international," "cosmopolitical" art. In recent years, some younger artists have freed 
themselves from the combined domination of older generations and tyrannical corporatis- 
tic artists' unions (which are strongly present in all the Scandinavian countries). A new 
situation is developing, as in many other fields of contemporary culture. (Norwegian 
popular music is at its peak and contributing strongly to the international scene.) The two 
Norwegian artists in the exhibition represent widely different aspects of the present 
Scandinavian situation. Breivik's sculpture combines elements from the tradition of con- 
ceptual form, such as, for example, Brancusi's highly simplified heads, elements from folk 
art, perfection in utilitarian objects, and even the mysterious perversion of the handmade 
object that looks like a machine element. Breivik's sculptures often appear in series where 
the different sculptures develop and support each other in an almost cinematographic 
behavior, and in that way achieve a theatrical dimension. 

Pettersen pursues in his painting the Norwegian fascination with the heritage of Munch 
and Krohg and the painters of the thirties, but he does it in a overheated, love-hate 
atmosphere where he only sometimes manages to get some distance and put his tongue in 
his cheek. He is attacking what he calls "the Norwegian variation of French late Impres- 
sionism" with an emotional engagement and an intellectual frenzy that contains a lot of 
irony. His version of "the return to painting" of the last years is proceeding on a tangential 
course and he is sailing in hard wind. 

Swedish art life today is slowly getting out of the stalemate and the desert of the 
iconoclastic discussions, and the puritanism that appeared in the aftermath of 1968, when 



15 



cheap moralism and political activism for some time poisoned the country. The critical 
considerations of the early sixties had turned into a boy-scoutish tutelage for "the masses," 
if not into crutches for fools. The present situation is quite rich and diversified. The two 
Swedish artists in this exhibition — Lars Englund and Olle Kaks — have been present and 
showing their works for a long time. Englund has for many years been dealing with a 
purified space description and interpretation starting with artificial form, but has in the last 
decade come closer to nature's ways of building. This inspiration comes in part also from 
science, in, for example, his "mapping" of topological properties. He also runs parallell 
research in architecture and sound. 

Olle Kaks showed early work at an important exhibition at the beginning of the 
evolution of conceptual art Op losse schroven at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 
1969. In the same way as some of the Finnish artists, he is now very close to an 
interpretation of nature in a new and personal kind of mood, not clearly representational 
but rather conceptual and highly sub|ective, related to the northern Swedish folk culture 
and landscape from which he comes. He has always been aware of the limiting tyranny of 
style and been able to stay free to apply his extensive knowledge of art history, paraphras- 
ing, joking, borrowing, fooling around .... 

Scandinavia: a kind of northern Balkan; little-known, neglected, misunderstood, often 
simplified in modern journalistic presentations into the silly, suffering since 1918 from its 
dead-end geographical situation that has come as a result of the Soviet Union's reluctance 
to open its borders or rather, its will for isolation. A wonderful part of the world; rich, 
modest, mysterious, difficult, partly untouched by modern international culture, still 
maintaining its own cultures, thousands of years old. Full of lakes, forests, lonely islands all 
of polished granite, winds, silence, darkness of the winters, the white nights of the 
summers, far between the farms, unpretentious, timid. A demonstration of the possible.

The Danish government recently said no to Nordsat, a Nordic TV satellite. The project 
was supposed to strengthen cultural unity in the Nordic countries — or Scandinavia, as they 
are collectively best known in English — by promoting interest in and knowledge of one 
another's countries, and by making it easier to understand one another's languages. This is 
only one of many examples of how difficult it is to make cultural cooperation work in 
Scandinavia. There are things we can agree on, but at least as many which we cannot reduce 
to their Scandinavian common denominators. 

Cultural cooperation, which is extensive, as we shouldn't forget, has naturally emerged 
from the recognition that the Nordic countries together take up a corner of Europe which 
shares certain special conditions, a common cultural heritage. 

But it can be difficult to see a common heritage. Differences among the countries are 
marked. It stands to reason that Finland occupies a cultural and geographical position 
which makes a national cultural identity necessary. And it is equally obvious that Denmark 
has become somewhat estranged from the rest of Scandinavia as far as special interests and 
potentials go, since it joined the European Communities in 1972. 

Denmark's Minister of Cultural Affairs recently noted that because of this, and due to its 
geographical position, Denmark must be seen as "a border area between Scandinavia and 
the rest of Europe." Denmark is thus a cultural buffer state which has opened its borders to 
Common Market culture, but at the same time must defend its Danish cultural identity in 
as much as it is also part of the Scandinavian entity. 

But what is a national cultural identity today, when the western world is on its way 
toward a "monoculture," with an increasingly small difference between center and 
periphery, among other things because of what one writer calls "the collapse of the time 
dimension" when it comes to the mediation of trends and ideas? 1 Outside observers raise 
this question again and again. It was a reasonable point of departure for J. Boulton Smith, 
when he attempted to isolate the special features of modern Finnish painting in what is now 
unfortunately an outdated introduction to the subject. ". . . To what extent has modern 
Finnish painting an individual cultural identity? Have the best artists in this study owed 
much to a particularly Finnish artistic tradition, or have they simply been painters of 
exceptional individual talent who happened to be born in Finland?"" J. Boulton Smith opts 
for a strong Finnish character. 

The question he poses is the same one that comes up every time a small cultural area is 
seen from a larger one. We can go to a completely different latitude and once again find the 
problem in South America, where the Colombian critic Marta Traba, for example, has 
taken this view: "I do not believe in 'Colombian art' but in' an art which comes from 
Colombia. The difference between the two is quite obvious. If we say 'Colombian art,' we 
are implying the common denominator of a group of works and admitting that they are 
linked with one another by special esthetic characteristics, by 'Colombian' characteristics. 
Yet we know quite well that such characteristics do not exist, nor can they be enunciated in 
any way." 3

The ten artists in this exhibition do not give us examples of Scandinavian art, but of 
different forms of art which have manifested themselves in Scandinavia in recent years. Is 
this how it really is? There is, after all, also art which in different ways is conditioned by 
certain basic national circumstances. So we can say that Olli Lyytikainen's work has roots 
in the fantastic Finnish narrative tradition, or that Bard Breivik's feeling for materials has a 
similar background in the admirable Norwegian handicraft tradition. At the same time, 
these elements have long since entered into a symbiotic relationship with certain features in 
the development of modernism. 

Tradition does play a role, and it should. But for avant-garde art, it is considered 
throughout Scandinavia as very dominating and onerous. It is grappling with tradition in 
an attempt to transcend it which creates the true "tension zone" in this art from 
Scandinavia— or Scandinavian art! The Norwegian painter Christian Krohg (1852-1925) 
supposedly said: "All national art is bad, all good art is national." It is interesting that the 
view was also voiced by the Danish painter Harald Giersing (1881 — 1927), who expressed it 
this way: "All good art is national, not all national art is good." The quotation is just as 
famous in Danish art history as it is in Norwegian, and Giersing's version was one to which 
Asger Jorn (1914—1973), characteristically enough, often returned. 

For many years, Jorn worked on an enormous documentation, in 28 volumes, of 10,000 
Years of Scandinavian Folk Art (only one preliminary volume of which was finished). 
There was "a Scandinavian vision of art" which the international artist Jorn wholeheartedly 
acknowledged. And he believed (in the middle of the 1960s) that a new age was about to 
begin, when "a dawning understanding will prevail that our place in world culture is not 
identical with what we accept from abroad, but with what we ourselves are able to 
produce, whether this is large or small, a recognition that we intellectually possess only 
what we give away." 4 

Tradition plays a role, and not just up to Jorn, but even farther. Both of the Danish 
participants in this exhibition, Per Kirkeby and B|orn Norgaard, have numerous references 
in Danish art history, and both, at some time or other, have passed the Danish neoclassic 
sculptor Thorvaldsen. 

The role played by tradition for young Scandinavian artists today (and along with it, the 
traditional attitude in the milieu toward which they must take a stand) is perhaps best 
summarized in statements made by two other participants in the exhibition. Paul Osipow: 
"I believe it is better to experience opposition than it is to meet with indifference." And 
Arvid Pettersen: "Tradition has haunted Norwegian art. It has remained more of a 
straightjacket than a source on which to draw. It has come to mean constraint, but it is 
your duty to derive the most from it and bring something else back to it instead. In other 
words, it is a question of a process which revitalizes tradition."

scription of the outline and

Scandinavian Folk Art," n.d. 



The official picture 

What links the Scandinavian countries together from another aspect is a largely common 
concept of cultural policy. There is an extended view of culture: as many people as possible 
should have access to art, and artists should be supported as well as possible under given 
(economic) conditions. Gradually, the artist's role has been afforded increasing respect and 
understanding, and this can be seen in the extent of the state subsidy systems which aim at 
giving artists orderly and secure conditions under which to do their creative work. The 
Norwegian national budget for 1982 on a whole follows the zero growth principle, but 
nonetheless includes a twenty percent increase over the previous year for the cultural 



sector. The higher priority placed on culture is not as clear in the other countries, but good 
will is there. The problem is that good will is often ineffective. And good will simply 
doesn't extend as far as experimental art. 

A leading Finnish civil servant recently told me that artists' social standing is higher than 
their income: people value their artists. But in spite of a major effort on the part of 
politicians, subsidy systems have not been able to keep up with inflation and the general 
rise in expenditures. Creative artists, above all, have become pauperized as a result. This 
has been realized in all of Scandinavia, and it underlies all efforts to create reasonable 
economic conditions for artists. Artists represent a low-wage occupation, a state of affairs 
not at all in keeping with their importance for national culture. 

It is difficult to understand cultural life in Scandinavia without some insight into the 
relationship between artist and society in this respect. For an American observer, a number 
of features of the established subsidy systems must seem almost exotic (if we can use the 
word "exotic" in this connection!). But it must be stressed that we have different, and 
stricter, tax regulations. Scandinavia does not have the same firm foundation of interested 
collectors, and there are none of the same enticing tax deductions, which make the collector 
an important intermediate link between artists and museums. 

The Act on the Danish State Art Foundation states by way of introduction that it has "as 
its global work to promote Danish creative art." Promoting creative art is also the primary 
goal in the other countries. At present, Norway and Sweden have worked toward it most 
consistently. The very extensive results we see there must be credited in no small measure 
to the effective trade unions, the artists' organizations. 

Denmark is the only one of the five countries which has a separate ministry of cultural 
affairs, founded in 1961. Subordinate to it is the Danish State Art Foundation, whose 
various committees (which sit for three years at a time) award three-year grants especially 
to talented young artists, and once-only grants which can be considered production and 
project subsidies. The Foundation also purchases works of art for public institutions and 
museums, pays for art works for state buildings, and provides important subsidies for 
municipal and other public buildings. Finally, there are lifelong payments, testimonial 
gifts, to a number of creative artists who have made a significant contribution in their field. 

Variations on this model form the basis for the policies of the other countries. Cultural 
subsidies in Finland are given by the National Art Council, whose members are also 
appointed for three years at a time. Artists' grants, for one, three and five years at a time, 
and project grants are taken from funds partly budgeted by the state, partly from the 
proceeds of the Finnish Slot Machine Association. The grants are tax-free. If artists' salaries 
had been adopted, they would have been taxed as normal income. There are also a number 
of artists' pensions. 

The state also finances art schools and colleges, gives extensive support to museums, 
though on the regional level there is a system of joint state and municipal support. 

A "provincial artist" experiment was carried out during the 1970s. Artists from various 
fields worked in the different provinces partly with their own creative work, partly with 
teaching and cultural work in a broader sense. The experiment has been important in 
decentralizing culture, which now plays a growing role on the local level. The results of the 
experiment were so favorable that a law was passed on the program in 1981. 

The question of an artist's salary along the same lines as those paid in Norway and 
Sweden has been discussed in Finland. Proposals have been made, but the time is not yet 
ripe for such a system. However, several f if teeny ear grants with the right to a pension have 
recently been awarded for the first time.

There is a comprehensive de- 
scription in German of the 
development of art policies 
and subsidy systems from a 
slightly different angle in J. 
Brockmann, "Zur sozialen 
Lage der bildende Kunstler 
in Norwegen," Heute Nor- 
wegen Heute, exhibition 
catalogue (Kiel and Darm- 
stadt, 1981). 



The criterion of security is an important one — above all increased social security for 
artists — and the proposals which have been made primarily concern creative artists, and, to 
a lesser extent, performing artists who hold some kind of position in theaters, orchestras, 
etc. 

In Iceland, testimonial salaries are paid to a small number of artists. They are granted for 
one year at a time, but can in practice be considered permanent. In addition, there are two 
types of work grant. The smaller grant corresponds to perhaps two to three months' salary. 
The Federation of Icelandic Artists wants to reduce the number of such grants and at the 
same time increase the payments made. The other type is grants given for three to nine 
months. 

Everyone agrees that a study should be made of grant and subsidy systems in force in the 
other countries, and there was an almost historic situation last year when all artists' 
associations in Iceland met for the first time to devise a common cultural policv. 

It should also be mentioned that Iceland has a two percent rule for works of art for 
school buildings. Under this rule, two percent of the cost of the building should be spent 
on works of art for it. It has been proposed that the same rule be applied to all state 
buildings. 

The most thoroughgoing analyses of artists' conditions, and of the state's responsibility 
toward artists as a profession, have been undertaken in Norway and Sweden. In many 
respects, Norway has gone farther than other countries in Scandinavia in meeting artists' 
demands, and the radical solutions to the problem which have been adopted can be linked 
with the recognition that until the seventies, Norway was far behind the other countries in 
cultural policy. 5 

The central points in the Norwegian subsidy system are: 

1) a system of guaranteed incomes 

2) the right for artists to negotiate 

3) the development of (collective) compensation systems. 

Let me quickly describe what these points entail since in many respects they represent a 
new way of thinking about the relationship between state and artist. 

1) A system of guaranteed incomes has been in force since 1977, and covers active artists 
who have done high-quality work. The guaranteed income is divided into segments. The 
maximum sum can be paid only to those who do not have any income of their own. 
Applications are approved by a grants committee. 

This can be difficult enough. Norway has something like 4,000 creative and performing 
artists with a position which qualifies them to subsidies under this system. Pictorial artists 
make up the largest group by far, one-quarter of the total. It should be pointed out that 
artists who want a guaranteed income do not have to be members of any organization. 

In 1981 nearly 250 pictorial artists had a guaranteed income. This year the average 
payment made to this group under the system was just under 40,000 Norwegian crowns, 
slightly over $5000. 

2) The Norwegians recognized very soon that artists had a natural right to negotiate 
their economic conditions. The state took upon itself the role of the opposite party, and at 
the same time gave negotiating rights to the national organizations which represent the 
groups of artists involved. This right covers negotiations on compensation for the use of 
artists' work, on rules and guidelines for state grants systems and guaranteed incomes, on 
remuneration for commissions, etc. 

The agreements which have been made are uniquely Norwegian and have not yet been 
implemented in the other countries. 



20 



3) The rationale of the compensation systems is the agreement that artists have the right 
to remuneration for the use of their works by the state as long as it is still the artists' 
property. Compensation is naturally made for all exhibitions which are organized or 
financed by the state. Compensation goes direct to the artist and is calculated according to 
fixed rates which are subject to price-index adjustment. 

Another point still under discussion is what literally translates as "display compensa- 
tion." This was formulated by pictorial artists who point out, among other things, that 
other creative artists, such as composers and authors, are paid royalties for the use of their 
works. Only very few pictorial artists can live from the sale of their works. This is why 
they want compensation — in addition to the kinds already mentioned — for the use of their 
work after it is sold. 

But the question is problematic and has not yet been resolved. As it is, exhibition 
budgets are already strained. All of the institutions and authorities involved have had their 
budgets raised, and expenditures for exhibition compensation will henceforth be part of the 
normal expenses in an exhibition budget. 

Since compensation is in addition calculated in proportion to the value of the work, 
prestigious exhibitions with prestigious artists could be an expensive business. Having 
work exhibited at the Venice Biennale can give a Norwegian artist an easy extra income, 
without him having to lift a finger. But a colleague in Iceland, who cannot enjoy the same 
favorable system, can risk having to pay something out of his own pocket. 

The interesting thing about the Norwegian compensation systems is that they are 
collective and have a clear social and solidary intent. In the organizations' first negotiations 
with the state, their goal was to have all artists paid equally large subsidies. This solidary 
view has been relinquished now, and today the criterion of quality has been taken up again 
in evaluations. But it is also the individual artist's work and contribution which are the 
prerequisites for membership in the organizations. 

One special feature of the situation in Norway is the artists' own important role in the 
mediation of art works. Through their own organization and exhibition institutions, they 
have contributed to the cultural decentralization which is important in a country with such 
difficult geographic conditions as Norway's. Artists, together with other art experts, also 
make up the majority in juries judging competitions for works of art for public buildings, 
etc. Those who are going to use the buildings are also on the jury, but they can never 
constitute a majority. 

The state has declared its intention to use two percent of the budget of state buildings for 
buying works of art, but the figure has hardly been more than one percent in practice 
because of general economic difficulties. 

The main trend is clear now, but new ideas have been put forward since Norway's 
change of government. The new conservative government might change the current 
situation somewhat, since the party has always taken a special stand in the debate over the 
state's responsibility toward artists. It has been against the guaranteed income system and 
preferred testimonial grants paid according to artistic criteria. The conservatives have 
criticized the guaranteed income systems for being socially oriented, without any regard 
for artistic quality. 

There is probably the general view in the other Scandinavian countries that Norway has 
a strong arts policy, but that the quality of the work done there in the pictorial arts is rather 
poor. 

In Sweden, there is an even stronger realization (of what must also be a problem in 
Norway) that there are a great many (too many?) artists. The official figure is 5000 — 6000 



21 



pictorial artists as opposed to some 1000 writers, for example. Around 3000 of them are 
members of the KRO, the Swedish Artists' National Organization. The figure naturally 
indicates that enormous amounts would have to be set aside in the budget if Swedish artists 
were to have guarantee systems and compensation similar to those of their Norwegian 
colleagues. 

At present, there are still grants for one, two and five years in addition to about a 
hundred artists' grants (with pictorial artists accounting for two-thirds of them) in the form 
of a yearly remuneration from the state calculated according to the artist's own income. 

But since the middle of the 1970s, considerable progress has been made in two areas 
which are perhaps the artists' most important demands of the state: 

1) Exhibition compensation. As in Norway, compensation is given for works of art in 
exhibitions which are under the auspices of the state or receive state aid. But this has 
already become a problem, since museums have not received compensation in the form of 
increased exhibition budgets and can thus be forced to take the necessary amounts from 
their acquisitions accounts, for example. 

There has been a discussion of whether this should hold good for all public exhibitions, 
so that the state paid part, while the municipalities covered the preliminary expenses. This 
system has never been adopted, and even though the Artists' Organization is still negoti- 
ating with the municipalities, the state has shelved the idea. 

2) "Display compensation." The basic view is the same held in Norway that pictorial 
artists have the right to compensation for the public use (i.e. being on display and seen) of 
their works. Artists want to get away from what they consider public welfare — grants, 
etc. — and instead want remuneration for work they have done. 

It has been proposed that a new Pictorial Artists' Fund be established, to which both 
"display compensation" and existing grants be transferred. A tax on audio tapes and video 
cassettes is also being levied in Sweden, which is expected to bring in 40 — 50 million 
Swedish crowns (c. $8 million) annually. Five million crowns (c. $834,000) of this would be 
transferred to the Pictorial Artists' Fund, which, with additional money from the State, 
would have 17—19 million crowns (c. $3 million) at its disposal. A heated debate is now in 
progress over how this money would be administered. Many have proposed the Norwe- 
gian model of a guaranteed income. 

State subsidies for works of art for state buildings vary from year to year. At present, the 
available funds amount to somewhat over 13 million Swedish crowns ($2.2 million) per 
year. Subsidies are not paid as a fixed percentage, but as a lump sum. The subsidies are 
granted on a case-by-case basis, according to the building's function, location, etc. The 
individual municipalities are free to decide how much they want to spend on works of art. 

Financing for works of art for state buildings is channelled through the Swedish 
National Arts Council. The Council is made up entirely of artists who sit for a period of 
three years. They administer the funds and select project leaders for the various buildings. 

There is a joint council which sees to it that those who will use the buildings are given the 
necessary information on the projects. The council debates the often minutely formulated 
demands made of the artist by the party commissioning the work of art. It thus carries out 
important informative work, which in most cases has resulted in a fine exchange of 
viewpoints on art's function in its specific surroundings. This joint council has, in fact, 
given the lie to fears of indirect censorship. Sweden has a public participation law which 
has not, however, had any direct significance for pictorial art in public buildings. There 
have been a few examples in Sweden and Norway of the public opposing the works of art 
they have been given, and there is little doubt that if the democratization of the decision- 



22 



making processes regarding art in public places is carried much further, there will be a risk 
of tame and insignificant art, a kind of visual Muzak which pretties up public milieux and 
doesn't offend anyone. As it is, one can point out many important and interesting results, 
among them several of the decorations in Stockholm's subway stations, which are often 
cited in showing how well this system works. 

It is tempting to make comparisons with conditions in America, where the Art in 
Architecture program of the seventies, at least to a Scandinavian observer, seems to have 
worked more openly and with less bias with a view to new art. But there is hardly any 
parallel in Scandinavia to the belief expressed by the program's administrator, Jay Solo- 
mon, that the government has a responsibility "to experiment, to innovate, to be a testing 
ground for new ideas." 6 Opposed to this belief is that strange public participation law, a 
grand example of misunderstood democracy, where every view will be considered, result- 
ing in art based on compromises and cold calculation. 

There are other problems. They are Sweden's problems, but also indirectly involve the 
other countries: it is impossible in the eighties to live up to the cultural programs which the 
state and its bureaucrats established in the seventies. The economic crisis means dis- 
appointed prospects for artists' organizations. The National Council for Cultural Affairs, 
which in Sweden is the single authority for nearly the whole cultural field, admits that the 
least progress has been made in the pictorial arts. Proposals such as "display compensa- 
tion" came into the picture so late as far as the Council was concerned that funds had 
already been earmarked or used. Pictorial artists on the whole undoubtedly are more 
estranged from politicians than other groups of artists. And unlike writers, they do not 
have a tradition of formulating their cultural policies. 

One can say in summary that cultural policy is built upon highly diffuse artistic criteria. 
It is, above all, social policy, with social security as its underlying rationale. Artists want 
the same social and economic security as the rest of society. The danger is that organiza- 
tional politics will overshadow other considerations. Has increased social security helped 
bring artists and the rest of society closer together? "Display compensation" and other 
forms of support have, it is true, raised the artists' income, but hardly society's understand- 
ing of how the enormous work which comes out of all this should actually be used. As a 
leading Swedish civil servant recently remarked to me, artists should rethink their role in 
society as a whole, and not concentrate only on their economic security.

Somewhere between opposition and indifference — the unofficial picture 

Improved economic conditions for artists must naturally be seen as an unmixed blessing. 
But the various subsidy systems have also meant an administration and a structuring which 
make many young Scandinavian artists feel that their milieu has become too bureaucratic. 
Second-rate artists are enthusiastic about joining organizations, and become "apparat- 
chiks," while artists who have long since made a success of it stay away because they can 
manage very well on their own. Young artists just making a breakthrough or looking for 
alternative forms of expression are not given enough backing by any party, and become 
odd men out. 

But good finances are not enough to make a good artistic environment. And neither are 
strong trade unions. Many different factors interact at a specific time and release energy 
and activity. It is worth noting that now, in the beginning of the eighties, we are finding an 
optimism and an expectation of interesting lines of development in Scandinavia in the 
upcoming years. The level of information is much higher. Good young artists see their 



23 



work as part of larger developments which are not decided by national borders alone. 
Important interaction is taking place within this specific Scandinavian field. But artists 
work in an area where conservatism, opposition and indifference help decide the 
framework and condition results. 

Exhibitions can be seen as a direct indicator. It stands to reason that much that has 
happened in Denmark, for example, has been obstructed by traditional features in the 
exhibition system. Tradition has been cemented because of the particular, almost unique, 
Danish phenomenon: artists' groups and their annual exhibitions. Though these groups 
were originally founded by artists who had a kinship or common esthetic, they have come 
to carry on traditional standards unchallenged. Renewal in the form of new members or 
guests almost always occurs within the given framework. The groups' exhibitions are the 
most important events in the Danish art world. The joint platform gives the artists 
themselves greater attention than they would have received if they had exhibited their 
works in one-man shows. 

The groups have primarily aimed at attracting a bourgeois public of art lovers and 
express an inertia in the milieu which has also delayed an understanding of new trends. 
This is actually surprising, since Danish art in the sixties and seventies was fairly rich in 
opposition groups interested in current ideas and views. 

There are at least two reasons why avant-garde artists' activities at this time were not 
more effective. First of all, a significant part of these activities took the form of happenings 
and performances, which had a limited public and which were not sufficiently- 
documented. Secondly, the abstract movement in the late thirties and forties and the 
founding of the COBRA group constituted such a breakthrough that thev have dominated 
Danish art ever since. When we in Denmark speak of "modern art," it is still synonymous 
with the work of these artists, even though they are all around seventy years of age. 

It is this generation on which the public has concentrated its interest. It is they who have 
been written about most. Their works have been safe investments for the liberal 
bourgeoisie which wants to collect modern art without daring to go right out to the front. 

These are factors which, as I mentioned, to a certain extent overshadow what at times 
was the highly vigorous and energetic milieu in Copenhagen during the past two decades. 
There are active links with German art, in particular, in the wake of the COBRA 
movement. The links can be traced to the SPUR group in West Germany, to the interna- 
tional situationist movement and to Fluxus. And, as is the case in the other Scandinavian 
countries, there are a couple of small galleries which serve as catalysts. 

German-born Arthur Kopcke (1928— 1977) 7 had a little gallerv in Copenhagen from the 

beginning of the fifties which he ran as a sideline to his own important artistic work. 

Through it, he channeled such trends as le Nouveau Realisme and Fluxus into the Danish 

art world, and it was Kopcke who introduced Denmark to Piero Manzoni. (This had the 

unusual result that Manzoni, with the intervention of a liberal patron in the summer of 

1960, was able to work in Herning, in Jutland, and there carried out his longest line— 7200 

meters — which, sealed in a zinc box, still stands as one of the town's monuments!) The 

Fluxus group became known in the early sixties, and George Maciunas, Emmett Williams, 

Dick Higgins, Alison Knowles and Ben Patterson were active in Copenhagen in 1962, the 

year in which the group also worked in Germany and London. The year after, John Cage 

and David Tudor took part in a Fluxus festival. 

But it is contacts with Germanv which have left lasting traces. The meeting between

together with Beuys and wrote music for "Eurasienstab/fluxorum organum" and other 
pieces. Beuys performed part of his "Sibirische Symphonie" — "Eurasia" — in Copenhagen 
in 1966. The same year, Christiansen and Norgaard participated together with Beuys in a 
performance of "Manresa" at the Galene Schmela in Dusseldorf. b 

The Experimental Art School— an alternative school opposed to the teaching at the 
Royal Academy of Fine Arts — was very important for developments in the sixties. It 
emphasized the experimental situation and collective forms of work, and for some years set 
the framework for a highly intense milieu. 

This is not the place to document the postwar art history of Denmark. The examples I 
have given can suffice to show the fruitful and positive side of being "a border area between 
Scandinavia and the rest of Europe." This is bound up with the geographic proximity to 
the Continent and the fairly open atmosphere in Copenhagen. Young Danish artists today 
are keeping their connections with Germany. Many of them exhibit their works there, 
while others work there themselves. It is not surprising that German "neo-expressionism" 
has made a rapid breakthrough in Danish art as well. 

The level of activity is different, and has a different character now than it did in the 
sixties. Artistically, we find a pluralism and an open situation which can be fruitful in the 
long run. Young artists have a great need for work grants and other subsidies from the 
Danish State Art Foundation. 

However, the number of grants is being cut, and the minimum amount raised, because of 
the current recession and inflation. Pictorial artists are calling in vain for an effective 
organization which can negotiate directly with the state. Last year, a Danish sculptor tried 
to bring attention to the problem of lack of support for art when he blew up one of his 
granite sculptures. Judging from the reaction, it was a futile act. 

Fairly few galleries exhibit completely new art and systematically follow new trends. 
Some official and semiofficial institutions purchase in a terribly traditional vein, and do not 
give any real support to experimental art. Company art societies are regular buyers at the 
large exhibitions in Denmark, as in the rest of Scandinavia, but they also keep to well- 
known artists and help maintain the status quo. 

There has been a fairly intense debate in Denmark during the past couple of years about 
the founding of a museum of modern art in Copenhagen. But not even the most modest 
proposals can be carried out during the present recession, and nobody has thought about 
how an even tolerable collection could be amassed and expanded further with the prevail- 
ing international price level. 

But Denmark already has the Louisiana Museum outside Copenhagen. Its collection has 
become quite significant over the years and its highly active exhibition policies have 
provided running information on international developments from the sixties onwards. 
Many of these exhibitions have had an important effect on the Danish art world. 

The large museums in Scandinavia rarely assume the role of a window on the current 
world. They are traditional institutions and must thus retain a historical perspective. The 
Henie-Onstad Art Center outside Oslo is the Norwegian parallel to Louisiana as far as its 
facilities and location go, but has probably never had the same significance for art life in 
Norway. The most interesting in this connection is Stockholm's Moderna Museet, which 
directly brought about a very high level of activity in Swedish art in the sixties. American

There is an up-to-date intro- 
duction to modern Swedish 
art: Olle Granath, Another 
Light. Swedish Art Since 
1945 (published by the Swe- 
dish Institute, n.d.). New, 
revised edition, 1982. 



Sweden is largely similar to Denmark in its openness to new trends in art. Seen from 
neighboring countries, Swedish art has held a clear avant-garde position. Swedish artists 
have set themselves into the international context more rapidly than artists in the rest of 
Scandinavia. 9 There is also a personal link to American art through Claes Oldenburg and 
Oyvind Fahlstrom, and this is incidentally a link which Swedish art is trying to maintain. 
Sweden is the only country in Scandinavia (but Denmark might be able to join it) to have a 
studio at P.S. 1 in New York and an annual grant to cover a stay there. 

One can also see parts of this development as "trendy." Some people feel that new trends 
are being accepted too quickly — in a hunt for something new — only to be left again if they 
can't make it locally or be developed individually. There are clear signs of eclecticism 
throughout the sixties and seventies in Swedish art, but on the personal level, there is an 
attitude of relativism which lets the individual more or less change expression and views 
unhindered. 

Geographic problems play a role in Sweden, as they do in Norway. Stockholm holds an 
obviously dominant place, especially now, with the marked increase in the number of 
galleries there (around a hundred in the Stockholm area alone). But regional centers such as 
Gothenburg and Malmo, whose proximity to Copenhagen is not an insignificant factor, 
partly counterbalance Stockholm. 

The provincial museums do a great deal on their own initiative for young art. Organiza- 
tional politics have, however, to a certain extent backfired on the artists themselves. The 
"display compensation" I mentioned before also eats into exhibition budgets. 

One can sense a vital and almost anarchistic situation in young artists' circles. They are 
experimenting in many directions, and here, too, the currently highly saleable German 
neo-expressionism has made a major impact. The German artist Jorg Immendorff was a 
guest teacher at the College of Art in 1981, and this can be seen as a sign of the direction 
interests are taking today. It is indisputable that he has already left his mark in Sweden. 

The problem for young artists is, says one of the teachers at the school, that they go into 
an experimental situation with a suspended awareness of history. They have not brought 
their historical materiel out to the front, and thus lack certain necessary premises for the 
work they are doing. Considering how the rest of Scandinavia earlier viewed the situation 
in Sweden, it is interesting to note that young artists are more interested now in what is 
happening in neighboring countries, and that they are watching developments in Norway, 
for example, with great attention. 

A young Finnish artist who has been working in avant-garde art for several years speaks 
of what he calls "a policy of exhaustion." How is it possible, he wonders, that in Finland 
one can reach a certain level, receive support and favor to a certain point, and then no 
further. You can develop yourself and reach an acceptable level in your own development. 
But there is never anyone who is standing ready to catapult you further, out into a larger 
context. 

It is regrettable if this is one of the consequences of the democratization of art life. 
Nonetheless, this is exactly what many artists and museum people are thinking about. All 
expect to get their slice of the cake — in other words of the subsidy systems — and everything 
is leveled out: the milieu becomes horizontal. It is no less important that Finnish isolation, 
the unwillingness to open up to international culture, is considered a modern dilemma by 
many young artists. 

Cultural isolation is part of the Finnish experience. Finland's location, far from the 
mainstream, contributes to what many Finns openly call a national inferiority complex. 
History shows that the Finns are not outgoing, but that they defend their territory. They

are slow to react to influences from abroad, but on the other hand safeguard their deep 
roots in the Finnish intellectual tradition. We wait a long time before we react, says one 
Finnish artist. And this is also true of modern art. The major trends come late and in highly- 
modified form to Finland, but are well received. The Finns are, he says, not good at con- 
fronting artistic problems directly. Everything is taken indirectly, if not exactly hostilely. 

The Art Museum of the Ateneum in Helsinki held three major informative exhibitions 
several years ago, aimed at orienting the Finns towards tendencies in new international art. 
These Ars 61, 69 and 74 all met with scepticism and opposition, but there should in fact be 
more such initiatives. They are just so difficult to realize. There are cultural agreements 
with countries in eastern Europe, whose exhibitions programs run smoothly, but there is 
no such channel for similar exhibitions from the West. This is Finland's exhibition system 
on the official level, and it is here the distortion of information comes, showing an 
overdose of exhibitions from the East. 

The seventies was one of the most boring periods in the recent history of Finnish art. 
After 1968, we can see a polarization in society which also brought party politics into 
culture. Pictorial art was dominated in the following years by a wave of social realism. 
Pictures revelled in an old, rustic reality which was a mishmash of false show and nostalgia. 
We can see this social realism of a kind as a consequence of the political climate. Within 
pictorial art, it was alone counterbalanced by good Finnish constructivism. 

As a direct consequence of the move to the left, some artists started a little organization 
in 1968 opposed to the large and highly bureaucratic Artists' Association, which was 
considered very traditional and conservative. Later, the new organization merged with the 
old one, and helped change attitudes there. Nonetheless, very old-fashioned questions are 
still being asked regarding art and its function in society, and many young artists find it 
difficult to get support within the Artists' Association. It is more interested in getting state 
subsidies for its members than it is in art's role in society. But an artist outside the 
organization can have difficulty in obtaining the necessary grants and can easily be 
boycotted or kept out of important activities. 

Where has new art been these past years? The Ars exhibitions at the Art Museum of the 
Ateneum did have their effect— no doubt about it. The Free Art School in Helsinki has also 
opened the way for an understanding of new problematics of painting. There is now a new 
generation of artists of which much is expected, with women artists well represented. 

The Ars exhibitions gave modern art a certain urgent currency, a challenge from outside 
to the local milieu. The response came from a little group of artists which unfortunately 
never gained the place it deserved in the seventies, something which is only now being 
realized in retrospect. It was the true avant-garde which manifested itself at Cheap Thrills, 
a little gallery opened in 1971 by the artist, theoretician and writer Jan Olof Mallander and 
kept going until 1977 in spite of economic difficulties. Mallander later called it "the good 
bad conscience of Finnish art." 10 

The gallery served as a platform for a group of artists which had no other place to exhibit 
its work and which also fell outside the categories Finnish exhibitions could think of 
accepting at the time. The artists called themselves the Reapers. Olli Lyytikainen made his 
debut and had his most important early exhibitions at the gallery. There were also 
exhibitions of work by kindred artists from the rest of Scandinavia, and finally an attempt 
was made to introduce international art. Important contacts were established with other 
small but important art galleries elsewhere in Scandinavia: Gallery I in Bergen and Gallery 
SUM in Reykjavik. 

It must seem natural now that Cheap Thrills had to go under in the battle between the 



27 



dominating trends, realism and constructivism, but just as natural, against this background, 
that the gallery had emerged. Cheap Thrills represented the little tendency to alarm which 
emphasized that not everything was as good or as self-sufficient as people wanted to 
pretend. 

Many young Finnish artists feel very much like the nineteenth-century statesman who 
stressed that the Finns were neither Swedes nor Russians: thev should be themselves, 
uniquely placed as they are between East and West. A new generation of artists is about to 
break down Finland's isolation. There is a more open atmosphere and fresher air in the 
debate. 

A largely similar development can also be found in Norwegian art today. The events of 
1968 marked an epoch everywhere, in Norway no less than in Finland. And the Norwegian 
situation is perhaps also the one which is most like the Finnish: there are above all the same 
powerful ties with tradition. 

The many artist-run activities and powerful trade organizations which have helped bring 
about results in negotiations with the state are on one level an expression of a close-knit 
national art life. And self-sufficiency and the national effort are dramatically and demon- 
stratively expressed in the large decorations for the Oslo Town Hall: pictorial art used as a 
national manifestation. 

Perhaps because of powerful organizations, set patterns and relative predictability in the 
art world, established artists quickly become staid and languid, and stop taking the lead, 
notes a young Norwegian artist. And this is actually strange, since Oslo has a bohemian 
tradition which earlier gave the city a vital and significant cultural atmosphere. 

Oslo is still the important center it was. This is where established artists settle. The 
number of galleries has increased considerably in recent years, and there is a fairly active 
exhibition schedule. But because of its geography, Norway has a decentralized art world, 
where regional activities and differences are expressed, and where mediation in general is a 
key concept in cultural policy. Each year, regional exhibitions are arranged by the district 
organizations of pictorial artists in cooperation with local art societies. In the later 
seventies, six artists' centers were established in various parts of the country which run 
galleries and exhibitions and disseminate other kinds of information. All are run by artists 
themselves. 

Art education is to a certain extent decentralized, too, since the State Art Academy in 
Oslo has now been joined by the Vestlandet Art Academy (in Bergen), which became a 
state institution in 1981, and the Art School in Trondheim. It is difficult to catch sight from 
Oslo of much of what is happening in the regional centers. To get into this milieu, to make 
oneself known as a young artist at all, evidently involves joining a process which is highly 
structured. Both the Norwegian representatives in this exhibition, Bard Breivik and Arvid 
Pettersen, are examples of how it can also be done, in a true interplay with essential factors 
outside the organizations. 

Both artists come from Bergen, which has traditionally had a highly localized and very 
reactionary cultural life, without any major external influences. And contacts with Oslo 
have been traditionally distant. Many of Bergen's young artists have gone to the Royal 
Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen for their education, instead of going to Oslo. Danish 
artists served as visiting teachers in Bergen even before the school was given its present 
status. 

A group of artists joined forces in the midst of this provincial isolation in the late sixties. 
The result of their work together was a progressive interplay, a release of energy based on 
work with impulses from without and on mutual openness in the exchange and discussion 



28

rary Art," North No. 10-11

of information. At the same time, certain excellent institutes within the humanities were 
very much in evidence at the University, and a new, young generation of writers began to 
emerge in Bergen. In other words, a stimulating milieu which involved science, literature, 
art and music gave activities a new direction and energy. And none of this was burdened by 
tradition, as in Oslo. 

The Flash (Lyn) group emerged, which established Gallery I without any real economic 
basis in 1969. The group's own artists exhibited their works there, but the gallery also held 
Scandinavian exhibitions and worked in cooperation with Mallander's Cheap Thrills in 
Helsinki and the SUM group in Iceland. Close professional and social contacts were 
important, and the interplay between theory and practice was utilized in the persistent 
efforts to build up the Vestlandet Art Academy, where new teaching methods were 
adopted. The break with traditional attitudes was obvious to all when the Flash group 
made a prominent debut in Oslo with the controversial exhibition Bellevue, Bellevue in 
1972." 

Iceland lies quite apart geographically from the rest of Scandinavia. This isolation has, on 
the other hand, meant that it has been equally natural for Icelanders to seek out contacts in 
the United States and Britain and on the European continent, as it has for them to seek 
them in the rest of Scandinavia. The last few generations of Icelandic artists have battled 
heavy odds and managed to create a milieu and to gain a central place in the European art of 
the past decade. These artists have, it is true, had a better forum abroad than in Iceland. 
Young artists feel as if they are working in a vacuum back home; in any case, they do not 
meet with any real sympathy. There is a generation gap and a lack of understanding 
between them and older artists, and between them and the public. This is a strange 
indifference when we consider the level of activity and the quality of the work being done. 

In spite of difficult economic conditions, Iceland has a vital art world. Critic Adalsteinn 
Ingolfsson has registered something like 170 exhibitions annually for the past couple of 
years. But avant-garde art accounts for a modest fraction of the official picture. 

Naturally, this is an important reason why Icelandic artists have preferred to settle in 
other places. Earlier, Copenhagen was a natural destination, but some artists also went to 
France and Germany. The Gudmundsson brothers' decision to move to Amsterdam was of 
decisive importance for new Icelandic art, just as important for what is happening nowa- 
days as what the great Icelandic writer Halldor Laxness called "the Danish-Icelandic 
divan" was for the artists of the thirties and forties. In recent years, the Academy in 
Maastricht could almost be considered an Icelandic school. Something between twenty and 
twentyfive Icelandic artists have been trained there and, at the moment, the Academy still 
has a handful of Icelandic students. 

The very young generation is taking a chance and staying home. A circle of interested 
people has after all created something which is becoming a milieu. And artists can join 
together in opposition to the official milieu, which has largely let them down. 

One interesting expression of this is the Living Art Museum (Nylistasafn), which was 
started by a group of older artists from the influential SUM group together with younger 
artists in an attempt to preserve and document the central segment of new Icelandic art 
which SUM represents. 

The Living Art Museum received a large donation of work by Dieter Rot (who was in 
Iceland almost without interruption from 1957 to 1964), and works by Daniel Spoerri, 
Richard Hamilton, Joseph Beuys and other artists who had been in Iceland and worked 
together with SUM artists. 

The museum is now trying to use its modest funds to make a systematic documentation

of the art of the sixties in Iceland. Young artists can join the museum by simply giving one 
piece of work to it annually. The Living Art Museum now has good exhibition facilities 
and arranges regular showings. 

SUM emerged from a dissatisfaction with the set, conservative and worn-out art milieu. 
The artists who formed the association "had in common dissatisfaction and society's 
contempt, but not very much else," as Gudbergur Bergsson expressed it. "All SUM art is 
permeated with Icelandic eccentricity, the only characteristic and independent attitude that 
has been held in Iceland, an attitude of isolation, the individual, and the outlaw." 1 * 

These are perhaps not features of the characteristic and easily recognizable Icelandic 
version of conceptual art in the seventies. This special, minimal, laconic, but also lyrical 
Icelandic expression was accelerated by a kinship with certain Dutch conceptual artists, 
based on personal relationships and a free exchange of experiences (Sigurdur Gudmunds- 
son works in The Netherlands while Douwe Jan Bakker works in Iceland) and contacts 
which reveal a kindred mentality. 

The central force in art these past few years is Magnus Palsson. It would be difficult to 
overestimate his importance as an artist and as a teacher of the new generation. As a teacher 
at the Icelandic College of Arts and Crafts in Reykjavik in the seventies, he among other 
things arranged to invite visiting teachers — Robert Filliou, Dieter Rot, Bakker and Dick 
Higgins are names which give a certain impression of the directions in which things were 
going— even though finances only allowed a short stay for each artist. Now there are plans 
to establish a stop-over program, in which artists on their way between Europe and the 
United States can "hop off" in Iceland and give lectures. 

It was also Palsson who took the initiative in founding the Mobile Summer Workshop, a 
workshop planned on generous lines for conceptual art. It can only be hoped that the 
experiment will do better than the Experimental Environment arrangement, which was 
held outside Reykjavik in the summer of 1980. Young Scandinavian artists working with 
environmental art were supposed to meet there and carrut a number of projects. Later they 
were to implement their ideas and work in localities in the rest of Scandinavia. But without 
a solid organization and financing, the experiment partly misfired. 

Halldor Laxness, in his little book about the painter Svavar Gudnason, tells of a visit 
Alfred Barr, Jr., once made to Reykjavik. He wanted to see works by the Icelandic painter 
Jon Stefansson, who, together with other talented Scandinavians, studied with Matisse in 
the years before the First World War. Barr wanted to see how an Icelandic artist had 
reacted to such influences. He was shown "some pictures of overworked cliffs and glaciers, 
shaggy horses and seascapes with breakers as thick as oatmeal [and] hurried to look away 
without saying a word." 

"Nonetheless," continued Laxness, "it should be possible for an American to compre- 
hend the incomprehensible in the idea that Jon Stefansson or some other Scandinavian, or 
for that matter also some American, regardless how gifted, could be made into a Matisse 
no. 2 through a process of training in Paris in 1908, even under Matisse himself." 13 

The good young artists in Scandinavia do not want to be a copy of some contemporary 
master or other, either. Their field of operation lies at the crossroads between tradition and 
new creativity, and I would guess that most of them will agree with the Finnish writer Jorn 
Donner— who writes in Swedish and thinks like a European! — when he says the following 
in his searching and self-revealing diary: "I consider it an important element in all artistic 
work to try to question or define national identity, to know what nation one belongs to 
and why." 14

''The following photographs show models, on a scale of 1 :4, of the works executed for 
the exhibition. The hull shape has been my prime object of investigation for three years 
now, and the process has resulted in works that I have seen in many different contexts 
and exhibition rooms. My obsession with this shape stems from its 'archetypal' quality; 
insect, hull, container, building, vehicle. A shape that reminds us of something, some 
almost forgotten moment. These forms relate in the deepest sense to our perception of 
time. As constructions, emanating from the mind, they picture our need to shape our 
culture, and suggest ways of thinking or dreaming. They lay bare levels of abstraction in 
a specific period of time. 

The tradition of sculpture is very much concerned with mass and sohdness of shape, 
which create a monumental distance. Another tradition stems from the crafting of arti- 
facts for use. My concern, in these works, is with the field of energy between these two 
poles, to work with both the mass and the shell."

The Origin 

In the book Islenskur Adall (Icelandic Aristocracy) by the author Thorber- 
gur Thordarson, which was first published in 1938, there is a little story of 
a man called Solon Gudmundsson — an "aristocrat." He lived in a fishing 
village in the North West of Iceland where he had a small house. He was a 
very hospitable man and his house served as a private hotel for many other 
"aristocrats" who did not have a fixed address or position in society, but 
chose freedom and mobility to be more fit for the study and enjoyment of 
life. Solon Gudmundsson was a man of many talents. Early in life he 
became familiar and efficient with most jobs on the sea and on land. For 
example he was a good carpenter. He composed a very special and personal 
kind of poetry which he himself called "light jokes." He also made several 
interesting objects of no practical purpose except to help develop his and 
other people's consciousness. It is likely that he was considered mad by 
most people, but his madness was tolerated because he did not bother 
anybody, could look after himself and even help others, and because he and 
his acts were a welcome source of conversation in the village. When Solon 
Gudmundsson was already an old man, he sold his house and started build- 
ing a new one, using mostly wood and corrugated iron, a widely used 
building material in Iceland. 

The following is a shortened and freely translated extract from the book 
Islenskur Adall: 

He started building the house in the following manner: first he made a 
wooden construction in an ordinary way, then fixed corrugated iron sheets 
on the inside of the wooden frame and started living in the building at this 
stage. The building process was to continue depending on the economic 
situation and other circumstantial conditions. Solon wanted to build this 
house completely in the reverse order of traditional architecture, that is to 
say putting the corrugated iron on the inside and finishing with wallpaper 
on the outside. When Solon was asked why he planned to build the house 
in this way, he answered with a faint smile: "Wallpaper is to please the eye, 
love, so it is reasonable to have it on the outside where more people can 
enjoy it." But Solon did not get very far with his project because some very 
concerned friends managed with much difficulty to persuade him to retire 
to an old people's home. There he was well cared for until he died on the 
18th of October, 1931.

The House 



In the summer of 1974, a small house was built in the same fashion as Solon 
Gudmundsson intended to do about half a century ago, that is to say an 
inside-out house. It was completed on the 21st of July. It is situated in an 
unpopulated area of Iceland, in a place from which no other man-made 
objects can be seen. 

The existence of this house means that "outside" has shrunk to the size 
of a closed space formed by the walls and the roof of the house. The rest 
has become "inside." 

This house harbors the whole world except itself.

The quality of any art depends on the relationship 
between the artist and his work. 

A good work of art will be an imprint of his soul. 
Only by loving and admiring such works is one able 
to journey in the landscape of art. For years, I lived in 
that landscape. 

Nowadays my impulses to make art are drawn, in- 
creasingly, from another landscape, from that of the 
ebb and flow, sun and rain, day and night, love and 
grief. 

But I am, I must admit, frequently homesick for the 
beautiful experiences I enjoyed during my journey 
through the landscape of art.

The trunks 

The trunks of big trees. The nethermost stem, from the toes of the roots 
that bore themselves down into the ground, and a distance up, a distance 
completely free of branches. A frame, a pillar stump. But both are associa- 
tions that I derive from my historical interest. But what do they look like, 
the trunks. I draw them, at times with historical eyes, a consciousness of a 
history, at other times with a pretence of observation. But the observation 
also wears historical glasses. There are the molded trees, think of Baldung 
Gnen, Diirer, but already then they too flatten out. When Seghers and 
Altdorfer set about it, the moss mist seeps upward and lichen and moss 
steam down. The mood of moisture condenses the trunks flat. The feeling is 
not molded, the feeling is colors, even in black and white. The large feeling 
is not able to hold the trunks fast as round pillars. The temple pillars be- 
come stage settings against the colored sky. Turner. It is the living brush 
with color on it. The stylized version is the symbolism, the blank surface 
designated. I cannot even see that trunks are round when I set out to create 
the reality with pencil and paper. Faced with the uncertain and dangerous 
substances which are the surroundings, "the reality," it comes out strokes 
and tones. Tonalities without molded illusion. And the drawing is the 
reality. The pictorial art is the reality. Therefore it makes me sick when a 
picture does not turn out, when it shatters, literally physically sick, for 
there is no place to be, no reality. It is not there until the picture turns out, 
then there is peace for a time. Dream, that is the molded trees, those I 
cannot make into reality, but it is pictures, it is the pictures of the dream. In 
Prince Valiant, which is dream, the trees are molded, but they are carica- 
tures of the molded trees. They are so big and rugged, so marvelously 
molded that they have never stood in any painter forest. In most modern 
comic-strips the tree trunks are merely two strokes. Not the limitation of a 
symbolistic surface, but hastily jotted markings in a space of mood. The 
feeling supports the reality. All that outside, that we call trees and all else, is 
not to be trusted. But it is a substance like color in tubes, to create the 
reality we live in.

Poimandres 

At once all was unfolded to me, 
and I beheld an immensity in which 
all was light, and in that light were 
gentleness and joy, and I was aston- 
ished at what I saw. But soon a 
sort of darkness emerged, drawing 
downwards in coiling spirals, dis- 
mal and menacing, like unto a ser- 
pent. Thereafter the darkness was 
transformed into a running, wet 
nature, an indescribably whirling 
water from which vapor was emit- 
ted like the smoke from a fire: and 
from the water rose a groaning cry, 
a wild and unimaginable shriek 
that to me sounded like the voice 
of fire. At the same instant a holy 
Word was uttered from the light, 
and the Word covered the whole of 
Nature; at which a purified flame 
rose high above the wetness, up to- 
wards the place of glory. The fire 
was light, lively and eager; and the 
air, also light, followed the ignited 
gust, rising with the fire from the 
earth and water, as if suspended to 
the fire, while the earth and water 
remained where they had been, so 
mixed with each other that they 
were hard to distinguish. All this 
was set in constant motion by the 
breath of the Word, which had 
withdrawn into the heights, dis- 
tinguishable only to the ear.

How To Be a Detective When Bunny Plays Piano 



Every situation has its own language, its own 
agents of expression. I can't imagine a situation 
in which nothing is done— or I can, but I know 
it to be false. 

There is no inventor who invents a new wheel— 
the most radical are those who understand how 
the wheel works. 

If an artist does not realize that he always has 
these many-thousand-year-old eyes, two feet, 
and two hands with five fingers — then the door 
won't open. 

Olli Lyytikainen 



When Axel Gallen-Kallela, the strongman of Finnish 
Golden Age Art, was only nineteen he painted an early 
masterpiece, Boy and Crow. — A very naturalistic scene, 
showing a young lad, half turned away, looking at a 
crow picking in the right corner of the composition. 
Shortly afterwards the artist painted another equally 
poignant picture, Old Woman and Cat. The ugly hag is 
turned towards us, halfway, looking at the cat in the 
lower right corner. 

These are straightforward images, very Finnish, but 
also archaic, mirroring deep levels of the mind. The 
idiom and way of painting is the same in both but the 
psychic content is reversed. They contain the nucleus of 
the artist's vision, later to develop into a huge body of 
dramatic work, including the powerful illustrations to 
the Kalevala, Finland's national epic, a source-book for 
the Finnish mind. 

But the sparks that triggered off Gallen-Kallela's vi- 
sion are found already in these two images. The first 
image led to the other; by some psychic necessity it 
provoked its counterpart. Having painted one side of 
the human situation, the artist had to paint the other. 
Through opposing forces like these, his vision unfolds. 
He is not unique in this, of course, but seldom can the 
polarity be seen, and confronted, so stalwartly. 

Between such polarities, and many many more, Olli 
Lyytikainen works his way through a highly personal 
Odyssey. One should perhaps not compare these two at 



all, for Lyytikainen — the Peter Pan of Finnish art — is, in 
his own way, almost totally un-Finnish: eccentric and 
versatile, with a variety of expression, that makes the 
elder artist seem a bit stuck-up in his role as a national 
mythmaker. When Olli was nineteen he moved around 
in the cafes of Helsinki, dressed in an English-style 
tweed suit, exhibiting peculiar neckties and other 
emblems of an original life-style, surprising his friends 
by turning out series of extraordinary drawings, images 
that seemed to us to come from another state of mind 
altogether. Strange portraits of imagined beings with real 
names: "Friedrich Nietzsche" seen as a schoolboy, tak- 
ing a hesitant step; "Charlotte Corday" as an androgyne 
angel; "Jean Vigo" hypnotically staring into the specta- 
tor and his own mind, and many more. 

On some archetypal levels Lyytikainen seems to move 
on the same wavelength as Gallen-Kallela, but he is 
freer, more bizarre, more intense, "hot" and psychic— 
and thus maybe closer to another Nordic genius, 
Edvard Munch. The pictures are small in size but with a 
"high definition," revealing meanings beyond the drama- 
tically gestural. For some fifteen years he has been draw- 
ing forth a continuous stream of personalities — as if from 
some huge unknown Image Bank in the Lower Manhat- 
tan of the Art World's mind. Where they really come 
from, and where they are going, and what Lord they 
are serving, really, it is hard to know, but everything is 
charged with meaning, energy. 

Lyytikainen could not repeat himself, and I doubt 
whether he could make a "bad" (uninteresting) image, 
even if he tried. Debasements and regressions just give 
access to more strange images. He does not hide behind 
squares or color fields — I don't think he could make an 
abstract picture. There is all too much anxiety and ex- 
citement, polarization and paranoia, hysteria and mys- 
tery, that need to be expressed. Idealization and destruc- 
tion, awe and excitement mingle; every blessing seems to 
be connected with some cursing. The most longed for is 
intimately connected with the most feared. "Dogs bark 
in the basement while church bells ring in the tower." 
To handle all this demands unusual resources. The art- 
istry is revealed in the way he manages to bind up and 
give meaningful life to agonizing energies.

The Human Wall 

Monumentality must emerge inexorably from within — 
that is true architecture. No petty-minded judgments 
of taste, but an architecture arising from needs and 
dreams, a form filled not by the academic grind but by 
genuine passion. 

The Human Wall is all conceivable walls at once, its 
various figures are sculptures, pictures and people we 
meet and see. (The human figure in the history of art, 
man's interest in man throughout the ages.) And what, 
deep down, is more interesting than ourselves, the re- 
markable contradiction between our abnormal interest 
in ourselves and the happiness we achieve in total self- 
oblivion. 

Architecture and sculpture, the wall and the people. 

The Last Supper, with the thirteen men at table, and 
any gathering of people whatsoever, anywhere. (Earth) 
(Water) (Air) (Fire) and the smallest unit. 

We produce classical art, because we use generally 
valid themes, the narrative and manifold and visionary 
image. 

The structure of the work of art is a result of the work 
process. The work process is the result of the social con- 
ditions from which or in opposition to which the work of 
art emerges. A work of art is the dream, transformed into 
a material. When we produce monumental art today, it is 
in the desire to alter the conditions of art, and thus also 
the opportunities in our lives for dreaming. 

We will take old images and use them again in a new 
way and make our own history in a word without his- 
tory. 

The only ultimate property things have is that they 
are there. 

Art, in the sixties, acquired a new freedom; quality 
became character, style became structure, and the stuff 
of art was broadened to become anything, anywhere, 
and at any time. 

Our task is not to make realistic demands, because we 
are not politicians. 

Our task is to make unreasonable demands, because 
we are artists. But our unreasonable demands are the 
most realistic. "I'm always looking for an empty street," 
says Nam June Paik. 

I think that art is always on the lookout for "empty 
streets," which is to say new areas in which to make art, 
new ways in which to make it. 

The decisive thing for us when we work together is 
our attitude, a moral responsibility towards the visual 
image. 

The concept of "style" does not exist for us. What 
others call "personal style" or "historical style" is re- 



placed with us by a concept of "raw material," a com- 
mon title of ownership to both the historical and con- 
temporary images, a free flow of information, ideas, 
conceptions, inventions and dreams between people, 
across all frontiers. 

This presupposes that we should start thinking in a 
new way, organize ourselves in a new way, that all of us 
should be able to participate in the decision-making pro- 
cesses, that all of us should take responsibility for the 
decisions, and that all of us should be able to use our 
fantasy and creative capacity wherever we happen to 
live. 

To live is to work. Who is the employer of art? Who 
is anyone's employer? Art defines its own working 
situation, its materials — in our society one confounds 
solidarity with institutions and organization with hier- 
archy. Artists identify themselves with common artistic 
visions and organize themselves into groups in connec- 
tion with exhibitions, festivals, workshops, political par- 
ties and God knows what else in order to fulfill these 
common visions. Just as during the past decade we have 
seen people organize themselves freely in a common 
solidarity around new alternative colleges, residents- 
groups, environmental groups, new parties, working- 
environments, local newspapers, culture centers ... it is 
a social model where everyone is creative. We do not 
make art according to the conditions of the present 
society, but in defiance of those conditions which our 
society presents us with. 

Art has no other justification than its own presence. 
Its only raison d'etre is that we are a group of people 
who insist that there ought to be a place for it, and its 
only standard of quality is its ability to destroy the 
established order and create images of an as yet non- 
existent world. Art must be impressive, social, beautiful, 
simple, classical, manifold, entertaining, amusing, funny, 
expressive, realistic, visionary, human, sublime, monu- 
mental, committed, ugly, direct .... 

We dreamed, in the sixties, of abolishing the physical 
presence of art. Art was to be an idea that could enter 
any kind of context, and function there. And in the 
seventies we produced decorative art, and negotiated— 
with God and man alike. Today such optimism is 
difficult. The visual image is now returning to the can- 
vas, where the conditions for dreams and conceptions 
are more favorable. Municipal authorities are more dif- 
ficult to work with. The "New" painting, or whatever 
we like to call it, is an impatient but graceful gesture. 

When I was small I went about a lot with my grand- 
father, who was almost blind, and when I had difficulty 
in explaining something I would take his great hand and 
draw with my little finger on his palm.

By the means, and the effect, of color, you can 
lend interest to the most commonplace things, and 
make a masterpiece from a bowl, and some fruit. 
But how is this to be achieved? You search, you 
erase, you rub, you glaze, you repaint, and when 
you've captured the "something" that pleases you 
so much, the Picture is complete. 

Jean-Baptiste Simeon Chardin 



La peinture, c'est comme la merde; qa. se sent, qa ne 
s'explique pas.

In the twilight glow I see her 
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain 
When we kissed goodbye and parted 
I knew we'd never meet again 

Love is like a dyin' ember 
And only memories remain 
Through the ages I'll remember 
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain 

Someday when we meet up yonder 
We'll stroll hand in hand again 
In a land that knows no parting 
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

Gangrene 

In September 1980 I opened an exhibition at the Trondheim Art Society 
with twenty-eight paintings (acrylic, oils, tempera and offset) and nine 
transformed objects (a board from a rowing boat, rooftiles, demolition 
material from the conversion of my studio, a protective metal plate, and a 
doormat from the Art Gallery, which served for the following three weeks 
to wipe the dust and antiquated conceptions from people's eyes). All ob- 
jects with a visual potential, and mounted in such a way as to comprise an 
esthetic whole without any formal modifications on my part. I also exhi- 
bited some forty pencil sketches and twenty acrylic sketches, mounted edge 
to edge in the fourth, and smallest, exhibition room. 

The paintings were mainly simple still lifes and interiors of a fairly large 
format, and with painterly references to the entirely specific Nordic variant 
on late French Impressionism. Some of the paintings contained pseudo- 
primitive masks. Four hung free without stretchers, and were painted partly 
in a primitive, abstract style — as symbols and patterns on stretched hides. 
One was a combination of offset and oil painting, based on a photo of Jerry 
Lewis, hung-over in his touring aircraft. The drawings and sketches de- 
scribed details and situations from everyday life. 

For me this exhibition, with its large range, and its juxtaposition of 
paintings, fragments, sketches and ready-mades, was a fairly tough con- 
frontation with the tradition from which I had drawn visual nutrition, 
and I realized that I had somehow or another to revitalize my relationship 
towards it. Otherwise, I should have to stop making pictures. 

It was like discovering that I was suffering from gangrene. I have taught 
periodically as a guest lecturer at the Trondheim Academy of Art, and I 
was asked by the teachers there to produce the occasional work in col- 
laboration with the school. We agreed on three hours instruction in draw- 
ing, but with a view always to confronting the teaching regularly provided 
at the school. The principle, in other words, of tactical confusion. 

As if in a carefully synchronized play of events, I arrived at the school at 
precisely the same moment as two young women students, who have as 
strong a relationship with Punk/Provo as I had to the "Nordic variant of 
late French Impressionism." They had punked themselves into the Coop- 
erative Slaughterhouse in Trondheim, got by the Securitas guard (on the 



123 



pretext that they wanted to buy wool), and were returning to the Academy 
just as I arrived. They had with them two skeletons of goats, five flayed 
cowhides and seven sheep's heads. All these had been slaughtered that same 
morning. I was permitted to borrow the two goat's skeletons, and thus had 
a chance to apply the human whirlwind principle in a three-hour-long 
compressed lesson in drawing, on the basis of two bloody cadavers of 
goats. At the same time, the two students set out the five skins and seven 
chopped-off sheep's heads in various rhythmic patterns on grey paper out 
in the yard (c. 2 x 8 meters). A steaming seance was there enacted, flanked 
by wide-eyed first-year students and teachers, and not without a certain 
amount of blood-dripping ballistics. The flayed cowhides flew through the 
air, before delineating with a wet thud the soft forms that gravitation for 
the moment dictated. The sections cut in the sheep's skulls just behind the 
ears, the raw smell of slaughter, the trancelike motions of the two women, 
the confrontation with something as close to life as death, and the sensitiv- 
ity of the organic material in relation to time— all this led me to experience 
the entire act in clear relationship to my own exhibition. 

One of the sheep's heads described a broad, gliding z-movement, and 
came to rest on its chopped-off surface, turned heavenwards in a bloody 
calligraphic character. This was something of the most beautiful, most 
poetically charged experiences I have ever had. 

Back in Oslo I began to ponder over what had happened in Trondheim. 
The encounter with my own exhibition, and the event that took place at the 
Academy .... I began to think about the heavily burdened tradition of 
painting, the eternally dictated form of the canvas and stretcher, and so on. 
An incessant tomfoolery with tricks to create illusions, and technically 
fixated processes .... The value of what I was doing in relation to the 
economic dictates of the market, and my communication of thoughts, ideas 
and visual possibilities .... I had been referring to visual traditions, and had 
seen myself in a natural extrapolation of these. 

I had to break this dependence, otherwise I would find myself in an 
utterly locked relationship to the job of producing pictures. Until that 
time I had painted objects: now I had to try to transfer my pictures to real 
objects. The concrete canvas, the surface or the thing, without the illusory 



124 



pictorial world, but with the colors as a cover, indicating a visual play and 
a painterly tradition. 

Gradually, I began to envisage solutions in which the pictures were cut 
from their frames, and divided up into different geometric forms. Might 
they then emerge as "objects" with an entirely different "charge" than they 
had had before? 

We set about it in the middle of the exhibition period. Some of the 
students from the Academy came along, both to assist and to take photo- 
graphs throughout the process. Fourteen paintings were cut out and pinned 
back into place. Some of them with solutions defined in advance, while 
others were more or less "caught in the act." Some pictures were indifferent 
after they had been cut, while others were charged with a new energy that 
delighted me. The reactions of the public and my colleagues also suggested 
that the specific field in which painting operates had really been broadened. 
The knife cut into a tradition that people experienced both mentally and 
physically, and for a while the temperature was superbly high. 

I had sawn off the branch on which I had been sitting, and I experienced 
the sense of freedom that arises when you are in free flight, and uncertain 
where you are going to land: you simply enjoy the flight. This was the first 
link in a long chain of possibilities. 

When I used a knife, I could just as well have resorted to a hammer, an 
axe, a plane, electronics or gunpowder. The possibilities of combining con- 
ventional painting with any other materials and techniques whatsoever I felt 
to be legion. I had acknowledged my debt to tradition, and I knew that I 
had to run the entire gauntlet in order to pay it back. Otherwise I should 
only be able in the future to function traditionally, and that is far from 
being part of the duties of a visual artist. 

A journey to Tassiliij n'Ajjer in the heart of the Sahara desert at the turn 
of the year 1981/82, to see the historic rock paintings (between 4,000 and 
6,000 years old), confirmed anew the sense of seeing oneself as part of an 
infinite process of visual communication. 

Anachronistically enough, my most recent pictures are more firmly tied 
to the tradition than previously: the difference is simply that I am now 
working with open doors.

The Oyvind Fahlstrom exhibition has been realized through a collaboration between 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and NUNSKU. 

NUNSKU was founded in 1965 and is the Swedish government's official body dealing 
with the exhibition of contemporary Swedish art abroad. NUNSKU is an independent 
institution, and its Executive Member is the director of Moderna Museet. Its chairman is 
appointed by the government for a term of two years. So far, all its Chairmen have been 
practising artists. The director of the National Swedish Art Museums is an ex officio 
member. The Board's other members are painters, sculptors, graphic artists, architects, art 
critics, and representatives of the Swedish Institute and the Swedish Travelling Exhibitions, 
all appointed by the government.

Acknowledgments 



The realization of the Oyvind Fahlstrom exhibition and the eatalouge that accompanies it 
depended upon the participation of many individuals and agencies. Pontus Hulten, my 
co-commissioner, joins me in thanking all those who have contributed to our project. Our 
grateful acknowledgment is due first to Bjorn Springfeldt, Senior Curator of the Moderna 
Museet, Stockholm, who acted as curator of the exhibition and edited the catalogue. Louise 
Averill Svendsen, Senior Curator of the Guggenheim Museum, skillfully performed the 
crucial task of coordinating all aspects of this undertaking. Our thanks also go to Lennart 
Landin for masterfully designing the catalogue. Members of virtually every department of 
the Guggenheim Museum were involved in the often complex preparations for exhibition 
and publication, and our appreciation of their efforts is hereby expressed. 

We also wish to thank Sharon Avery Fahlstrom, widow of the artist, for her constant 
interest and advice; Olle Granath, Director, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, for his many 
kindnesses; John Wipp, Chairman, National Committee for the Exhibition of Swedish 
Contemporary Art Abroad (NUNSKU), Stockholm, for his generous support; Mrs. 
Birgitta Lonnell, Press Attache, Swedish Information Service, New York, for her helpful 
assistance throughout; the Fahlstrom at the Guggenheim Advisory Committee and its 
Honorary Chairman, Countess Wachtmeister, for their active involvement. Our gratitude 
also goes to Tom Geddes who undertook the difficult task of translating Fahlstrom's 
poetry. Sincere gratitude is expressed as well to the collectors of Fahlstrom's works who 
entrusted their possessions to our custody. The names of these generous individuals and 
public institutions are cited on the preceding page. 

Museums cannot, in today's economy, accomplish exhibitions and publications of 
ambitious scope without financial assistance. We were fortunate indeed to receive generous 
sponsorship for the Fahlstrom project from the National Committee for the Exhibition of 
Swedish Contemporary Art Abroad (NUNSKU), Stockholm, the Swedish Institute, 
Stockholm, and the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, D.C. Our thanks 
are offered to these agencies for their essential support.

Winnie-the-Pooh for UN Secretary! 

Olle Granath 



There was something of the prophet about Oyvind Fahlstrom. His paintings, articles, 
plays, films and manifestos were like stones splashing down on to the surface of time, and 
one could sit years afterwards watching the ripples still spreading. But he differed from the 
prophets of old in that there was little of the mystic or ecstatic about him. He often spoke 
or wrote of "ecstatic communities," "satori experiences" and drug trips. But when he 
himself was trying to describe the world in which he, for better or for worse, had been 
placed, he set to work with a more sober passion. He collected facts with a mind open 
equally to broad essentials and to the trivial, the odd and the bizarre. 

Fahlstrom could probably have been one of the most successful journalists of his 
generation, in all media: "I see myself as a witness rather than as an educator." But 
journalism forced him into simplifications, necessitated by the superficial presentation of 
facts, and with these he could not be satisfied: "As a witness, I have become increasingly 
absorbed by the emotional significance in many of the facts and events in the world." 

Towards the end of the fifties he lived for a while in Rome, and he could write of a 
Sunday afternoon's "quiet jiving in the cool, vaulted cellars of Rugantino's" in such a way 
that we realize this was an experience not to be missed. At the same time he wrote of the 
paintings of Afro, Scialoja and Capogrossi, which were then still new and alien claims 
staked in a field of art with which he himself experienced great kinship. In 1961 Fahlstrom 
moved to settle in New York. From there, over a succession of years, he was to furnish 
Sweden with written and filmed reports of both its art and its society. His wilful sign- 
painting was transformed by his encounter with New York and its art world, and he 
returned to Stockholm to stage the sort of mixed-media performances then known as 
"happenings." 

The structure of the happening very much suited Fahlstrom, with his interest in the 
dramatic productions of opera. In a happening he was able to mix the sublime with the 
trivial, sweeping perspectives with a myopic scrutiny of detail. In this way he could get 
what he called the "hard material of reality" to yield new and unexpected meanings. This 
method had fascinated him ever since the early fifties, when he began to take an interest in 
concrete poetry and its arbitrary dissection of the language to win new meanings from it. It 
was the classical metaphor, as he had once encountered it in Surrealism, that Fahlstrom 
subsequently took with him when he set out on new adventures. In Arthur Koestler he 
found the concept of "bisociation," which lent further support to his method. Fahlstrom 
interpreted Koestler as follows: ". . . when you find piece A and find a piece B, and there's a 
violent ignition when you rub A against B! In other words, the result is something entirely 
different, and much greater, than the sum of the two." 

Fahlstrom gave the impression of having been affected as a very young man by the 
contradictory, incomprehensible and incoherent nature of existence. The experience im- 
bued his work with an undertone of tragedy, but he devoted all his energy — and it was 
considerable — to overcoming these obstacles to an understanding of the world and his place 



11 



in it. In an interview given not very long before he died, he put it in these words: ". . . to 
achieve a union of understanding and enjoyment, to give expression to the frightening 
brevity of life, and to our terrible inadequacy in a world in which we have to struggle for 
our experiences and to create happiness." 

It is in remarks like this that we meet the antiauthoritarian disposition so basic to his 
character. The right to your own life, and to its experiences, however odd and deviant these 
may be, was central to Fahlstrom, and determined his attitude towards all forms of 
authority, and all deployment of power. He saw one possibility of formulating this 
poetically in the game, with its contrast between strict rules and hard facts on the one hand, 
and the interventions of chance on the other. 

The independence and integrity that Fahlstrom could demonstrate in his relationship to 
what went on around him resembled at times that of the child who pointed to the Emperor 
in the parade and said aloud what everyone could see— that the Emperor was naked! The 
revolutionary element in Fahlstrom was that he never renounced this possibility. His 
incredible ability to gather facts on the state of the world, and then release them in the form 
of a narrative with elements of the strip cartoon, or a game that borrowed its character 
from Monopoly, reflected this quality of clearsightedness. The Emperor was constantly 
paraded naked through his paintings, plays, films and reportage. Over the years the parade 
became a long one indeed, the participants in which included Albert Schweitzer, Winnie- 
the-Pooh, Henry Kissinger, Krazy Kat, Richard Nixon, Mao and Bob Hope, to name only 
a few. 

It can be dangerous to draw excessive conclusions from details in the early life of an 
artist. At the same time, it seems increasingly clear that Modernism in particular is filled 
with oeuvres whose fate has been to reconstruct or hold fast a fleeting childhood. The 
artist's work has emerged as a protest at being bereft of a state which allows the world to 
emerge as precisely pleasurable and horrific, malleable and implacable as it appears to the 
child. 

Fahlstrom's works are full of references to the polymorphously perverse, to the infantile 
tensions that find their release in the violence of the strip cartoon, to a world-historv 
sub|ect to the rules laid down for the puzzles and games with which he was kept amused as 
a child. 

An episode in Fahlstrom's life may have contributed to this, namely the )Ourney he made 
one summer, at the age of eleven, from Brazil — where he was born — to Sweden. The year 
was 1939, and owing to the outbreak of war it was to be eight whole years before he was 
reunited with his parents. This involuntary divorce from a familiar environment, and from 
the people closest to him, created in him an alienation, which provided the starting point 
for his colossal, encyclopedic labor to create a world in which his right of domicile was 
beyond question. In the loneliness in which this labor was performed lay also the founda- 
tion of his rejection of authority. Owing to external circumstances beyond its control, the 
child became independent, and so remained. Fahlstrom created a protective cover around 
the child's independence of conventional values, and its unconfused eye. His creative 
energy stemmed from this protective zone. 

He was also able to preserve, in this zone, a purity, which characterized his every action. 
The energy with which he intervened in the affairs of the world, and of art, seemed 
powered by a dry fire which burned clean everything he touched. In the ashes left in his 
wake, the patterns of the constellations of power, and their manipulations, appeared with 
devastating clarity. Fahlstrom was the only person I have met who could use the word 
happiness in such a way that you really felt it to mean something. 



12 



It was from this strict, unconfused view of the world, that he was able to propose that 
everyone should be allocated free food, that little Sweden should be made a field of 
experiment for unilateral disarmament, and that every community should erect a great 
House of Pleasure, in which all the obstacles to sensual and intellectual enjoyment created 
by our social taboos would be eliminated. 

When we study Fahlstrom's works of art, or browse in the huge volumes of text, 
published and unpublished, in verse and in prose, that he left behind, there are moments 
when we seem to see the state of the world with the same clear eyes as he did. His proposals 
and models then appear plainly superior to the solutions we are continuously accepting in 
the name of so-called rationality. Fahlstrom's unique strength as a poetic witness lay in his 
ability constantly to keep the vision alive. He never stopped talking about the nakedness of 
the Emperor.

Has the locust-milk curdled yet in the god's crooked eyes? 

unfortunately 

the stomach-horn 

though droning 

has been fixed within us so that not even the storm 

through the pine trees which have waded through the ocean and are now coming 

ashore can prevent their own nose-blood streaming into us 
while the foghorns of excrement throw up coconuts 

and fountains of brooches in mating colors shatter the walls around your head 
now the homeless march off by the thousand 
naked crouching and with a plate on their arse 
and an enemy hand 

each one has an enemy hand upon him some hold on to one's face 
others to one's sex tongue foot chest 
an iron grip which closes ever tighter 
penetrates ever deeper all one can do is have patience 
if one tries to break free of it the fingers bore into one's flesh 
and the whole hand disappears into one's entrails one feels it 
dreadfully sharply closing around the bowels 
gripping the stomach so that the food flies out 
boring its way through liver and abdomen 
plays a moment at crushing the windpipe 
and then approaches the heart 

first it strokes the heart a while tickles and scratches 
every moment one thinks is the last 
but one must not stop moving 
and then suddenly it grips the heart 
and crushes it like a glove 

only then does one fall and from the black saliva at the mouth 
it is clear what sort of death one died 

and for its sake probosces glide through the earth like periscopes 
sticking up in the fields of corn 
waving whistling 
and set off alarm clocks to sound the knell of death in the stomachs of us all

Opera began with my discovery of the felt-tip pen in 1952. With this, I could work not only with a fairly precise, even blackness like 
India ink, but also with gradations of gray which were not fuzzy like pencil drawings; the felt tip also produced random textures. The 
pleasurable "spontanism" in that method of working felt monotonous after a while. I began to put together some of the sheets on which I 
had drawn, and could see continuity and larger schemes beginning to appear.

BEFORE EIGHT 



Before eight her father had always followed behind her and picked them up. Now 
he was dead. 

Her breasts had been coming loose for a long time, and she had tried to press them 
hard against her body so that they would grow back into place. She began to nourish 
them with ultraviolet lamps, but that merely accelerated the charring. To prevent it 
spreading to the rest of her body, she held them away from herself. 

She borrowed an arm to lay over the exposed dark patches. Since it was living 
flesh it grew into place. Precious as it was, she would divert attention by carving on it; 
she called the closely woven intricate patterns "Skeletons of the gods." Otherwise only 
the gentle chink of teacups could be heard; it was dark in the room except for the bed 
in the ultraviolet glow. Some of the guests were hairdressers with their wives. Several 
of the wives had also worked for many years in the same business. Some had reached a 
venerable age, others were younger. Engagement rings glittered on their fingers. 

When the new maid came in, the flapping of her apron stirred up the ashes of the 
breasts in her hands. They had died. 

At the same moment she had a vision of swans' wings beating against the 
ultraviolet lamp, there was a sudden radiance, and the table was laid. The wind howled 
outside. The maid had to bite off her hands and feet to be able to get into the bed where 
she herself and the maid, with the help of the ashes, were moulded into a dough which 
was laid to rise in a moist lump, so that they would no longer be two, but one. One 
happy person. 

In the exquisitely beautiful bower the wind was howling. It was as large as a 
basilica, a group of ancient trees which had curved inwards to form a vaulted canopy to 
prevent themselves collapsing, their arched crowns meeting much higher up on one side 
than the other. There were cows standing there, row upon row just as in a normal cow 
shed, ghostly white with patches like irregular leaf-shadows moving in the wind. But 
what was not visible was the milk thief creeping in every night beneath their sleeping 



/ also saw that various different ideas, joined together as an entity, produced shifts: unexpected, "unnatural" events on the paper. 1 was 
interested at that time in Pre-Columbian Mexican book-paintings, which evolved from page to page in long panels, folded in concertina 
fashion. And in music— as a graphic artist, I lacked the temporal dimension that exists in music. I particularly liked the "impure" mixture 
of concert and theater to be found in opera |The Ring of the Nibelungs, for example!)

bodies, holding tight as she climbed in, her hands clasped around the ends of their gently 
swaying tails, her mouth round the udders sucking them dry. And thus she moved on 
from cow to cow. 

But while she lived in luxury and abundance with the cows, with the slaves, with 
her property, with her animals, the peasants were suffering the most extreme deprivation, 
suppressed and governed by the pigs. 

While she could eat freely of all the people she had frightened, wash them from 
morning till night, blow them up with air so that they could float, gently prod them so 
that they floated up to heaven, and pull them down with a string when they lay there 
floating on the surface among the rest of the dead — the peasants were having to toil for 
their lives long into the night, as the sweat froze and chilled their emaciated bodies, torn 
by splinters from jagged fences with every step they took, fighting with packs of wolves 
for a supper of bitter vegetables, if they were not carried off to the swamp by the wolves 
and sucked down into the deep in a bloody embrace with the hairy beasts, if before dawn 
broke and it was time to go out to work in the fields again without food without sleep 
without a moment's rest in the well-built hut where the pigs slept by day, at least 
provided they did not prefer to trample to death the little children who seemed to be 
born with a flick of the wrist constantly more and constantly fewer, but that was against 
the pigs' habits because they had to be fresh and awake at night when father finally if he 
came home came home. He hardly dared creep into a corner furthest from the fire to 
stroke his wife's hands, red from the tears she had had to choke back all day, if she had 
survived the treatment the pigs had subjected her to (they usually thrust her into the oven 
and roasted her when she was going to bathe them before dinner in the huge blue clay 
tub which shattered every day when they lay in it and which her little ones had to mould 
anew every morning often standing naked in the ice-cold stream until late at night, if the 
pigs had not previously made the children insult them so that they had to fight duels with 
the pigs who knocked them down head-first into the sand to practice somersaults over 
their naked toes, the only part sticking up; if none of that happened, they used to sneak 
in when the fire was crackling loudest in order not to be noticed, and lie down motionless 
on the floor in the hope that the pigs would think them dead of overexertion, hunger and 
lack of sleep, a thing which always happened sooner or later, for they were so poor that

all the dishes in the pantry were licked clean by the pigs (tor whom the food was made): 
there was hardly a scrap left over for the tiniest, since all the mother's milk was consumed 
by the pigs; no, pigs as we all know are omnivorous, and the miserable bit of money that 
the family had earned by the end of the year all went on replacing the china that the pigs 
had swallowed; they had to lie on the floor, they could not afford so much as a sheaf of 
blackened corn for supper from the stall where the dead horse stood, not so much as a 
Good Night father Good Night dear, they could not even afford to throw away their 
own excrement, but went to town every week and sold it, getting enough by the end of 
the year for a handful of chaff from the shopkeeper; how many times had father, tears 
mingling with the sweat of his brow, had to beat it out of his children who fought a 
desperate battle to hold it in, since then the hunger did not feel so bad; at other times 
they had nothing to offer, but accepted the lashes without a word, accustomed as they 
were to not complaining; it was also important that they did not get so thin that the pigs 
did not want to lie on them at night, for then they would often pick up mother trembling 
with drowsiness, to lie on one of the magnificent beds from grandfather's time, only to 
knock her to the floor a moment later with the most severe reproaches; after a few hours 
the pigs would sometimes ease off a little from their jokes, and if you just breathed in 
time with them it was actually far from unbearable to lie under them, it was nice and 
warm and you didn't need to move, nor did it last long, in a while it was time to get up 
and go to work and make a meal for the pigs, who were always very punctual, to go out 
to the kitchen and start the fire in the stove that took up almost the whole kitchen and 
was covered with stone tiles, while the smallest had to go out into the forest in the dark 
to cut wood and pick fresh blackberries if the pigs did not want to have a ride through 
the forest to work up an appetite, but generally everything took its normal course and 
everyone was content with each day he was alive, for if we demanded everything of life, 
what would the world be like then? 

Now a dog has stuck to the windowpane again so that nothing can be seen. Several 
weeks pass. 

Everyone knew that her house was on the top of a mountain. It had once slipped 
down from a higher mountain and landed on this mountain. But nobody knew that the 



The idea of a game "was my current interest at the time I was writing the "Manifesto for Concrete Literature." There too I expressed 
impatience with the monotony and private nature of pure automatism. One ought to be able to make simple rules for oneself, create 
frames of reference within the work of art. The simplest fundamental rule in Opera was: repetition. It felt then like a big discovery: not 
(merely) a continuous sequence of constantly changing motifs, but a decision — this one is important, this shall have a rule. Recurring in 
new contexts, and recurring altered, but recognizable.

top was a crater which had its opening in the toilet which took up almost the whole 
bathroom. A huge ass's skin was stretched over the toilet, and she used to dance on it 
until she fell down. Then she would remove the skin and sit down on the opening of a 
pipe which reached down into the depths of the volcano. The pressure forced the lava up 
and into her until she was completely filled by it; then she emptied herself and sucked in 
new. Nothing could give her such a feeling of all-consuming pleasure. 

When she left the bathroom she was always full. What she liked best was to lie 
down and sleep heavy with lava: the worst thing was to wake up in the middle of the 
night and suddenly feel absolutely empty. She always slept under the bed. 

So nobody heard when air first started seeping out of her. In the morning she felt 
a little fragile in the armpits, but she did not think much of it and went straight out to the 
rooms to look at the soberly dressed civilians walking everywhere through the house 
according to carefully planned routes so that there were always some, and about ten in 
the lounge, going through every room in the house. From time to time she could no 
longer contain herself and burst out in resounding laughter. In the evenings she would 
change parts of the body on them ready for the next day ("crop" them, as she used to 
say), and then hang them up from the ceiling. Thus several years went by. 

One afternoon when she had been trying on hats for twins, the one more oddly 
shaped than the other, until her whole head ached, she went into the next room without 
looking round and at that very moment was met by a deafening noise in the middle of 
the room and had difficulty in breathing. Her whole head was bursting with the force of 
the air from her body pressing against the air from the walls meeting with no chance of 
mingling and with the burstingpoint gradually coming closer and closer because the 
surface of the walls was much greater and the nearer she came the more surfaces began 
to release air pressure as protection against her own. The whole room looked like a 
book bound in invisible fish-scales, with pages made of cauliflower leaves, the fish 
inside, and the walls a steep pitched roof beneath and herself a new small roof on the roof 
and the air the house. 

A door had broken away behind her and was now driven inexorably forward in 
the force of the air from the overpowering pressure of the walls; the whole lurching 
reeling door had a blue turbulent surface. The pressure on her increased tenfold, even her 



19 



clothes were compelled bv the external pressure to take sides against her and tightened 
around her soft flesh like rubber gloves. 

Maddened by exhaustion and pain she shut her eyes and ripped off her clothes. 
Then suddenly she felt the pain expanding to fill her whole body, except for her legs 
which still had stockings on; she pulled them off without daring to open her eyes. The 
pain rose in a massive wave from her legs up through her whole body, a wave of aching 
swelling pressure which had now begun to advance from various points of her body, 
outwards, upwards. She was giving birth to herself, from every part her whole body was 
going through the process of being born again to be able to withstand the battle against 
the walls, against the whole house which was relentlessly squeezing her into her own self. 

She realized that the pressure on her at that moment was so intense that her own 
air pressure was turned in against herself as her clothes had been; so all hope of rescue 
was lost, and imprisoned in her new body which would not be able to be born, she 
would slowly be crushed to extinction by the pressure of the walls. 

She could do nothing, she still kept her eyes closed to avoid having to see her 
body, which was as blue as an abscess, and all the time it was as if a heavy paralysis had 
laid itself over the back of her head and robbed her of the ability to think, so that she 
stood in the middle of the room consciously unconscious and just felt the pressure 
surging out of her and towards her. 

The bursting open of the door had produced a counterpressure from the walls of 
the adjacent room, but the nearest walls were in the way. Hardly had she begun to feel 
the difference, when the walls cracked, but at that moment her new body managed to 
force its way forward a little in her and her own counterpressure was strengthened in the 
face of the attack from the walls of the new room and from the three remaining walls of 
the room in which she stood. 

But all this takes far too long to describe for the other doors and then the walls 
had shattered she had managed to force herself one stage closer to birth the nearest walls 
had collapsed under the pressure which now held her nailed like a board in the air while 
the walls exploded in a furious rhythm alternating with her contractions which bore her 
higher and higher in the air until the pressure from the whole of the collapsing lower 
storey overturned the whole upper storev the pressure from which no longer had 
anything to impede it but hurled itself out into the air so that she herself was flung down 
to the ground and finally burst.

the tomatoes have stuck on your points on the pitch-stained house walls 
oh what a crunching there is when the masts are bitten to bare your stomach 
where organs resounding are boiled from soap 
and teeth rain down 

if I only knew where the fanfare which leads to the handrail across the river to your 

head writ large in 

every note has its coat of arms 

every neck its yolk 

but this mist streaming from my stomach 

for it is my entrails' playtime 

so that I can see nothing whichever way I turn 

nothing wrong with my pee it has all its bees on guard but if someone in the mist should want 

bkrpt there 

squeeze the spleen out of me and run away as fast as it can 

luckily I have a safety cord on my belt so it won't get far 

now there was a sudden ]erk 

But I should never have said anything 

Now the whole lot leapt out of me and are pulling 

me away with their cords I have no chance when there are twenty of them 

if I were to lay myself on the ground they would drag me 

helpless as someone caught hiding in a lavatory I was led away by my own spider's web 

into a cinema they go of course I sit down 

as my entrails immediately begin to kiss the whole audience 

who luckily notice nothing because the film is on 

but what will happen when the lights go up 

soon all the audience's entrails have been enticed out and are engaged in a frenzied fancy dress party 

when the lights go on the whole ceiling is full of newborn entrails in their turn giving birth 

and a whimpering of all those that cannot find their way back 

and all that are in the process of dying 

and all that do not want to be parted and all the newborn 

then I feel myself suddenly so devoid of all echoes 

that I kiss my neighbor so hard 

that the suction passes right through him to the next who is sucked into him until the whole 

audience is inseparably united in 
the same kiss 

then the manager climbs on to the podium in his wife's feather boa 
which immediately turns frigid and is transformed into a sunset 
and welcomes us

O.F.: HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY 

From Manifesto for Concrete Poetry (1953) 



"Since inviting about a hundred dogs to my home for a 
two-week course on lyric poetry some time ago, I have gone 
over to writing worlets (words, letters)." 

"Remplacer la psychologie de l'homme . . . par L'OBSES- 
SION LYRIQUE DE LA MATIERE" (Manifesto for 
Futurist Literature, 1912). 

1. The present situation 

. . . Poetry is not just for analysis, but is also created as a 
structural entity. And not just as a structure with the em- 
phasis on the expression of ideas, but also as a concrete 
structure. Let us take our leave of the systematic or unsys- 
tematic depiction of all kinds of personal-psychological, 
contemporary-cultural or universal problems. Words are 
symbols, of course, but that is no reason for not being able 
to experience and create poetry on the basis of language as 
concrete matter. 

The fact that words have a symbolic value is no more 
remarkable than representational forms in the visual arts 
having a symbolic value over and above what they super- 
ficially represent, or non-figurative forms, even a white 
square on a white canvas, also having symbolic value, also 
providing broader associations, beyond our experience of 
the interplay of proportions. 

The situation is this: ever since the War there has been a 
lasting, melancholy, doom-ridden mood, a feeling that all 
experimental extremes have been exhausted. For those who 
do not wish to drift into the intoxicating worlds of either 
heavenly or alcoholic spirits, all that remains with the means 
available to us is to analyze 
analyze 
analyze our wretched human condition. 

Today when labored symbolic cryptograms, romantic 
effusions of beautiful words or anguished, contorted faces 
outside the church gate seem to be the only marketable 
alternatives, the alternative of concrete form must also be 
put forward. 

Its fundamental principle is: everything that can be ex- 
pressed in language and every linguistic expression has equal 



status in any context if it enhances the significance of that 
context. 

The problems explored by Dostoievsky thus seem to me 
no more substantial or human than speculation on whether 
men's voices are more beautiful as hosts than as worlds. (A 
reference to O.F.'s own poem "The Large and the Small.") 
The subject of a play need not be a poet or a dictator in a 
particular temporal situation, but could equally well consist 
of the established fact that a particular sound can never be 
repeated. The results of experimental psychology can be 
used as the basis for a prose work just as well as those of 
psychoanalysis. I depict certain characters, Bob, Tom, Steve, 
Mary, Pat, without the least interest in them as human 
beings. Literature is not inhuman because of that. Ants 
would only write books about ants, but human beings, with 
their ability to be objective and take a wider perspective, do 
not need to be so one-sided. 



2. Material and media 

What is to be made of the new material? Of course it can be 
shaken up and reconstituted in any form whatsoever and can 
then be regarded from a "concrete" viewpoint as always 
equally viable? 

That can always be said in the early stages. But the fact 
that the new media of expression have not yet had their 
evaluative criteria established, need not prevent us examin- 
ing these new media, if our criteria are ever going to be 
clarified. 

One method is to oppose as often as possible the law of 
least resistance. Law-lea-res. That is no guarantee of success, 
but it is one way of not standing still on the same spot. 
Utilize systems as well as automatism, preferably in com- 
bination, but only as a means to an end. So, refrain from 
ambitions of achieving the "purest" poetry by means of 
automatism; even the Surrealists no longer advocate that. 
And there is nothing wrong with systems: if one chooses 
them oneself, and does not follow conventional ones. It is 
thus not a question of whether the system in itself is The 
Only Right One. It will be right because one has chosen it 
and if it gives good results. 



26 



Thus, for example, I can construct a series of twelve 
vowels in a certain order and make my worlets out of them, 
even though a twelve vowel series as such does not have the 
same conventional justification as a series of the twelve tones 
of the chromatic scale. 

Much is said about the yearning of the modern age for a 
fixed code of values. One thing is certain: now that we have 
grown tired of rigid meter, regular rhythms, and finally even 
of rhyme, we must find something else to give a poem unity. 
Nowadays there is a tendency for the unifying element to be 
the content, both in terms of the subject described and the 
ideas it represents. But it is best if form and content function 
as one. 

What remains, therefore, is to endow form again with its 
own system of values. That has already been done, for 
example, in contrapuntal music. The possibilities are endless. 
In poetry there can be fractured stanzas with vertical paral- 
lelism, so that the content provides the form by the fact that 
when a word is repeated, it must be placed exactly under the 
last occurrence of the same word, or vice versa, so that when 
part of a line is put vertically in parallel with one above, it 
brings with it the meaning of the line above. Identical stan- 
zas aided by linefilling with the rhyme on the final word in 
the line, or with corresponding syllables, words, etc. Mar- 
ginal stanzas by the side of main stanzas. Framework stanzas 
having a nucleus stanza within: the possibility of several 
interpretations corresponding to the free movement of the 
eyes when looking at abstract art. That is to say, stanzas 
which can be read not only from left to right and from top to 
bottom, but also vice versa, and vertically: all the first words 
in each line, then all the second, third, and so on. Mirror- 
writing, diagonal reading. Inversion of lines, especially of 
short lines. Free stress and free word-order, as in classical 
literature. (The fact that we do not have the same linguistic 
conditions for that is no argument.) The profusion of possi- 
bilities enables us to achieve a greater complexity and func- 
tional differentiation, in which each of the various parts of 
the content of a work acquires its own form. 

The simplest of all systematizations of formless material is 
as always the alternation of antitheses, antitheses within all 
conceivable aspects of the work of art. The interplay of 
difficult and easy sentences (or paragraphs, or words), of the 
magniloquent and the simple, the syntactically normal and 
primitively cumulative, some related and some unrelated to 
their context, the airy and the ponderous, the halting and the 
smooth, the onomatopoeic and the mimetic. 

Not just simple alternations, but also intensification — and 
rhythms. Anything except the comfortable predictable ca- 



dences of Lawleares. (Of course, it is another matter if 
amorphous sections are inserted with intentional, directed 
effect.) 

Above all, I believe that the creation of rhythmic forms 
provides undreamt-of possibilities. Rhythm is not just the 
most elemental, directly physical and tangible medium; it is 
the pleasure of recognizing something already known, it is 
the significance of repetition; it is connected with the rhyth- 
mic pulse of breathing, blood circulation and ejaculation. It 
is wrong to think that the jazz band has a monopoly of 
inducing collective rhythmic ecstasy. Drama and poetry can 
also produce it. It can even be done in the visual arts, with 
their limited temporal dimension, as Capogrossi has demon- 
strated. 

The solution is to break away from always churning out 
the new, new, new; not to leave behind a litter-bin full of 
designs for every step one takes in a work: to stick instead to 
motifs, let them repeat themselves, form rhythms: to work 
for example with infilling rhythmic words as a foundation 
for main sentences, which can be either bound by or free 
from the background rhythm. Independent onomatopoeic 
rhythmic phrases, similar to the ones constructed by an 
African or Indian drummer to characterize his rhythmic 
melodies. Simultaneous reading, and above all recitation of 
several lines, of which at least one consists of rhythmic 
words. Metrical rhythms too, of course; rhythmic word- 
order, rhythmic spaces. 

Another method of achieving unity and coherence is to 
extend the logic by creating new correspondences and new 
logical progressions. The simplest course is to turn to the 
logic of primitive peoples, of children and of the mentally ill, 
which abolishes contradictions, the logic of simile, of sym- 
pathetic magic. 

Applying that logic to language: like-sounding words be- 
long together; jokes even depend on them. Rhyme can func- 
tion similarly. Myths have been explained in this way: when 
Deucalion and Pyrrha wanted to create new human beings 
after the Flood, they threw stones, and men and women 
grew from them: the word for stone was laas, and for 
people, laos. 

Consequently if I hear of firing, I am not sure whether 
someone has been shot, burnt or dismissed. Figs are related 
to figment, pigs to pigmentation, but not vice versa. 
Homonyms are also rich in possibilities. Syllepsis belongs to 
this category too: uniting words, sentences and paragraphs; 
for example, "poetry is poetry is poetry," where the middle 
"poetry" is both beginning and end. And for a whole work, 
the word "curvo" inserted at intervals, always grammati- 



27 



cally uninflected, is just as good a cohesive agent for the 
structure as a single idea carried right through. Always that 
precious element of repetition to provide the joy of rec- 
ognition. 

Particularly in the more discursive art forms of epic and 
drama, and also film, one has to create a course of events of 
the same structural stability as reality itself. Give new func- 
tions to the component parts and then really exploit them, 
instead of using the easy improvisations that flow from 
inspiration; and weave a tight and distinct net of relation- 
ships. Adhere to the conventions you have constructed 
yourself, but not to those of others. 

With such rich possibilities, ordinary interpretations and 
antitheses such as tragic and comic must be a facile simpli- 
fication. The value of the relationship pig/pigmentation does 
not, therefore, consist entirely in the humorous effect which 
can come from the unexpected juxtaposition. 

Another form of magic with the resources of language is 
to be found in what might be conventionally seen as the 
arbitrary attribution of new meanings to letters, words, sen- 
tences or paragraphs: we could say that all i's in a particular 
worlet denote "sickness," the more there are, the more 
serious the illness — or the word "sickness" in a specific 
paragraph denotes "all sounds," or "profits" — or that all 
verbs, in addition to their lexical meaning, also denote 
"cold." 

One can take a step in that direction by putting well- 
known words in such a completely unfamiliar context that 
one undermines the reader's certainty of the sacred re- 
lationship between the word and its meaning, and makes 
him experience the conventional meanings as )ust as arbit- 
rary or just as certain as the newly-attributed meanings. This 
phenomenon is nowhere more remarkable than in the case of 
Povel Ramel, the man who suffered among other things 
from stage fright, and spoke of his fever mounting in stages, 
so that we became aware— in this case both through the 
situation and the word-similarity — of a new meaning in the 
word "stage." 

That is not to say that the appearance of the well-known 
in a strange context arouses in everyone a productive uncer- 
tainty about the contiguity of word and phenomenon. It 
may perhaps stimulate an equally fruitful interest in the form 
itself, that is if the sentences in question are so meaningless 
to the reader and his interest sufficiently aroused that he 
continues looking for significance. Many sentences appear at 
first to be without significance, neither particularly funny 
nor poignant, neither pregnant with meaning nor vaguely 
sonorous. 



Not least because they contain unacceptable words. Un- 
acceptable words are those that despite the enormous expan- 
sion of poetic vocabulary during the last half century, are 
still not regarded as poetically viable. "Shopkeepers," "en- 
thusiasm," "clubs," "expression," "atrocious," "whisk," 
"guys," "dozen," "gland." They occur, of course, but how 
often compared with the old guard? Reading a dictionary is 
just as rich in discoveries for a language-artist as browsing 
through a manual on insects, car engines or the body's 
tissues can be for a graphic artist. 

Sentences can also seem empty of meaning by being con- 
structed in a different way. This involves not just changing 
the word order, but shuffling the whole inbuilt clausal struc- 
ture; and because thought processes are dependent on lan- 
guage, every attack on prevailing forms of language ulti- 
mately enriches worn-out modes of thought, thus constitut- 
ing a stage in the development of language itself— and those 
thought processes always take place on three levels: the 
everyday, the literary and the academic. 

Ideas for the renewal of sentence structure can come from 
making comparisons with foreign languages. Chinese, for 
example, with its lack of parts of speech, and its dependence 
on word order for meaning; or the unexpected nuances of 
expression in the languages of many primitive peoples. But it 
is perhaps more important, and anyway easier, to investigate 
the language of the mentally ill. Looking at tests on manic- 
depressives, for instance, one finds effects, admittedly not 
artistically intended, such as word combinations (con- 
tamination), pure sound-associations, word constructions 
(neologisms), and almost rhythmical reiteration (persev- 
eration). 

Another method is to see what can be made use of in 
language produced purely mechanically, by choosing new 
directions in which to read, or by arranging words and 
sentences in sequential chains. We must slowly push back 
the frontiers of meaning. We can find undreamt-of value in 
the— from our present viewpoint — most truncated and dis- 
jointed word and sentence structures. 

MANIPULATE the material of language: that is what 
will justify a label such as concrete. Manipulate not just 
overall structures: rather, begin with the smallest elements, 
letters, words. Move letters around, as in anagrams. Repeat 
letters in words; intersperse alien words: gla-ten-dly; alien 
letters: aacataiaoana for action; explore children's secret 
code languages and other private languages; vowel glides: 
glaeiouwdly. And of course "lettristic," newly invented 
words. Abbreviationmania to coin neologisms, exactly as in 
everyday language — we already have Lawleares. It is always 



28 



a matter of reshaping the material and not allowing oneself 
to be reshaped by it. The fundamental principle of concrete 
poetry can perhaps best be illustrated by Pierre Schaeffer's 
key experience during his search for concrete music: he had 
on tape a few seconds of railway engine noise, but was not 
content just to follow that noise with another, even if the 
juxtaposition was an unusual one. Instead he cut out a little 
fragment of the engine noise and repeated that fragment with 
slightly altered pitch; then went back to the first, then the 
second, and so on, to give an alternation. Only then had he 
created; he had performed an operation on the material itself 
by cutting it up: the elements were not new; but the new 
whole which had been formed had created new matter. 

It will be clear from this that what I have called concrete 
literature is not a style, any more than concrete music or 
non-figurative visual art is. It is partly a way for the reader to 
experience literary art, primarily poetry, and partly a liber- 
ation for the poet, putting at his disposal all linguistic mate- 
rial and all the means to work on it. Literature which is 
created on that basis is therefore neither in opposition to nor 
identical with Lettrism or Dada and Surrealism. 

Lettrism: both normal "descriptive" and "lettristic" 
words can be understood as both form and content: the 
"descriptive" provide a stronger experience of content and a 
weaker experience of form, "lettristic" vice versa— a differ- 
ence only of degree. 



If one looks at the actual creations of Surrealist poetry, 
they appear to have certain similarities with worlets. But 
there is a difference in the point of departure which ulti- 
mately must have an effect on the results: the concrete 
reality of my worlets is not at all in opposition to the reality 
of their surroundings: they are neither dream-sublimation 
nor futuristic fantasy, but an organic part of the reality I am 
living in, although with their own principles for life and 
development. 

A coquettish or anguished contortion, and even more the 
nihilism of Dada, can be productive if one looks at the 
artistic result; here again it is the point of departure that 
counts: I can find no reason to talk of contortion and nihilis- 
tic negation, I have no feeling of an artistic construct, of an 
unusual state of affairs— this is normality. A constructive 
Dadaism and thus not Dada at all. 

When I have used the word "concrete" in these contexts, 
it has a stronger association with concrete music than with 
visual concretism in a narrow sense. Also, of course, the 
concrete poet is in the tradition of formalists and language 
manipulators of all ages: the Greeks, Rabelais, Gertrude 
Stein, Schwitters, Artaud, and many others. And he looks up 
in veneration not only to Owl in Winnie the Pooh but also to 
Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty, who regards every ques- 
tion as a riddle and imbues words with unfathomable mean- 
ings. 

1953 



Ilmar Laaban: Oyvind Fahlstrom, CONCRETE POET 



One of Oyvind Fahlstrom's plays is entitled "The Hard and 
the Soft." Its thesis is that the excessively hard requires 
"taxation, " while the excessively soft requires the appli- 
cation of order or "taxation." A "lax" and a "tax" are the 
Swedish for respectively a salmon and a dachshund, and the 
action of the play incorporates models of these two crea- 
tures, called Laximil and Taximil, as sense images of the two 
operations — and the action, it need hardly be said, shoots 
with the liveliest of ammunition over the target as thus 
defined, with its apparently harmless burlesquerie. Even so, 
we find here formulated a dialectical process central to 
Oyvind Fahlstrom's world of fantasy, his "imagination 
materielle" (that term of Bachelard's that is so supremely 
applicable in his case). The hardness, the distinction, the 
concretion of even that fantasy's most apparently whimsical 
creations have a consistency as of red-hot flowing magma 



that has been suddenly solidified in cold, and, hardly before 
it is set, exposed to aggressions, to forces seeking its inner 
erosion, deformation and dissolution. And the key words in 
the titles given to his two collections of poetry also suggest 
not only a development but also a dialectical process. On the 
one hand, the "table" (Swedish bordet = h [for betydelse, 
"meaning"] + ordet, "the word"), the intractable but solidly 
hewn, angular, hard, serviceable, movable object (and be- 
hind it the entire Fahlstromian dimension of dangerous, 
thorny, fantastically teeming everyday life). On the other, 
the borborygmus (medical Greek for stomach rumbling), 
the process that dissolves the hard and solid into sound, 
released energies and excrement, and dies. The tension— and 
exchangeability — between life and death is infinite and ever- 
present in Oyvind Fahlstrom, a constant, ongoing process of 
creation that is at the same time a destructive event.

slowly the whole of my head begins to speak 

to be able to float in chorus 

children are included in it without being at all tempted to restrain themselves 

around the horizon big gentle fights — small strangers, cicadas 

may I accompany you strings of children sweep past into the distance (do not

until one night they brake in warmed-up McCarthy pants, four portions in 
each and the platform sways 

crowned by a bottomless cave 

longer and longer between the shots 

warm receptionist hours hawk hour after hour 

until the cleft widens between the two child-Stakhanovites each on its tripod 

playing hawk and tern 

and the vaulted canopy of the showcase sinks dripping with beer and dung 

class upon class right down to the first preparatory boiling water on their laps 

in the twilight urgent throbs of love between hawk and tern with a spire for 

a tongue and 
recoiling from wild bites floats 
in honey which is slowly becoming lighter far away beyond the last twitching

O.F.: 

Notes on "ADE-LEDIC-NANDER II" (1955-57) &amp; 
some later developments 



The title is arbitrary; it is the name of a 
principle or property described in a sci- 
ence fiction short story by Van Vogt. I 
used it to denote the three-part system 
or universe on which the large series 
(some twenty paintings were projected 
in extensive notes) of which only the 
small "introductory" no. 1 and the 
large no. 2 were completed. It was sup- 
posed to become a vast epic of the indi- 
viduals, the "character-forms" in the 
three "clans" or "societies" ADE, 
LEDIC and NANDER. 

In no. 2 you actually mostly see the 
first of the three "families" or 
"societies": the ADEs — recognized by 
their vertical form; by the "point- 
antenna-stabilizer" on their top; by 
their prevailing cool colors (the indi- 
vidual "clans" are often denoted by 
combinations of color stripes); by the 
black triangle in their center with many 
or few white "grains" showing its state 
as "well-fed and powerful" or "weak" 
which in turn opens or curtails a num- 
ber of possibilities; by the "clawbeak" 
below on each individual character- 
form (it depends on a chunk of "ma- 
teria" of ADE to function); by the 
wires between the individuals; by the 
lightning-zigzag between the "power- 
energy" element and the black triangle. 
These and five— ten more conditions 
(game-rules) make the ADEs live, 
struggle, multiply, break down, ail, 
subjugate, freeze etc. as is exemplified 
all over the painting. 

In one place (the black "smoke" in 
the lower area of the painting) there 
is an isolated and threatened colony 
of roundish, reddish, centrally built 



LEDICs — one of which overtakes an 
ADE (near the largest complete circle 
to the right), most other ADEs in the 
area being dissolved into "phantom- 
forms," outhne-negative-forms, as 
they are not strong-healthy etc. enough 
to exist on the "barren" black back- 
ground. One of them, like many of the 
ADEs, has incorporated part of a 
LEDIC as a particulary valuable or- 
gan-slave-source-of-energy — this ADE 
finds its slave-organ developing 
dangerously now that it is close to its 
peers and eventually breaks the barriers 
and gets the better of its former exploi- 
ter. 

Etc. 

I made a detailed analysis-and-de- 
scription of the painting, when I 
finished it; it covers thirty typed pages, 
and two "topographical maps" — in 
Swedish — it consists entirely of matter- 
of-fact descriptions like these above. 

From above also follows 

— I'm mainly interested in "making 
paintings that are worlds by ma- 
nipulating the world" — hy creating 
and relating models of the world; 
not symbols— anyone may put in 
whatever he finds — only he sees 
(some of) the relations: what is like, 
unlike, repeated, juxtaposed etc., 
etc., 

— the overall image is centralized 
— you should not be able to grasp 
the painting, not even materially, in 
one look; 

— the structure is game-like — preset 
conditions as material for the 
plot — not surrealistic irrationality 
or neodadaistic "unrelationships" 



(Rauschenberg i.e.); elements bv 
decree of the painting, are tied up 
rather than cut off and isolated; 

— the plot is one of multiple variations 
within the space, which is thus 
broken up into time, phases of time, 
(and space); technique of primitive 
and epic art and of comic strips; 

— the outline (more than color and 
other formqualities) is of over- 
whelming importance, it is the basic 
form-criterion of the characterform; 
proportions, size etc. can be 
arranged for "decorative" purpose; 
outline, silhouette, never except of 
course for the purpose of the plot. 
All this in turn has to do with what 
I'm doing now, among other things: 

— worlds— my last extended work, the 
Planetarium, which I have been 
working on since late May, is the 
world of an interior monologue of a 
person — and the relations between 
words, figures (postures) and 
clothes. The next, The Cold War, 
will be a picture of balance, "false" 
or "real" balancing, of pairs of 
transformable elements on either 
side of a "neutral" channel, with its 
set of forms on strings. 

— decentralizing — ADE-LEDIC- 
NANDER 2 should if reproduced 
always be accompanied by repro- 
duction of detail. 

The factor of transformabihty in my 
newer things, from Sitting . . . Six 
months later, tends to much more 
powerfully than before stress the 
perception piece-by-piece, instant- 
by-instant; stressed also by comics' 
frame in the Sitting . . . picture.

— the gamerules — tend to be concen- 
trated in what is seen on the paint- 
ing, not in written complex condi- 
tions as in ADE-LEDIC-NAN- 
DER 2; this applies to the fewer, 
clearer, simpler properties-relations 
of the individuals, the character- 
forms, in the red, blue, violet, green, 
and the "auxiliary" white, black, 
and light yellow groups in Sit- 
ting . . ., in the transformable paint- 
ings are added purely material con- 
ditions: length of thread, magnet- 
ized or non-magnetized areas, fit- 
ting or not fitting outlines. 



variations — the ultimate concretiz- 
ing of this principle appears in 
the transformable paintings which 
never are one same picture; whose 
arrangement is given by me on the 
painting (variations almost indefi- 
nite— i.e. Planetarium 188 loose ele- 
ments) or usually on special panel 
with photographs or drawings of 
the variations, thus a kind of score, 
(add to gamerules: relations still 
arbitrary, rational or not— for in- 
stance in the Planetarium) all verbs 
relate to pants or skirt (loose, 
jointed forms to be arranged on fi- 



gure, adverbs to hats, caps, ban- 
dages, berets — etc.) 
the outline — the striking concretiza- 
tion, again materially, by means of 
cutting out silhouettes (character- 
forms or figurative forms), in vinyl 
plastic, painting them, jointing them 
with rivets or hinges, bending with 
heat, magnetizing with ferrite-mag- 
nets. Magnetism beginning to be for 
me what electricity is for Tinguely.

Carl Fredrik Reuters ward: 

At the "Sunday evenings" held in the and we never spoke to each other. It one more unlike myself. His dry- 
early fifties in Franqois Arnal's flat in emerged, subsequently, that his name knowledge rustled away like a German 
St. Germain-des-Pres there would was Fahlstrom, and that we lived a encyclopedia. Given his lack of spon- 
appear, on occasion, a lean, pale young stone's throw from each other in the taneity, his words could pour like 
man with huge, inward-looking eyes. 1 Old Town, in Stockholm. corrosive acid over his surroundings, 
assumed him to be a South American, Oyvind fascinated me: I knew no Everything, as it came into contact

with Oyvind's incantations, became 
decadent. Fate, and chance, were only 
permitted on his own strict terms. It 
you criticized the appearance of a par- 
ticular form, you were treated to 
exhaustive "Instructions for use," ex- 
plaining, with a wealth of circum- 
stance, not only the function of that 
particular form but also its genealogy. 

One evening, when he had moved to 
Rasunda, I went out to see him. On his 
workdesk lay a generously washed 
drawing. "Great," I said. "That one 
really swings." Oyvind turned as pale 
as was physically possible for him. A 
primitively thundering, unisonal roar 
rose from the nearby football stadium. 
"This picture is unacceptable," he re- 
marked, "I have just poured a cup of 
tea over it." But nor could he approve 
of the world, as it stood. The one Uto- 
pia and realizable social proposal of his 
was constantly succeeding the other. 

I learned from Oyvind that to "stand fifties. Twenty years later, just before such a public figure that he was con- 
outside" the world by no means im- his death, he told me that he, the No. 1 cerned to find his way back again, to a 
plied its rejection. That was in the mid- scourge of injustice, had now become hidden, but effective point of take-off.

Robert Rauschenberg: 

The logical or illogical relationship be- 
tween one thing and another is no 
longer a gratifying subject to the artist 
as the awareness grows that even in his 
most devastating or heroic moment he 
is part of the density of an uncensored 
continuum that neither begins with nor 
ends with any decision or action of his. 
I recognize the acceptance of this 
fact in the work of Fahlstrom whose 
characters in a plot of painting can take 
any shape, responding to the openly 
established dramatics of the picture 
map. They are free to operate, cooper- 
ate, incorporate, collide or collapse, 



always responding locally without a 
tasteful sense of the compositional four 
sides of the canvas, which seems to 
serve only as the sheet of paper needed 
to record any information. The tech- 
nique is what happens as well as hap- 
pening, supporting its own identity 
and individual quality, but remaining 
as vulnerable as the sign it defines. One 
can be aware in a painter like Fahl- 
strom of the probable frustration he 
experiences in not being able to extend 
the scale of his signs to invisibility and 
continue. The use of the familiar is 
obscure, the use of the exotic is fam- 



iliar. Neither sacrifices completely its 
origin, but the mind has to travel to 
follow just as the eye has to change to 
focus. In the end a viewed painting has 
been an invitation, not a command, but 
painted in such a way that it cannot be 
seen unless the rules of the concept are 
admitted. There is no separation be- 
tween the literal and literary. No com- 
petition exists between the physical 
character of the materials and the func- 
tion of the signs. Both remain lively 
impure.

Pontus Hulten: Fahlstrom in Wonderland 






Oyvind Fahlstrom's pictures represent 
a world built on moral concepts. Char- 
acters living in this world act in accord- 
ance with rules or break the rules. 
Fahlstrom is a man to whom questions 
of good and evil, right and wrong, are 
decisive. That someone in a given situ- 
ation is not following the rules, or is 
forced to do so, is to him extremely 
interesting. 

Fahlstrom creates in every picture a 
world of his own; he is simultaneously 
a capricious creator and evil execu- 
tioner, director, lawmaker, policeman. 
In these worlds live and die beings 
brought into existence by Fahlstrom's 
imagination, beings that struggle and 
love. They move and multiply, often 
entirely independent of each other, not 
only in space but also in time. Fahl- 
strom's pictures portray highly drama- 
tic situations; the most important fig- 



ures recur, are transformed by the 
events they are exposed to, and appear 
in new forms and disguises. 

Fahlstrom has developed this literary 
game of pictorial forms to the extreme. 
A wild, black, violent comedy is de- 
rived from the play of circumstances. 
What might happen, resembles, for in- 
stance, the scene that Carroll gives in 
Alice in Wonderland of the Queen's 
croquet lawn, where croquet is played 
with hedgehogs for balls and flamingos 
turned upside down for mallets: "The 
players all played at one time, without 
waiting for turns, quarrelling all the 
while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; 
and in a very short time the Queen was 
in a furious passion, and went stamping 
about and shouting: 'Off with his 
head!' or 'Off with her head!' about 
once a minute." The strong spatial and 
plastic effect that Fahlstrom's pictures 




possess is, to Fahlstrom, a secondary 
result. As can be discerned, Fahl- 
strom's work has gone through a slow, 
continuous development. Changes in 
his imagery are conditioned by the 
movement his world depicts; his art 
reflects a clear picture of the changes in 
his attitude towards life. In the fifties 
when Fahlstrom lived in Europe, his 
art was introspective, meditative, and 
reserved. Since his arrival in New York 
in 1961, his work tends to become 
more open and receptive, even directly 
engaged in political and social events. 
He makes use of the same method of 
description previously achieved. As 
early as 1958 he had begun to stock his 
pictures with figures composed of frag- 
ments from comic strips. In the United 
States, Fahlstrom adopts more and 
more ingredients of pop-culture. The 
mythology of comic strips, politics, 
television, and the record industry is 
transformed, absorbed and assimilated 
into his work. Apparently Fahlstrom is 
attracted also by the uncompromising 
moralism of the POP world. 

A striking mixture of pictorial, liter- 
ary, and mythological elements dis- 
tinguish Fahlstrom's art. He engages 
the media of modern science, politics 
and journalism in his art and employs 
them in his most recent work, as for 
example in Dr. Schweitzer's Last Mis- 
sion. Segments of this picture hang free 
in space and, as in some of his earlier 
two-dimensional pictures, may be fas- 
tened to each other with magnets. 
Painting has abandoned its place on the 
wall and becomes also theater, a game 
and psychodrama.

Billy Kluver: O.F. 



Oyvind Fahlstrom has lived for three 
years in New York, where he works in 
an artist's loft around the corner from 
Wall Street, down by the old docks. He 
had his first contact with the New 
York public with the showing of 
Sitting ... at the New Realist exhibition 
at the Sidney Janis Gallery in Novem- 
ber 1962. This extraordinary painting 
was again shown at his exhibition at the 
Cordier Ekstrom Gallery in January 
1964. Sitting . . . has the form of a dou- 
ble-page spread in a comic book and is 
based on a small collage of elements 
from comic strips; yet Fahlstrom does 
not make use of the comic strip as a 
means to determine the form of the 
painting, as does Roy Lichtenstein. 
The comic-strip elements are combined 
with groups of signs or character- 
forms which are the actors in a series of 
events which develop from frame to 
frame. In Ade-Ledic-Nander II (1957) 
which was also shown at the Cordier 
Ekstrom exhibition, the unity of the 
picture was already fragmented into 
events of the character-forms. The 
enormous multiplicity and the absence 
of evident order forces the spectator 
to understand the picture as a number 
of relationships or situations which 
(much like the pieces in a domino 
game) can be combined in different 
ways depending on how one travels in 
the picture. Fahlstrom wants to bring 
forth connections that act like the rules 



in a game on the basis of the situations 
in which the character-forms and the 
comic-strip elements occur. It is inher- 
ent in Fahlstrom's use of the sign that 
the figurative as well as non-figurative 
forms are accepted as equal in the same 
way as all materials and their meanings 
are accepted as valid by the Americans 
since Rauschenberg and Johns. These 
Cage-inspired artists are, however, 
opposed to the idea of creating connec- 
tions which Fahlstrom does deliberate- 
ly. The next step for Fahlstrom occurs 
in Sitting . . . Six months later, where he 
not only lets the combination and the 
construction of the different situations 
happen in the imagination of the spec- 
tator but also on the picture surface 
itself. He achieves this by making the 
signs and the figurative forms cutout 
and painted silhouettes which, by 
means of attached magnets, can be 
moved and placed on certain parts of 
the picture. There is now an increase in 
the number of degrees of freedom 
within which the spectator can change 
the appearance of the picture. Fahl- 
strom does not see any significant dif- 
ference between the physical interfer- 
ence of the spectator and the usual 
situation where the spectator trans- 
forms the picture only in his imagina- 
tion. In the large painting Planetarium 
the rules have been simplified so that 
the spectator can dress forty-two fi- 
gures, arranged in groups, with ninety- 



four magnetized garments. These gar- 
ments are all taken from actual gar- 
ments in comic strips and many of them 
have movable joints so that they can 
conform to the different positions of 
the figures. As in previous paintings 
one group of picture elements assigns 
roles to another group; in the painting 
based on the Krazy Kat comic strip 
every sign thus "acts" as a character in 
the comic strip. In the same way the 
garments give a variety of roles to the 
figures, and every garment in turn rep- 
resents a word (on a movable square in 
the corresponding color) in a conversa- 
tion which is transformed as the gar- 
ments are placed on different figures. 
Fahlstrom's last work, The Cold War, 
is a completely transformable painting. 
It consists of two large white surfaces 
where the magnetized elements can be 
attached at any place. The elements are 
figurative images or painted cutouts 
from comic strips. The initial rules for 
the transformations of the painting are 
given by the artist. The physicality of 
The Cold War, manifested by the sug- 
gestive choice of elements and the ease 
with which they can be moved, makes 
it an immediate and exciting painting. 
However, the complexity of the paint- 
ing is such that only an intensive search 
can reveal the rules according to which 
it can or should be played.

Erro: 



This spring I had breakfast in a diner 
called "Empire" on tenth Avenue. It 
was seven o'clock in the morning and 
New York is always very special in 
early morning. And I remembered the 
sixties, getting home from these loft 
parties. In my bed I started thinking of 
talks we had a long time ago about art, 
preserving artists to an old age, the 
concentration, the meditation or the 
privacy (silence) most of us need for 
working. Then all of that falls apart. As 
I remembered you working with the 
television on just in front of your 
working table and having a bamboo 
stick to turn off the sound when com- 



mercials were shown. I thought of Re- 
noir who continued painting for years 
after he was crippled by arthritis, the 
brush had to be strapped to his arm. 
Then Goya, who at the age of seventy- 
eight escaped the terror in Spain and 
ended up in Bordeaux. He was deaf 
and his eyes were failing. In order to be 
able to work he had to wear several 
pairs of glasses, one over another, and 
also used a magnifying glass. He was 
painting superb works in a new style. 

We discussed Rubens's factory in 
Antwerp and how the assistants, stu- 
dents and fellow artists, often worked 
on the same painting. Then you spoke 



about the privilege of being a painter, 
not having fixed working hours and 
being able to organize our time freely. 
Many of us find the solution very eas- 
ily but for you even mixing the colors 
took hours and nothing was ever easy. 

But somehow the results are always 
very exciting. And as you know you 
are one of my favourite painters. 

Now the spring is coming and I am 
sure I will find you on the corner of 
Seine and Rue de Buci like so often 
before. Or we could meet on the Green 
Hill which must be somewhere be- 
tween heaven and h . . .

Sitting . . . Six months later, Version A. 1962 

Variable painting with 18 movable elements, tempera on paper mounted on canvas, 

22Vi6 x 45%" (56 x 1 16.5 cm.) 

Collection Emil Soderstrom, Bromma 



O.F.: Manipulating The World 



In my variable pictures the emphasis 
on the "character" or "type" of an ele- 
ment is achieved materially by cutting 
out a silhouette in plastic and sheet 
iron. The type then becomes fixed and 
tangible, almost "live" as an object, yet 
flat as a painting. Equipped with mag- 
nets, these cutouts can be juxtaposed, 
superposed, inserted, suspended. They 
can slide along grooves, fold laterally 
through joints, and frontally through 
hinges. They can also be bent and riv- 
eted to permanent three-dimensional 
forms. 

These elements, while materially 
fixed, achieve their character-identity 



only when they are put together; their 
character changes with each new 
arrangement. The arrangement grows 
out of a combination of the rules (the 
chance factor) and my intentions, and 
is shown in a "score" or "scenario" (in 
the form of drawings, photographs or 
small paintings). The isolated elements 
are thus not paintings, but machinery 
to make paintings. Picture-organ. 

The finished picture stands some- 
where in the intersection of paintings, 
games (type Monopoly and war games) 
and puppet theater. 

Just as the cut-out materializes the 
types, the factor of time in painting 



becomes material through the many, in 
principle infinite, phases in which the 
elements will appear. As earlier, in my 
"world" pictures such as Ade-Ledic- 
Nander and Sitting ... a form would be 
painted on ten different places on the 
canvas, now it may be arranged in ten 
different ways during a period of time. 
The role of the spectator as a perfor- 
mer of the picture-game will become 
meaningful as soon as these works can 
be multiplied into a large number of 
replicas, so that anyone interested can 
have a picture machine in his home and 
"manipulate the world" according to 
either his or my choices. 1964

O.F.: After Happenings 



In the fifties I wrote a few stage plays 
and the scripts of a radio play and a TV 
film. I was attempting in these plays to 
organize the plot as a game structure: 
the more or less irrational plot ele- 
ments and situation presented in the 
first scene determined, or could be seen 
as "rules" for, everything that was 
going to happen in the scenes that fol- 
lowed. 

In 1961, before I went to the USA, I 
was planning a "musical theater" pro- 
duction with Fylkingen, a project 
which was realized the following year 
with Aida (if realized is the right word, 
when one thinks of the incoherent pro- 
duction). 

I was impressed then as I was again 
later by what I saw in New York, but 
the methods of our fellow-creators of 
Happenings in America in making a 
theatrical event out of the act of paint- 
ing were not on the whole what I was 
interested in. On the other hand I have 
found many points of contact with the 
new dramatic dance which has grown 
up in New York over the last two 
years: Rainer, Morris, Rauschenberg, 
Hay, Childs. 

In Aida and Birds in Sweden, and in 
1964 in Beer and Fahlstrom's Corner, 
and this year in the "sound film" for 
radio Holy Torsten Nilsson, I was 
trying to find a form which had the 
irrational juxtapositions of music and 
melodrama found in opera; the rhyth- 
mic processional order of Mystery 
plays or initiation ceremonies with 



Babies for Africa. 1963

their sudden unexplained cathartic 
"revelations"; and the topicality, the 
focus on personality and the repeated 
switching from idol to supporting cast 
to entranced audience in revues and TV 
variety shows. 

In the performances, I devised sound 
and music more than visual elements; 
worked more with illusion (projection, 
textual reference, gestures) than with 
tangible matter; with a complicated 
overall form and kaleidoscopic profu- 
sion of motifs. I also had ideas about 
manipulating people (identities, para- 
psychology), manipulating events (the 
same events subjected to various dif- 
ferent actions: continuity, sequence, 
tempo), and manipulating the audi- 
ence (mass-suggestion, indirect partici- 
pation). At the same time I wanted to 
use present-day real events and people 
as "independent" living material, with- 
out tendentious purpose: Thalidomide 
children, the Swedish Crown Prince, 



Yves Klein, alcohol licensing laws, 
the Tingsten-Lagercrantz controversy, 
Tjorven, Ingrid Thulin, Rodius, Carlo 
Derkert, the Top Ten, Swedish politi- 
cians, etc. 

The most striking impression I had 
from New York was: enterprise! That 
one could get something going oneself, 
instead of waiting to be taken up by the 
theater. Getting started on various 
forms of primitive theater work also 
meant that I was becoming a man of 
action after years of sedentary painting, 
introverted isolation. And the addi- 
tional satisfaction of appearing in per- 
son myself, if only on a very modest 
scale. But the disadvantages are im- 
mense: the huge outlay of time needed 
to achieve a single performance of pre- 
dress-rehearsal standard. 

Of course we do not now have any 
choice. "Fringe theater" in all its forms 
has clearly only just begun to exploit 
its possibilities. Nevertheless it will

probably start gradually satisfying 
other needs rather than presenting 
first-class productions of important 
radical plays. That function will be 
taken over by established institutions 
as they are gradually infiltrated by the 
techniques and styles, the aesthetics 
and philosophy of life, that are fun- 
damental to the Happening phe- 
nomenon. I am thinking primarily of 
theater and film. But even the revital- 
ization of opera, or its replacement, 
may have a part to play. What up to 
now has been an "uncomfortable" 
combination of music and action will 
now be a strength, a tempting eldorado 
for poetry and madness! The supreme 
feeling of bliss when music and action 
merge and together raise the climax to 
another level. I have tried to attain a 
renewal of that technique in Birds in 
Sweden, Aida and Fahlstrom's Corner. 
At the same time, opera demonstrates 
the "amorality" of art, its readiness to 
profit from and transform into art any- 
thing at all to stimulate and broaden 
our self-awareness: torture accompa- 
nied by be! canto in Tosca. (Self-aware- 
ness which in turn can or need not be 
made to serve a political end.) But we 
need not confine ourselves to musical 
drama to play with contradictions. In- 
deed, Peter Brook has described 
Shakespeare's works as a "theater of 
inconsistency," and his era as an un- 
rivalled background for that kind of 
theater. Since then there has certainly 
never been such a period as the present, 
when the theater has spread over such 
wide fields, and when it should thus 
itself be able to reap the benefits of that 
diversification. 

It must be acceptable for instance to 
deal with what seems important and 
topical without having to conform 
to Brecht's shrewd, didactic world, 
however expertly devised that may be; 
to create drama that concerns itself with 




Claes Oldenburg: 

Photos from Nekropolis II in 1962, 
when Oyvind played one of the "rela- 
tives" along with Irene Fornes (the 
playwright), Mariola Moyano, Milet 
Andreyevich (a painter), Lucas Sama- 
ras et al. Each "relative" spoke a diffe- 
rent language at the table, and Oyvind 



unfolded a huge map of the universe. 
Much of the action took place in ex- 
treme slow motion and it ended with 
the "relatives" covering their faces 
with aluminum foil. Later they were 
involved in a fight with "bears" and it 
all ended in destruction ....

the present-day world, but is entirely 
unfettered by rational argument. Just 
as in the game-poem Memorandum 
and in my game-and-puppet-theater 
paintings I deal with the universe, with 
nuclear arsenals, with war in East Asia, 
and so on, as significant facts, and as 
specific manifestations on whose "im- 
mutable" form I can have an opi- 
nion—so, in the same way, I must be 
able to write about, let us say, Utopian 
models of society, Swedish politicians, 
or an O.F. Happening in Peking (as I 
did in Holy Torsten Nilsson), without 
being a debater, reporter, psychologist 
or moralist. There does not even need 
to be a contradiction in starting from 
the basis of a value-judgement, that is 
to say both presenting a partisan 
documentary and also exploiting in ev- 
ery way the theatrical qualities inherent 
in the events depicted. 

A purely documentary presentation 
of events is obviously only one 
method, and one of the least important 
methods, of presenting one's material. 
Nor is there any contradiction— nor 
any descent into "irresponsible 
games" — if events are re- worked, dis- 
torted, changed beyond all recognition. 
The artist is not answerable to events, 
but only to himself as an artist. Thus I 
need not be afraid, for instance, of 
using the exact words of answers given 
in an American radio interview with a 
man who had had a sex-change opera- 
tion, or of letting the female inter- 
viewer utter a high-pitched melisma 
instead of— and for exactly the same 
length of time as— what she actually 
said. (This happens in the one-act play 
Christmas 1965 — The Brothers Strind- 
berg—Two Interviews, published in 
Dialog, no. 1. This is also an example 
of how plot and music can be com- 
bined.) 

A more complicated intervention is, 
for example, allowing a scene from 



Strindberg's To Damascus to infiltrate 
every vicissitude in a poor French- 
woman's life. (The Brothers Strind- 
berg)} 

Material which is important for life 
can be found everywhere and is recog- 
nizable by its uncorrupted nature. 
Many phenomena have been corrupted 
by being used so often for demagogic, 
didactic, aesthetic or satirical purposes. 

The tragic element in the situation of 
the Stranger in Strindberg's To Damas- 
cus is the contrived, hothouse misery of 
literature (no less intensely felt for 
that). The Frenchwoman's misfortunes 
(in The Brothers Stnndberg) are the 
raw unresilient misfortunes with which 
one is inflicted: destitution, slave- 
labor, illness, violence, loneliness. 
Hence my juxtaposition. Or Ham- 
marskjold— Greta Garbo and the pen- 
sioner couple in Hammarskjold on 
God. 

The paralytic in literature is certainly 
haunting when, as in Beckett's works, 
he withers away in a drooling limbo; 
the paralytic in life is someone who has 
to have the excrement extracted from 
his bowels every week. Drama nowa- 
days is full of the exploration of neuro- 
tic identifications and role-fixations, 
but in life there are those (as in the 
above-mentioned case of sex-change) 
for whom neurotic role-awareness be- 
comes a matter of heartrending se- 
riousness, and is turned into living rea- 
lity. 

The juxtapositions of life/art, event/ 
intervention, fact/delirious inspiration, 
mean something totally different from 
"collage," "anything goes with any- 
thing," and the like. They are very rare 
finds, they are more like what Koest- 
ler in his new book calls "bi- 
sociation" — when one has an element A 
and finds an element B, and there is a 
violent spark when one rubs A against 
B! That is to say that the result is com- 



pletely different from and much greater 
than the sum of the two parts. Thus for 
me the fascination of Weiss's Marat 
play resides in a double bisociation: 
the French Revolution and the mental 
asylum of Charenton in the early 
nineteenth century — and Marat and the 
Marquis de Sade. 

In Aida I make Bengt Emil Johnson, 
identified by a projector image as "Bo 
Nilsson," play on Vivvi Roos, desig- 
nated as a "cello." Then I have also got 
something resilient, a springboard, 
something which delimits and provides 
new ideas. There is nothing arbitrary 
about the "music" emanating from the 
girl as cello: shrieks, droning, colora- 
tura, grunts, humming, etc., depending 
on what parts of her and how hard he 
strokes. Eroticism and drama, music 
and plot, have been bisociated. Rules 
have been drawn up and a game (the 
indeterminate against the necessary) 
has been evolved. 

At the end of my poem-for-radio 
Birds in Sweden, I "translate" (imitate) 
the rhymes from Poe's The Raven by 
groups of onomatopoetic words from 
American comics. These in their turn 
take on the pattern of a game: they are 
"translated" back into the (real) sounds 
they represent. 

All kinds of patterns which obtrude 
themselves from the outside world are 
useful as stimuli to break out of the 
closed circles of subjectivity. Not just 
occurrences in life: it has long been my 
dream to be able to make use of a film 
production — a Swedish film of country 
life, an Italian historical-mythological 
color production — so that when set- 
ting, scenery, actors, costumes, tech- 
nical equipment are already there, they 
can all be exploited; even dialogue and 
elements of the plot. With only small, 
superficial changes, one would be able 
to get (and very cheaply too) not only 
Elvira Madigan, but a Para-£7wra 



49 



Madigan, not only Son of Hercules, 
but a Son of Hercules on Burroughs's 
level of confusion and madness. And 
long, empty mumbling, and meditative 
sections, where everything would be 
treated as immense expanses of 
snow — hardly any sound .... 

It is not of paramount importance 
whether one should prefer a prosce- 
nium stage, with apron stage, theater- 
in-the-round, or large undefined 
rooms. With the aid of illusion, any- 
thing can be staged anywhere. There is, 
of course, no contradiction between 
illusion and reality; there is no reality 
which is not illusory, no illusion which 
is not reality. So there is something 
pointless about metatheater, theater 
within theater, theater about theater. 
Kenneth Brown's The Brig, with its 
"illusion" carried to the extreme, 



appears innovative and daring, while 
the Chinese boxes in Gelber's Connec- 
tion and The Apple are good old 
(Pirandello) tradition. 

Nor do we need to fight shy of 
words, as in most Happenings and 
"musical theater." Artaud's hostility 
towards words can be understood 
against the background of the drama of 
the time, but the situation is different 
in 1965. On the one hand there are the 
possibilities of conveying or exactly 
imitating real speech: taped interviews, 
one's neighbor's conversation recorded 
by means of a hidden directional mic- 
rophone (Holy Torsten Nilsson). On 
the other hand there are the possibili- 
ties of emphasizing — by the stimulating 
use of repetition, redistribution, ex- 
traction, distortion: the BBC's in- 
comparable Goon Shows ....

"Fractured psychology": characters 
can change personality, abruptly or im- 
perceptibly, assume "wrong" charac- 
teristics, qualities, etc. Characters' 
"thoughts," free associations, etc., can 
be expressed or played on tape parallel 
with the direct dialogue. The to-and- 
fro responses of the theater of con- 
versation miss, collide, chase one 
another, in violent changes of tempo, 
shifting towards action, towards "frac- 
tured" movement. The whole designed 
"unnaturally" to present and be a 
sequence of actions, not to document a 
stream of consciousness or the like. 

Thus the scepticism of fringe theater 
towards the actor is redundant— only 
when rhythm, illusion, virtuosity, and 
exaggeration are prerequisites, if at all, 
will the implementation of a theatrical 
idea stand and fall with the actor. 

This does not mean that theater 
should be limited only to its present 
institutions and scope. A theater in- 
spired by Happenings which could en- 
terprisingly and demagogically touch 
on sensitive areas — with alternating ex- 
ceptionally "foolish," exceptionally 
"beautiful," and exceptionally "repug- 
nant" sections, or similarly alternating 
reformulations of the same section 
— this kind of theater could become a 
political factor if it were made for and 
toured in Russia, China or Africa. 

TV games could be changed to a 
mixture of game and psychodrama, 
with actors and personalities and people 
from the audience: "Living Mono- 
poly." (Last spring I performed a little 
sketch in New York, playing various 
roles, in which, as Hitler, blindfolded, 
I stretched out an enormously elon- 
gated tongue until it touched a member 
of the audience, who was thus selected 
as Mrs. Hitler.) 

Or on Swedish television we could 
regularly have worn-out politicians and 
civil servants dressed in Stockholm

Municipal Theater's Winme-tbe-Pooh 
costumes, changing clothes from time 
to time and giving truthful (apolitical) 
answers to questions from the public. 

The other line that could be followed 
is that of pure theater. There we should 
cultivate: the effect of wholeness, mys- 
tery, delirium, the theater of happiness. 
Isolate and act out those dizzy mo- 
ments when the self is exposed to 
the strongest sensation of life. Some- 
thing which cannot be directly de- 



scribed—theater which is like the 
mighty vortex of Xenakis' string glis- 
sandi, or the aria in Cavalleria Rustica- 
na piling piercing sobs one upon the 
other; the split-second movements 
(like magic tricks) in Lucinda Childs's 
Carnation Dance; the glimpse of nir- 
vana when Truffaut in Jules et Jim cuts 
to a flight over a wooded mountain; 
the lightning, the dialogue and the re- 
sounding of the thunder-machine in 
Strindberg's To Damascus, Part II; the 



mellifluous swing music in the pro- 
logue to Goldfinger; the deep heartbeat 
of the Supremes; the upsurge when 
consciousness hits the bottom on an 
LSD trip. 1965 

1 Or letting the plot in a Swedish popular com- 
edy The Hammarby Gang, "program" the coup 
attempt against Hitler by the 20th July group; or 
using dialogues from old gangster and horror 
films to "interpret" the murder of Kennedy, as in 
two later plays, Pardon, Hitler (1968) and 
Oswald Comes Back (1967).

O.F.: 

Games — from "Sausages and Tweezers — A Running Commentary." 



A game in its most universal meaning 
requires only one thing: rules. A player 
at a slot machine can be a single person; 
two competing; twenty competing; or 
twenty playing individually. 

My basic interpretation of the con- 
cept of a game— and my artistic use of 
it — is therefore not evolved from the 
strategy theories of Neumann, Herman 
Kahn, etc. I am more inclined to refer 
to Cage's method of composition, and 
psychologists such as T. Leary and E. 
Berne. But above all, the idea of a game 
for me is a simple, fundamental out- 
look on life, dating back to the time of 
my Concrete Manifesto (1953). 

The most basic "rules" are the im- 
mutability of the magnetic objects in 



terms of color, size, shape, collaps- 
ibility and so on, together with their 
implied open meaning. Less exact rules 
apply, as in The Cold War, when for 
instance the objects consist of pairs, or 
companion pieces — what I do with A 
has significance for A', wherever A 1 is 
located. (Model for balance of terror.) 

Also in some of the paintings, The 
Planetarium, Dr. Schweitzer's Last 
Mission, Switchboard, Sitting . . ., 
Dominoes, Roulette, etc., there are 
rudimentary rules (of the jigsaw puzzle 
type) which in their turn contravene 
the rules of the magnetic objects' in- 
vanables and the player's variables. 

The fundamental principle for game- 
paintings, however, is the confron-

tation between freedom of variation and 
the arbitrary immutability of appear- 
ance, substance and construction. 
Hence my interest in signs, i.e. type- 
faces, and in objects as shapes. 

Whatever might go on elsewhere, 
in the many-thousand-year here-and- 
now of this planet, the appearance of a 
hand is immutably something jointed, 
flat, with five extended parts. Not a 
sphere. As well as being less interested 
in nuances and ambiguity when applied 
to matters concerning life, I am equally 
unconcerned about whether some 
hands have four fingers, or whether 
some hands are larger and others smal- 
ler. 

The decisive factor is that I as an 
"artist," and I and others as "human 
beings," are at every moment of our 
lives coming up against what we see as 
the absolute rigidity of appearances, 
and adjusting our own variation-possi- 
bilities accordingly. There is here a 
fundamental and inexhaustible tension. 

Without manipulating works of art 
one can hardly realize the fantastic 
range of the astronomical freedom of 
choice and the immense rigidity in the 
external appearance of the parts — and 
in the material they are made of: the 
combination of metal and plastic makes 
shapes as strong as axes. 

Then after that fundamental fact 
comes the fragile rigidity of the other 
rules — like our conventions and agree- 
ments: the border between the Congo 
and Angola, the numbers in the tele- 
phone book, the buttoning of jackets. 
The tension lies in the fact that it is 
possible to oppose the rigidity — just as 
it is in my models.

O.F.: Take Care of the world 



1. Art. Consider art as a way of ex- 
periencing a fusion of "pleasure" and 
"insight." Reach this by impurity, or 
multiplicity of levels, rather than by 
reduction. (The fallacy of some paint- 
ing, music, etc.; satori by mere reduc- 
tion. The fewer the factors, the more 
they have to be "right," "ultimate.") 

The importance of bisociation 
(Koestler). In paintings, factual images 
of erotic or political character, for 
example, bisociated, within a game- 
framework, with each other and/or 



Crown Prince burning himself as a 
Buddhist monk. An interview with a 
sex-change case in both documentary 
and pure sound (yells). 

Ultimately, the goal will be to reach 
"The un-natural." 

2. Games. Seen either as realistic mod- 
els (not descriptions) of a life-span, of 
the Cold War balance, of the double- 
code mechanism to push the bomb 
button — or as freely invented rule- 
structures. Thus it becomes important 



with "abstract" elements (character- 
forms) will not exclude but may incite 
to "meditational" experiences. These, 
in turn, do not exclude probing on 
everyday moral, social levels. 

This would equally hold true for the 
theater. In two short plays of mine, 
The Brothers Strindberg and Ham- 
marskjold on God, performed in Stock- 
holm, dance-like "pure" sequences are 
interlocked with an actual interview 
with an aged couple on the cost of liv- 
ing and a representation of the Swedish

ESSO-LSD. 1967

Edition of 5 

Collection Mr. and Mrs. William H. Wise, Palm Springs, California 



to stress relations (as opposed to "free 
form" where everything can be related 
to anything so that in principle nothing 
is related). The necessity of repetition 
to show that a rule functions — thus the 
value of space-temporal form and of 
variable form. The thrill of tension and 
resolution, of having both conflict and 
non-conflict (as opposed to "free 
form" where in principle everything is 
equal). 

Any concept or quality can be a rule, 
an invariable. The high notes or yells of 
the sex-change interviewer in The 
Brothers Strindberg [see section 1 
above], replacing and cued to the exact 
length of her questions, constitute a 
rule, as well as the form-qualities of a 
painted, magnetized metal cutout. The 
cutout is an invariable as form, out- 
look. As long as another element is not 
superimposed on it the cutout will nev- 
er vary visually but its meaning will 
vary depending on its position. Rules 
oppose and derail subjectivity, loosen 
the imprinted circuits of the individual. 

3. Multiples. Painting, sculpture, etc., 
today represent the most archaic art 
medium, depending on feudal patrons 
who pay exorbitantly for uniqueness 
and fetish magic: the "spirit" of the 
artist as manifested in the traces of his 



brushwork or at least in his signature 
(Yves Klein selling air against a signed 
receipt in 1958). 

It is time to incorporate advances in 
technology to create mass-produced 
works of art, obtainable by rich or not 
rich. Works where the artist puts as 
much quality into the conception and 
the manufacturer as much quality into 
the production, as found in the best 
handmade works of art. The value of 
variable form: you will never have 
exactly the same piece as your neigh- 
bor. I would like to design an extensive 
series of puppet games, sold by sub- 
scription, in cutout sheets; or 3-D dolls 
(BARBIES FOR BURROUGHS pro- 
ject). And robot theater: elements 
arrange themselves by computer pro- 
gramming. 

4. Style. If bisociation and games are 
essential, style is not. Whether a paint- 
ing is made in a painterly, in a hard- 
edge graphic or in a soft photographic 
manner is of secondary interest, just 
as documentary, melodramatic and 
dancelike dimensions can interweave in 
a play. I am not much involved in for- 
mal balance, "composition" or, in 
general, art that results in mere decora- 
tive coolness (art that functions pri- 
marily as rugs, upholstery, wallpaper). 



Nor am I concerned with any local 
cute Pop or camp qualities per se, be 
they the thirties, comics, Hollywood, 
Americana, Parisiana, Scandinavian- 
isms. 

5. Essentials. In order to seem essen- 
tial to me, a material, content or prin- 
ciple does not only have to attract me 
"emotionally," but should concern 
matters that are common and fun- 
damental to people in our time, and yet 
be as "fresh," as untainted by symbol- 
ism, as possible. I deplore my inca- 
pacity to find out what is going on. To 
find out what life, the world, is about, 
in the confusion of propaganda, 
communications, language, time, etc. 

Among the things I am curious 
about just now: where to find (and 
make a film of) the life geniuses, indi- 
viduals who manage to put the highest 
degree of artistry (creativity, happi- 
ness, self-fulfillment) in every phase of 
their living. What are the relations and 
possibilities in art-and-technology, new 
media? Chemical/electrical brain stimu- 
lation and ESP. Opera-theater-happen- 
mgs-dance. Europe-Russia (? China); 
isolate and incite the USA. Concerts 
(dance, music, lectures, etc. of the 
Cage-Rauschenberg type) in Russia. 
"Political" performances in China— the 
nonparadox of presenting the official 
outlook with the aesthetic conventions 
of New York performances, and vice 
versa. 

6. Risk reforms. Attitude to society: 
not to take any of the existing systems 
for granted (capitalist, moderately 
socialized or thoroughly socialized). 
Refuse to presume that "sharpness" of 
the opposite systems will mellow into a 
worthwhile in-between. Discuss and 
otherwise influence the authorities to- 
wards trying out certain new concepts. 

The reforms mentioned below are of

Mao-Hope-March. New York, 1966 

Filmed portion of performance, Kisses Sweeter than Wine, with passersby answering the question, "Are you happy?' 

O.F. seen on left with placard of Hope 



course not proposed with the huge, 
rigid warfare states like China, Russia 
or the USA in mind, but rather small 
welfare states like Sweden, groping for 
goals. The reforms are all more or less 
risky — which should be considered an 
asset; they will appear not as another 
series of regulations, but as events that 
might somewhat shake the chronic 
boredom of well-fed aimlessness and 



shove the country in question into in- 
ternational prominence. 

7. Arms. Complete and unilateral dis- 
armament (apart from a small perma- 
nent force submitted to the United Na- 
tions). Small countries will soon have 
to make the choice between this and 
acquiring nuclear weaponry anyway. 
The risk of disarming is minimal, as 



only other small countries now (or 
even later with nuclear arms) can be 
deterred. This step would, among 
other things, release tax-income, man- 
and brainpower for other reforms. 

8. Terror. Instead of prisons, create 
forcibly secluded, but large very com- 
plete (both sexes) and very "good" 
communities (everyday Clubs Medi- 



66 



terranes) where offenders could gra- 
dually find satisfying ways of living 
without offending society. The risk 
would of course be the suffering of 
victims, with potential offenders no 
longer deterred (a "Tenth Victim" 
situation?). 

Value is having to find out what 
makes a "good" community; corralling 
the discontented part of the popula- 
tion; finding out if punishment deters; 
finding out if a ma]or part of the 
population will turn criminal in order 
to be taken care of in a closed com- 
munity rather than live in the open 
one. 

9. Utilities. Free basic food, trans- 
portation and housing paid through 
taxes. Risk: "No one will care to 
work." Value: true equality — everyone 
paying taxes according to what he or 
she earns. As opposed to the present 
token equality, where an apple costs 
differently to each buyer. 

10. Profits. Steer away from redun- 
dant, self-revolving production (five to 
ten different companies producing the 
same detergent— competition mainly 
on the level of marketing gimmicks) by 
letting government agencies assign pro- 
jects to the two or three most qualified 
bidders (like military contracts plus 
limited competition). What to be pro- 
duced thus will be decided centrally by 
the country; how to produce, by the 
manufacturer; and how to divide the 
profits, by manufacturers and workers. 
An attempt to combine planning and 
incentive. The risk of less variety and 
lack of incentive outweighed by the 
chance to diminish the alienation in 
ordinary blindfolded work; of replac- 
ing publicity with information; and 
primarily to divert brain- and man- 
power to neglected fields like housing, 
pleasure, education, etc. 



11. Politics. Government by experts 
and administrators. Delegate the shap- 
ing of policies and the control of ex- 
perts to a body of "jurors" replaced 
automatically at given intervals, chosen 
from outstanding persons in all fields. 
Abolish politicians, parties, voting. 
Perhaps have referendums. Voting and 
active participation on regional, labor 
and such levels where participation is 
concrete and comprehensible. 

Find and channel some geniuses into 
creative administrative and diplomatic 
work, instead of excluding them from 
such leadership. Risk: nothing can be 
worse than the power games on local 
and global levels between smalltime 
politicians whose sole expertise lies in 
acquiring and keeping power. 

12. Pleasure. "The ecstatic society." 
Research and planning in order to de- 
velop and mass produce "art" as well 
as "entertainment" and drugs for grea- 
ter sensory experiences and ego-in- 
sight. New concepts for concert, thea- 



ter and exhibition buildings; but first 
of all pleasure houses for meditation, 
dance, fun, games and sexual relations 
(cf. the "psychedelic discotheque" on 
the West Coast, and the multiscreen 
discotheques of Murray the K and 
Andy Warhol). Utilize teleprinter, 
closed-circuit TV, computers, etc., to 
arrange contacts, sexual and other. 

Incite to creative living, but also 
approve "passive" pleasures by means 
of new drugs — good drugs, i.e. strong 
and harmless, instead of perpetuating 
the use of our clumsy, inherited drugs, 
liquors, stimulants. Refine the acti- 
vating (consciousness-expanding) new 
drugs. And develop euthanasia drugs 
to make dying easy, fast and irrevoc- 
able for terminal cases and prospective 
suiciders. 

The risk of people not caring to 
work any more would be eliminated by 
the fact that people would have super- 
ficial benefits attractive enough to 
make it worthwhile to work in order to 

obtain them.

Wine for "Nine Evenings: Theater and 
Engineering" at 26th Street Armory in 
New York. 1966. Photo: Peter Moore 



O.F.: From 
Kisses Sweeter 
than Wine 

While public gathers: 
Half house lights. Test-images. On 
Slide-screen: left panel of yellow bam- 
boo-organ (from O.F.'s painting Dr. 
Schweitzer's Last Mission). On movie 
screen: film in black and white show- 
ing central panel of bamboo organ. On 
TV screen: right panel of organ (filmed 
in "rear TV-area." 

(Film is partly picked up by glass 
sheet.) 

On white field, a 27 x 27 ft. carpet of 
cotton unrolled and pasted to canvas, 
referred to as "snowfield," eight per- 
formers are lying motionless, "invis- 
ible," covered with cotton. In the 
middle of the snowfield stands a screen. 
Behind it are concealed Soren Brunes 
and a lifelike dummy in frogman outfit, 
including goggles, gloves, fins, sitting 
on chair. 




Part 1. Frogman 

Lights lowered. Projections out. Performers discreetly blow 
soap bubbles. 

Film: whirling snow (filmed with rotating camera). Pro- 
jected through green filter. 

Soren removes screen. Frogman moves arms as if floating 
(arms pulled marionette-wise from behind screen). 

Soren shoots arrows against Frogman's head, one arrow 
penetrates and remains in head — in that moment: 

Tape: 1/4 bar of rock-rhythm, voice snaps: "Ha!" 1/4 bar 
rhythm (2-second fragment of Nancy Sinatra, "Boots"). 



After 10 — 30 seconds white foam plastic, polyurethane, con- 
cealed in head of dummy (mixed by Soren while behind 
screen): starts flowing over Frogman's head, white soggy 
mass. 

Tape (when overflow starts): "Kisses Sweeter than Wine," 
New Chnstv Minstrels (folk-rock, sweet-slick-beautiful, 
starts with whistling sequence; plus humming; plus re- 
frain "Kisses . . .," 40 seconds in all). 

Soren back, has surgeon's green rubber gloves - unhooks 
Frogman's arm, takes off stiffened white mass (and hooks 
onto thread attached to dummy's leg) - pulled in wire 
behind screen Frogman suddenly falls off chair and slow- 



68 



ly rises in the air, white mass "rising" with Frogman - 
while helium-inflated soap-bubble conglomerations rise 
equally slowly, like shimmering twirling short caterpil- 
lars, followed by spotlight. 
Tape (until dummy and bubble forms disappear in the dark- 
ness up at the very high ceiling) - fragment of interview 
with dope addict, man with pseudonym "St. Philomena" 
(drowsy voice): "... it attracts me - but - eh ... - but it 

doesn't satisfy me when I'm on a drug if you can 

comprehend - that sort of . . . well eh well - when, 

when I'm clean and I see people engrossed in the simplic- 
ity of - eh - their - interfamilial relations - ah - the simple 
give-and-take eh - the - in - of a father teaching his 
three-year-old son how to swim - and - eh a mother 
showing her daughter how to comb her hair and to make 
it look pretty - and so on - really - deriving satisfaction 
from this - I - oh, I hunger for that sort of thing - eh - 
with that relationship with anyone - and - yet - it bores 
me, and it - it — frightens me in a way - I hate myself for 
liking it, because there are so many important things to do 
- and here I am yearning for something that simple . . ." - 
Interviewer (Charlie Hayden): "I understand that the 
important thing - that you are quite a follower of the arts 
-." - St. Philomena: "ah the arts / - / sh my heart, the 
arts, look - the arts mean dort to me - eh - it's — it's the 
Lord - ah, it's the spirit - the spirit has given me a task to 
accomplish and I will use any means at my disposal to 
avoid doing my duty to the spirit - I'll drag my heels - I'll 
spit in the Lord's eye - cut my wrists - anything, anything 
and every to keep from sitting down and facing who and 
what I am and my surroundings, When I'm clean." 

Lights lowerd / Tape: O.F. in telephone conversation with 
British trade Commission in Shanghai, questions about 
weather. O.F. was unable to reach party in Shanghai./ 

Part 2. Buxton, Demonstrators, Johnson-head 

Slide: "Jedediah Buxton, born 1707, never learned to write 
or to do arithmetic, but he would carry complicated 
mathematical calculations in his head for as long as two 
and a half months, before coming up with the correct 
answer." 

TV- : Buxton-Rauschenberg, sitting straight up in chair in 
18th century costume, with wig. 

O.F. (over P. A. system): "Jedediah Buxton." 

Buxton: "Yes." 

O.F.: I want you to listen carefully to these numbers and we 



will see if you remember them later on when I ask you for 
them - they are - sales: 11,471,529 and net profit: 
1,035,675; sales: 2,471,988, net profit 219,272; sales: 
2,442,453, profit 391,225." 

Slide: same numbers, plus listing of companies: Standard Oil 
(N.J.), S.O. (Ind.), S.O. (Cal.). 

Slides: Esso-billboards and other ads showing Esso-tigers: 
American style, German Style, Swedish, Italian. 

Buxton (from TV screen, he sits behind movie screen, not 
seen by public) looks down at public, motionless. 

TV watcher comes in with chair, goes to TV set close to TV 
screen, turns on picture (no sound), sits back on chair, 
looking at TV-set picture (small as dot compared to the 
huge TV-projection screen). Hand in crotch, discretely 
masturbates (from now on). At that point: Tape: "Ha!" 
(same Nancy Sinatra fragment). 

Tilm: fragment of documentary, in color, showing solar 
eruptions glowing red bursts, flames, from segment of 
black disk, the sun. 

The people lying on "snowfield" rise, uncover picket signs 
consisting of large photo blowups, six showing Bob 
Hope's head, one Mao Tse Tung's - film partly projects 
on signs. They struggle to the left, as in storm winds. 

While Demonstrators struggle out: enters Invisible Man, 
wrapped in smoke (clothes soaked with titanium tetra- 
chloride). 

Tape - soundtrack from horror movie, storm, winds, sub- 
dued mood music. Groaning voice (monster?). Man's 
voice, distant, receding in fury of storm: "Johnson!! - 
Johnson!!" Fragment repeated. 

Tape: bass drum roll. 

Slide (in color): Indonesian Silawangi Soldier, drummer with 

bass drum, his back and head covered with hide and head 

of tiger, open mouth, fangs. 

Invisible Man starts unfolding slowly rotating a 2 ft. high 
package, or bandaged object, standing in the middle of the 
"snowfield." 

Slide (in color): man's shaved head, with grid of blue lines 
drawn on scroll. 

Tape (heard from receiver with loudspeaker behind pack- 
age): British spiritualists, 4-5 voices, man and women, 
more or less heavy Cockney accent: "falling asleep and 
waking up in a wonderful country, I think death is won- 
derful." — "In death one starts to really live." — "It is 
the passing on of our spirit into another world, and going 
along, eh, travelling along until you get to perfection — ."

ing to the rules written on the paint- 
ings, as variants of the classical 
Monopoly game, which is of course 
the game of capitalism: a simplified, 
but precise presentation of the trading 
of surplus value for capital gains. 
The Monopoly paintings are even 



more simplifed — as they deal with very 
complex realities — but nevertheless 
come out as basic game-diagrams of 
these phenomena. That is, by the way 
the surface is planned, by the formu- 
lation of the rules, the definition of 
resources (million dollar coins, or 
hearts = lives), tactics and other such 
elements, plus the additional informa- 
tion you get from the sectors of the 
CHANCE-wheel. Blue colors stand 
for USA, violet for Europe, red for 
Russia, yellow for China, orange for 
North Vietnam, etc., and the Third 



World goes from brown red, over 
shades of green, to green blue (S. Viet- 
nam, S. Korea, etc.). 

By chosing sides and strategies the 
plaver will be involved in a miniature 
political psychodrama. The game can 
be played intensively in an hour with 
two to four participants. Or by one 
person, for months, while the clear col- 
ors slowly change on the surface, like a 
tree through the seasons. 

These game paintings will only be 
meaningful when they have been made 
into mass multiple editions. 1971

O.F.: 2070. Notes for a Conference on Utopia 

The present is struggle, the future is yours 



These notes presuppose (1) that the 
world has reached a stage of surplus 
instead of want, and (2) that economic 
resources and political power have 
been shared among all people. 

— Since want and profit motive are 
no longer the governing forces, atten- 
tion can be concentrated more on: not 
which and how many goods and ser- 
vices are produced — but how work 
should be structured so that it benefits 
the development of the people doing it 
and has value for them. (cf. Andre 
Gorz on the theory that leisure activi- 
ties have no meaning unless they are an 
extension of work.) 

The intrinsic value of work— in- 
efficiency should thus be built into 
production: non-uniformity, decentra- 
lization, variation which can provide a 
choice. Irregular working hours. Pro- 
duction structured increasingly as crea- 
tive games, pleasurable and/or intellec- 
tually or politically stimulating. There 
will be many people engaged on plan- 
ning and structuring work in this way. 
It will be one of the functions of the 
artist. 

— The other requirement is rotation 
for those who work. Transfers, rather 
than lifelong tenure in one particular 
working role, will be regarded as the 
norm. The development of technology 
will in any case make it impossible for 
most people to keep up with the tech- 
nology of their jobs. We should there- 
fore move towards "superficial multi- 
specialization." 

Through rotation, those who work 
will also obtain a better overall view 
and be more easily able to practice self- 
management. All activity connected 
with self-management will be ranked 



equal— but even in this sphere people 
will not be cast into roles and form a 
separate managerial class. 

— The same applies to the manage- 
ment of society: computer technology 
can and must now be exploited, not to 
produce centralization and uniformity, 
but to deal with the complications and 
"inefficiency" which will arise and 
which can be valuable in themselves. 
To carry out decentralized imple- 
mentation of decisions taken in prin- 
ciple, and surveys of experts' conclu- 
sions. Telecommunications and com- 
puter technology will provide the 
opportunity for participation in (1) in- 
formation about, (2) discussions on, 
and (3) the making of decisions at all 



levels. Participation in that way in the 
administration of society is of course to 
be equated with work. Everybody will 
thus be engaged to a varying degree in 
politics — but there will be no politi- 
cians. 

Likewise all types of study will be 
equated with work. By means of tele- 
communications (image-transmitting 
telephones), studies will be pursued 
partly at home, at a distance from and 
in contact with various institutions and 
workplaces. (Automation has made the 
problem not one of finding enough 
workers, but of finding enough 
meaningful activities for those for 
whom there is too little work.) 

— Free minimum living require-

merits: accommodation, communica- 
tions and basic food will be provided 
free for everybody, irrespective of 
whether they work or not. If not 
everything can be free for all— yet— one 
could envisage being credited with a 
certain number of "units" for work 
done. They would be calculated in the 
same way for all work, unless it were 
particularly risky or stressful. 



The "units" could be entered (with 
radioactive isotopes or the like) on a 
card bearing invisible markings = iden- 
tification. "Units" and identity would 
be read by a machine when one took 
non-free goods, services, and entertain- 
ments, while one's account of "units" 
would be controlled by the computers 
to which all shops, institutions, and so 
on, would be connected. (Money, 




checks and credit cards would thus be 
superseded.) 

— Rotation requires a high degree of 
mobility not just within the work- 
place, but throughout the world. Dis- 
tance would no longer be regarded as a 
hindrance. Distant places could be 
reached by telecommunication or by 
travelling, both of which are assumed 
to be free. Free even for those who just 
want to explore the world and live on 
their allocation of free minimum living 
requirements. 

— The opportunities for "rotating" 
for certain periods to distant work- 
places will be increased by the fact that 
one's partner and/or children will be 
able to live in the modified extended 
families which constitute the home. 

Most people will not live in towns 
(which themselves will have been 
broken up and decentralized). Each 
family will live in a small house with 
bedroom and workroom and simple 
washing and cooking facilities. House- 
building will have been standardized 
and simplified: everyone will be able to 
build or extend their own houses. 

These mini-houses will form a group 
around an omni-house where there will 
be a communal kitchen, washing- 
machines, swimming pool, workshop, 
kennels, stables and space for children 
and for children and adults to be 
together. In principle, each extended 
family should establish its own multi- 
activity-house. Then groups of ex- 
tended families can plan and build lar- 
ger multi-activity-houses. But perhaps 
not so many houses will be needed. 

— A large part of people's creative 
and practical work will be allocated to 
the detoxification and reconstruction of

the environment. (A prerequisite will 
be the ability to modify temperature 
and weather.) Not just an attempt to 
make it look as before— but more 
beautiful, more wild, and at the same 
time more habitable than ever! The 
creation of forests, flowers, fruits, 
caves, ravines, streams which were 
never there before. The introduction of 
animals of all kinds that can live in a 
newlv-created but functioning ecolo- 
gical balance. Children and adults 
would from time to time retire to the 
countryside and build and live in their 
own dwellings there. 

The creation of large, continuous 
green areas will be facilitated bv the 
abolition of roads. "Paths" will remain, 
for pedestrians and cyclists. The mov- 
ing of goods, refuse and smaller means 
of transport will have been transferred 
to tunnels or aerial ropewavs. All 
heavier traffic will have been raised up 
into the air where there is space for 
vertically arranged routes instead of a 
road system which is polluting and 
wasteful of horizontal space at ground 
level. Cars will have been replaced bv 
communal mini-helicopters which can 
be called and landed bv remote-con- 
trolled autopilot. A network of jumbo- 
helicopters will have replaced lorries, 
buses and underground trams— with 
spectacular towers for getting on and 
off. (All this until the problem of de- 
materialized transportation has been 
solved, i.e. people and objects "recon- 
stituted" in the desired place. . . .) 

— To counteract isolation, the ex- 
tended family will alwavs have a num- 
ber of guests. Technicians, administra- 
tors and artists need to live in close 
touch with people in various different

localities, and people need to get to 
know and be able to question at close 
quarters (as opposed to contact via 
telecommunications) those who plan 
society. To entice them into ex- 
perimental situations, meditation exer- 
cises, telepathy, psvchodrama, group 
therapv and group sex. 

In the same way, elderlv people, 
foreigners, and particularly all those 
who have not managed to find a 
meaningful place in society— those who 
were previously described as criminals, 



down-and-outs, and mental, sexual and 
other deviants — should live as members 
of various extended families. (Cf. 
Greenland, where once murderers 
were boarded with families.) Thus the 
socially adjusted and the socially de- 
viant will together be able to put their 
way of life to the test, attain deeper 
awareness, and together experiment in 
madness.

O.F.: 121 Second Avenue 



We live in an old apartment in the East 
Village. There are still holes in the walls 
from the days of gas lighting. We have 
five rooms, most of them small, all of 
them with weird and unnecessary win- 
dow openings in the walls between 
them. When the building was con- 
structed, the regulations stipulated that 
each room must have at least two win- 
dows. Since the owners wanted as 
many rooms as possible in order to pull 
in more rent, they put in these make- 
believe windows. Which now make it 
impossible for us not to disturb each 
other if I, say, want to listen to the telly 
and Barbro to the radio. 



86 



The kitchen and Barbro's room face 
the yard, and have diagonally crossing 
grilles inside the windows. We thought 
at first it looked a bit prison-like, but 
they are partly hidden by bright cur- 
tains, and everyone has grilles to pro- 
tect them against thieves. (Some break- 
in teams therefore employ children — 
who can squeeze in between the grille 
and the inner jamb.) 

We've practiced finding the key to 
the grilles quickly, and getting them 
down in the event of fire. Day and 
night one hears wailing sirens and 
grunting horns as the fire brigade 
comes sliding down Second Avenue. It 



usually drives past, on to the great 
Puerto Rican slum districts down De- 
lancey Street. Several times, though, it 
has stopped on our block, and once 
(while we were away) the building had 
to be evacuated. 

My writing room and my studio 
face — without grilles — on to Second 
Avenue: pedestrian traffic there being 
so lively, all around the clock, that the 
risk of a break-in is judged to be smal- 
ler. In spite of the fact that on the out- 
side of the building hangs a fire escape, 
a rickety iron staircase along the 
facade. It has landings of a sort on each 
storey, but you are not really supposed 







to use these— previously, when we 
were living in the old studio near Wall 
Street and went out on our fire escape, 
the radio car stopped and the police 
told us off through a bullhorn. 

But in the East Village, once the 
Lower East Side of the poor Slavonic 
immigrants, things are more relaxed, 
it's more a sort of Southern Europe. 
Fat mommas and fat mongrels settle 
down on the fire escape, and contem- 
plate the street-life for hours on end. In 
the outermost and poorest part of the 
East Village, entire families of Puerto 
Ricans sit on the steps outside their 
door, talking, sewing, swilling beer and 



listening to the radio. Even the local 
mortician sits with his family outside 
his office. 



Autumn 

We are on our way home from one of 
Barbro's expeditions to photograph 
facades, on which she bases her paint- 
ings. As usual we had gotten up too 
late, and the viewfinder shows a red 
dot, which means it is too dark. A bit- 
ing wind sweeps down through the 
corridors of tall buildings lining the 
avenues. 

Obliquely across from the old brick 



building on Lafayette Street, where 
Rauschenberg lives, stands an old black 
down-and-out, warming himself by 
the fire he has made by setting light to 
one of the city's tall wire litter bins. 
His coat reaches to his feet, and on his 
head he has a great red wollen pants- 
leg. He is delineated, partly lit up, part- 
ly dark, against the deep blue twilight 
sky. 

Suddenly there is a bang, a huge 
flame shoots up, perhaps from some 
half-used spray tin among the garbage. 
The man's tattered coat begins to burn, 
he topples, and falls, fortunately, down 
onto the pavement so that the flames

are smothered, before I reach him. He 
does not seem particularly deterred, 
and we leave him sitting within reach 
of the blessed warmth. 

Another evening I go to see Saul, who 
has fallen ill. I find that he has dozed 
off, the apartment is silent. In the 
kitchen a girl from the RAT collective 
sits reading. Oda is out, she works with 
the radical women's group that has 
taken over the underground publica- 
tion RAT. Saul and Oda have a very 
small apartment, low-ceilinged, seedy 
but cosy, masses of books and maga- 
zines, plus darkened oriental textiles. 

Saul's magnificently prophetic Jew- 
ish face is emaciated but at the same 
time peaceful, the angry furrows at the 
root of his nose have smoothed out. 



When I come out onto the street it 
has grown darker, and the Puerto 
Rican bovs are still trying to repair 
something in the genitalia of a flashy 
fin-tail automobile that has seen better 
days. They are working now by the 
light from a fire made up in the nearest 
litter bin, which they have shifted 
down into the gutter. The transistor 
radio is on, the beer cans are out, and 
they are commenting vividly on the 
progress of the man crawling beneath 
the vehicle, which has been propped up 
along one side. In the fluttering flame 
of the fire, the scene takes on a mood at 
once threatening and cosy. 

And then Oda rang and said that 
Saul had lung cancer. He had been 
smoking two packs of cigarettes a day 
for the greater part of his 47 years. He 



was now at the Veteran's Hospital 
(having participated marginallv in the 
Korean War), which was at least better 
than the poor hospital, Bellevue, the 
only possible alternative. 

Saul had been touring in Europe 
with the Living Theatre, and was writ- 
ing a book about them. He had been 
very active in the movement against the 
war in Vietnam. There were frequent 
visitors to his room at the hospital, it 
sometimes became almost a sort of 
underground literary salon— while Saul 
lay there somehow out of things. 

"It's so stupid to die, so stupid . . ." 
he once said, desperately, and obsti- 
natelv. He dug in his heels against the 
pessimistic prognosis of the disin- 
terested doctors, "a few weeks left." 
He held out for four months. 



89 



We read that he had died in the Village 
Voice. It said that his friends should 
foregather at the La Mama Theatre. 
There was a problem of how to arrange 
the burial etc. of someone both irreli- 
gious and unconventional. Was this to 
be a ceremony, a reception, a funeral 
feast, or what? 

The La Mama is a large, oblong 
room with tiers of benches along three 
of its sides. It was in semidarkness, 
someone was sitting improvising 
meditative jazz on the piano. A whole 
crowd of people had turned up, includ- 
ing numerous children who were chas- 
ing round a construction in the center 
of the room. A stack of black sugar- 
crates with a strip of red cloth draped 
obliquely down over it, an anarchistic 
emblem, unpatheticallv casual. 

Oda came in, slim, pale and hollow- 
eyed, very long thin blond hair, her 
little daughter on her arm. Two or 
three people said some words in mem- 
ory, including a priest who had been 
active in the resistance movement (bell- 
bottomed check trousers, white cardi- 
gan). We thought it was all over, but 
then La Mama herself, Ellen Stewart, 



asked in her soft, Caribbean accent if 
perhaps anyone else felt like saying 
something. 

So, a young man got up and started 
telling us about how he remembered 
Saul. Saul's sensitivitv, plus his inge- 
nuity in difficult situations — with the 
police, prving customs officials, credi- 
tors. A woman then took over, fol- 
lowed by Schechner, a professor of 
drama and leader of a group theater. 
Female students, bohemians, activists, 
dramatists ... A middle-aged academic, 
an acquaintance from the fifties, talked 
about the davs "before things began to 
go downhill for Saul" (dissatisfied 
growls from the congregation). 

Without noticing it, one sat there 
breathlessly caught up in a theatrical 
performance unlike all the others at La 
Mama. An improvised play about a 
person, in which the actors and the 
audience were the same people. 

The picture gradually emerged of a 
man who had left behind very few solid 
products, but who had clearly inspired, 
irritated, aroused to awareness and 
amused remarkably many people. 
Several speakers had only met him a 



couple of times, but had undergone a 
powerful experience in these meetings, 
in some cases one that had changed 
their lives. 

They all spoke unprepared, with that 
admirable ability Americans have, as 
naturally as if they were sitting round a 
table with old friends. To some extent, 
this was also how one began to feel. A 
couple of girls wept unrestrainedly as 
they spoke. Others narrated comic epi- 
sodes. The kids made a row, and gal- 
loped tirelessly about. 

Had I been able to express myself 
freely and unprepared in American, 1 
would have said something like this. 

"In some way, Saul, for me, was al- 
ways connected with Trouble. The first 
time I saw him, in Paris, at the home of 
the sculptor Kowalski, he had just been 
in Cuba: he had been thrown out of 
there, when he tried to help some 
clumsy Englishman who happened to 
have filmed some port facilities. 

On the next occasion, I read in New 
York how Saul had been unable to re- 
strain himself during a destructive hap- 
pening with the slaughter of chickens,

and with Charlotte Moorman, who 
was to smash up a violin. Saul lumped 
forward and rescued the instrument, in 
a wild brawl. 

Saul once assisted in organizing the 
sabotaging of a McCarthyist interview 
program on television. I remember 
how the lively Saul, in the studio, could 
not help jeopardizing our facade as in- 
nocent onlookers, armed some of us 
with eggs, others with hidden cameras 
and tape recorders. I was terribly ner- 
vous, but got by unnoticed with my 
bulky Nagra hidden in a bag. 



Saul stormed unhesitatingly onto the 
stage, trying to get the interviewer up 
against a wall with his questions. He 
and a young motherfucker activist 
were brutally maltreated in the elevator 
and at the precinct station. The follow- 
ing morning I was with his friends 
down on 100 Centre Street, bailing the 
two of them out with the monev we 
had scraped together. Saul showed us 
the bare spots on his scalp where the 
cops had pulled out hanks of his hair. 

Two weeks later Oda rang again, 
wondering if I could come down to 



Centre Street. For what? We had all 
taken part in an illegal demonstration 
the dav before, but had escaped being 
picked up. Ah ves, but on the way 
home Saul had tried to incite some sol- 
diers ot the Salvation Army to take 
sides against the cops, and had im- 
mediately been pulled in. 

We saw a lot of each other during the 
lively spring of '6S. In the fall, he 
almost succumbed to the burden of 
work and responsibility as manager for 
the Living Theater's tour in the States, 
and leader of a radical group theater

agency. A greedy lawyer finally put a 
stop to that activity. 

Then we were in Sweden for a long 
time. Last spring Saul and Oda were to 
come up to us with Barbro's sewing- 
machine, which they had borrowed. 
But the sewing machine had been 
stolen, and as usual they were short of 
money. Saul was busy with a work- 
shop about the economic theories of 
the early Anarchists. 

When I came back last fall, Saul was 
sick. He was often resigned, tortured. 



But he fought, angrily, against this new 
and greatest Trouble. Oda read books 
about the right food when sick, and 
tried to give him a natural diet and 
vitamins (instead of the wretched hos- 
pital food)." 

Meanwhile the mood has shifted. Two 
women are speaking critically about 
Saul's not having understood Women's 
Liberation. Someone says that this is 
ridiculous, working ourselves up to a 
confessional mood and letting our egos 



hang out (and with La Mama as usual 
expressing thanks for each solo per- 
formance). We should embrace each 
other. Dance. Sing. Offer each other 
smokes. Saul's academic friend ob|ects: 
"Let us part in silence." 

The meeting dissolves in heated dis- 
putes, while a young man starts rolling 
and offers marihuana in cigarette papers 
decorated all over with the American 
flag. Saul would have approved the end 
of his funeral feast.

S.O.M.B.A. (Some of My Basic Assumptions) 
Variable painting 1972—73 






1. Basic Assumption. All people are 
different, but everyone is of equal 
worth. 

2. Class. Needs. Marxism is about de- 
stroying class differences, not differ- 
ences between individuals. 

"From everyone according to his 
ability, to everyone according to his 
needs." 



3. "Human Nature." Are people in- 
trinsically evil (aggressive, etc.)? Or are 
they basically good? 

People are conditioned by society. 
"There are no evil people, only evil 
governments." (Ho Chi Min) 

4. The Brain, The Family. "After hu- 
mans were born, their brain almost 
trebled in size. Thus childhood had to 



be lengthened. . . . This brain, di- 
vested of its precise instinctive re- 
sponses, would learn how to utilize 
what it received from others." (L. 
Eiseley) 

Pressured to survive, unsure of their 
instinctual responses, humans develop 
neurosis: a mechanism for adjusting to 
society. 

Neurosis is transferred through gen- 



96 



erations and is institutionalized. The 
neurotic-repressive-patriarchal family : 
a model for society. (Wilhelm Reich) 

5. Two Economies. A) Capitalism. 
Lopsided development: development 
for the strongest, for "the best." (Up: 
wealth and power for the elite; con- 
sumer goods; technology; elite educa- 
tion. Down: employment and job con- 
trol; health pensions, schools, housing, 
etc.). 

Basis: profit. People are a factor of 
production, a mean to an end: capital 
output. 

B) China. Development for all (even 
for the weakest). 

Basis: cooperation. Production is a 
mean, people are an end. (Even if effi- 
ciency is lowered). 



6. Capitalism. What is wrong with 
capitalism? It benefits the few and ex- 
ploits the many. 

It promotes greed. The stock mar- 
ket: playing Monopoly with the fruits 
of people's labor. 

It promotes aggressiveness. (In Eng- 
lish, "aggressive" is frequently used in 
a positive sense). USA: world record of 
homicides — 6.8 per 100,000 persons. 
(No. 2: Finland - 3.4 per 100,000). 
USA: 190 million privately owned 
guns — an average of 1 — 1/2 per house- 
hold. 

USA: the slaughter of a small coun- 
try (Vietnam). The basic paradox: since 
people are conditioned by society, 
society should be good, or should be 
changed. But people are already shaped 
by no-good societies. 



"Thus the existing society is repro- 
duced not only in the minds of men, 
but also in their senses, and no persua- 
sion can break this petrified sensibil- 
ity." (Marcuse) 

7. Gradualism. Recommended by 
American Social Democrats. Imple- 
mented by Labor governments in 
Western Europe. 

The program: by reforms, under- 
mine and ultimately break capitalism. 

The reality: strengthen the Social 
Democratic and union bureaucracy, 
while co-administering the nation with 
the capitalist powers. The result is to 
legitimize and to strengthen capitalism. 

In addition, the myth "we have con- 
tained capitalism." People are pacified 
with certain reforms and with consum-

er goods. Payed for with high taxes and 
prices. 

Sweden. After forty years of Labor 
rule: 6 per cent of business national- 
ized, 5 per cent owned by the coopera- 
tive movement. 

8. The Knot of Imperialism: Expan- 
sion and Racism. The capitalist firm, 
based on the profit motive, tends to 
produce more than can be consumed. 

The expansion spiral: more profit 
buys more machines that produce 
more goods. So the corporations "must 
strive to acquire new markets in both 
the product and the geographical 
senses. One leads to conglomeration, 
the other to multinationahsm." (P. 
Sweezy) 

Racism: (white) Americans are the 
Master Race. 

"Without air supremacy, we would 
be an easy prey for any yellow dwarf 
with a pocket-knife" (Lyndon John- 
son). "A Mongoloid Trotskyite" 
(Time magazine on Ho Chi Mm) 

On the battlefield, the "Viet Cong" 
are seen as "fanatics." "VC" is a pun 
on WC, promoted by the US psycho- 
logical warfare. 

"The struggle against imperialism is 
partly a struggle to see the Vietnamese 
as human beings." (Tom Hayden) 

9. Three Dictatorships. USA: dicta- 
torship of profit. USSR: dictatorship of 
the Party. 

China: dictatorship of Party and 
people. On the national level: complete 
top-down control. (1970 Cambodia in- 
vasion: a million demonstrators in Pe- 
king. 1972 mining of Haiphong: not 
one demonstrator. Nixon's visit to 
China: no discussion of this among the 
people). On the local level, extensive 
participation, especially since the 
Cultural Revolution. 

In the ideal People's Republic of the 
future: 



1) decentralize most power func- 
tions 

2) rotate all key positions 

3) create channels for participation 
(videophone debates? — homes and jobs 
hooked into computers for national, 
regional and local referenda?) 

10. Martians. We are like Martians on 
this planet. (The industrial nations in 
Europe, America, USSR, Japan, etc.) 

Alienated: from our body — our 
mind — our work — society — elite or gar- 
bage culture — nature— the world. 

A colossal waste of the energy of 
people's lives. 

11. The Revolt of The Sixties. Palesti- 
nians, N. Ireland, Uruguay, Bangla- 
desh and W. Bengal, Indochina, etc. 

USA. The National Guard was cal- 
led out- 1920-30: 78 times; 1940-50: 
22; 1967: 25; 1968: 104. 

France. Paris, May 1968, workers 
and students unite. Factories occupied. 
But the Stalinist CP and union stall 
until it is too late. 

"The new sensibility has been the 
great force in the first powerful rebel- 
lion /Paris, May 68/ for a qualitatively 
different way of life." (Marcuse) 

During crisis, radical consciousness 
grows naturally. Thought and action 
go hand in hand. Personal and social 
liberation. National (or racial) struggle 
and class struggle. 

12. Three IPs. The Left in "peace" 
— time: confusion, infighting, and end- 
less splits. 

The radical groups in USA might be- 
come a force. 

IF they unite for larger actions 
(strikes, demonstrations). And in the 
future: if they form a coalition Third 
Party, and put out a widespread daily 
newspaper of the Left. 

IF they find where their communi- 



ties are, and how to connect to them. 
(Women, minorities, interest groups, 
neighborhood activity). 

IF the individuals are able to know 
themselves. They study theories of re- 
volution, but in their life they occa- 
sionally act according to patriarchal 
petty bourgeois values. And are unable 
to attract new people into the move- 
ment. 

13. Three Risks. The Women's 
Movement. Involution: personal lib- 
eration, meditation, therapy, etc. as an 
end in itself, i.e. to be contented in a 
sick society. 

Separatism: for instance, Black na- 
tionalism, Black political power, Afri- 
can life-style, etc. as an end. 

Fashion. Two weeks after Nixon's 
visit to China: "Mao-suits" in New 
York's upper East Side stores. Ten 
months later: Mao-prints by Andy 
Warhol. 

Could a radical women's movement 
tip the scale in the USA? 

Maybe, since the women's move- 
ment (along with labor) is the only 
potential mass movement in the USA. 
Also the women's will to change grows 
out of their entire life situation: an 
evolving, self-made new consciousness. 

It could lead to "a weakening of 
the primary aggressiveness which, by 
biological and social factors, has gov- 
erned the patriarchal culture. ... In De- 
lacroix's painting, it is a woman that 
leads the people on the barricades. She 
carries a rifle, for the end of violence 
has still to be fought for." (Marcuse) 

14. Future Society. No existing 
socialist nation is a truly integrated 
People's Republic. But there are some 
good micro-societies: collectives in 
China and in the West, liberated areas 
in Indochina, Africa, etc. 

Six points for a future society (based 



98 



on an article by P. Sweezy, Monthly 
Review, 1972: 2). 

EQUALITY: not only in a material 
sense, but in access to education and 
power. Workers must participate in 
management, managers in manual work. 

FREEDOM of discussion and criti- 
cism. And of creative expression. Not 
by creating a state-financed elite of fan- 
tasy parasites — but by artists participat- 
ing in society, on all levels ("pure" and 
applied art, social proiects, manual 
work). 

COMBINE agricultural and indust- 
rial development, and DECENTRAL- 
IZE: break up urban agglomeration. 

WORK: must become not only a 
means — for production, for income 
etc. — but be dealt with as "life's most 
important creative activity." — (And in 
Utopia: everyone a life-artist.) 

BALANCE. "Needs like food, shel- 
ter, leisure, etc., must be brought into 
balance with each other, and with so- 
ciety's resources and the environment. 
The absurd and disastrous bourgeois 
notion of insatiable wants must be re- 
pudiated." 

SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION. 
Eliminate the present system of dis- 
tribution: services and goods acquired 
through earning and spending of 
money. Free services and goods 
(according to need). An end to all rela- 
tions between value and commodity. 

15. A New Sensibility. "The new re- 
bellion is both moral and aesthetic, 
rather than a clear-cut class struggle." 
(Marcuse) 

Vietnam. According to Kim Chi, a 
Vietnamese woman teacher, the NLF 
soldier should combine an "imposing 
appearance" with a "romantic qual- 
ity. . . . He shows his 'romantic quality' 
when he installs a wire on the trees in 
such a manner that birds can perch on 
it and sing on it." 



NLF-bulletin: "Soldier, spring in 
Vietnam is ineffably beautiful. Apricot 
blossoms cheer your feats, and swal- 
lows soar, waiting for good tidings. 
Fire of outrage, once your eyes have 
been opened. And, in lieu of flowers 
and ornament, Vietnam's spring with 
everlasting beauty!" 

USA and Western Europe. The three 
major trends 

1. Dada. Zen. John Cage. The six- 
ties: new art, poetry, music, dance, 
events, mixed media. The Living Thea- 
ter. Counterculture, new life-style, 
communalism, new drugs. 

2. Ways to self-realization. Mysti- 
cism, meditation. New Psychology. 
Reich, Lowen, Janov, Schultz, Perls, 
Laing. 

3. New consciousness: women, mi- 
norities. 

USSR: the political (material) re- 
volution that never grew into a psycho- 
logical revolution. 

USA. Maybe, in the future, USA 
will generate some kind of psycholo- 
gical revolution. But will it ever be- 
come political? 

The dilemma: can you be happy (in- 
dividual happiness = the deep and total 
being in the Now) and still feel enough 
outrage to rebel? 

16. To Rebel. The rebel/radical 

— is not a "fanatic" (brave enemies 
of USA, are at best "fanatical") 

— is not moved by the intellectual 
appeal of an ideology 

— is not a pragmatist, looking for 
success stories (Social Democrats like 
Harrington, etc.: US is capitalist, Chi- 
na is totalitarian, everything so bad, so 
sad . . .) 

Being radical is about moral commit- 
ment. A sense of outrage, once your 
eyes have been opened. And, ideally, it 
should permeate every aspect of your 
life. 



Question no. 1 for the future. Will 
"the worms" erode the existing, capi- 
talist or socialist-bureaucratic power 
structures? 

China: local self-management. 
USSR: underground dissent. USA and 
Western Europe: movements of 
women, minorities, anti-Vietnam war, 
rank and file. Third World: liberation 
movements. 

17. My Work. "The bourgeois artist 
paints the hulk of a sinking ship." (B. 
Brecht) 

Question: isn't it "radical chic" to 
try to sell paintings criticizing capital- 
ism, to rich people and institutions in 
USA? 

1. As long as you live in a capitalist 
system, you are a part of it, whether 
you make art or drive cabs. 

2. Supposing I were to sell a work to 
Mr. X, he would have to pay my price, 
thus enabling me to go on with my 
work. Supposing I had to drive one of 
X's cabs, I would have to take what he 
offered me, and I would be unable to 
do art work. 

(P.S. Remember, your art works are 
purchased with stolen money— surplus 
taken from workers.) 

3. Only via art gallery shows do you 
reach out to museums, print editions, 
books, etc. 

Ideally, I would like to make enough 
money to subsidize mass multiples of 
my works, priced like LP's and books. 
Ultimately, a self-supporting alterna- 
tive distribution system. 

4. For me, it has been important to 
demonstrate in my works that "heavy" 
art (not cartoons, etc.) can be critical 
and socially concerned. Of course, 
most heavy art is not a tool for political 
change. 

But artists can be (could be). Orga- 
nize. Publish. Speak. Demonstrate. 
Strike. Work in community.

O.F. 



Recently I have been making hundreds 
of improvisations to arrive at shapes 
that are both interesting in themselves, 
and totally "un-natural" to the factual 
content and to the space needed for the 
facts. At best these clashes result in 
forms that may have something of the 
surprising beauty of tropical fish. 

In my last works (the two Chile 
paintings and Latin America Puzzle) 
historic and economic data largely have 
been supplanted by "facts" taken from 
poems by Sylvia Plath and Lorca. 



The loss of Chile cannot be express- 
ed merely by depicting a succession of 
events. In Latin America, trade imba- 
lance, foreign aid stipulations, mono- 
culture, denationalization, etc., are not 
dry textbook facts, but conditions that 
involve immeasurable suffering and de- 
gradation. 

Those who consider the musical and 
poetical dimension of my work as an 
evasion or as an opportunistic sugar- 
coating of serious conditions, I would 
remind of the scene in Tosca where 



torture goes on off-stage. Meanwhile, 
on stage, Puccini's belcanto flows. This 
seemingly tasteless juxtaposition illus- 
trates a basic paradox in the art of all 
times. 

That is, the search to create a fusion 
of insight and pleasure. To formulate 
the terrifying shortness of life and the 
terrible shortcomings in a world where 
we struggle to experience and to create 
happiness.

Pontus Hulten: 

Oyvind Fahlstrom, Citizen of the World 



What struck me every time I met 
Oyvind was his purity, his integrity. 
He was, without doubt, the least cor- 
rupted person I have ever met. The day 
Oyvind died, the world became a 
poorer place; a very unusual and re- 
markable person was lost. Oyvind was 
an artist, a writer, and a journalist. He 
was a completely international person, 
with an infinite curiosity about life in 
all its forms, a wide knowledge of the 
most disparate subjects, and he was 
also a very courageous man .... 

It seems to me now in retrospect as if 
Oyvind represented, in the best pos- 
sible way, the generation which was 
involved with the revolutionary move- 
ments leading up to May 1968. He rep- 
resents them because he was such a 
typical campaigner of that period, and 
he represents them in the extraordinary 
quality that characterizes all his con- 
tributions before, during and after that 
important year. It is no coincidence 
that some of the best criticism that was 
expressed of the political movements, 
opinions and ideas of 1968 is to be 
found in Oyvind's film, Provocation. It 
will be no surprise if in the future this 
film comes to be regarded as one of the 
prime sources for a better knowledge 
and understanding of that fantastic mo- 
ment in modern history, of the ideas 
and problems raised by events and de- 
velopments for those involved or just 
interested, when the Spring of 1968 
was over. 

Oyvind was an international person, 
not just because he was born in Brazil 
of Swedish and Norwegian parents, 
and during his short life lived in Stock- 
holm, New York, Paris and Italy, and 
could read at least five languages, but 



primarily because his way of thinking 
was completely international, and he 
was always aware of the world as an 
integral whole. He designed many 
maps of the world according to his 
own concepts. He was well-read on 
Africa, South America and the Far 
East; he read about geography, econo- 
mics, history .... He delighted in the 
diversity and richness of the world; he 
was always interested in the new, the 
unusual and the striking. He wanted to 
become better acquainted with the 
absurd and the shocking, and he was 
increasingly disturbed by the unjust 
organization of the world and the bru- 
tality of political and economic power. 
Oyvind's curiosity, however, was 
not restricted to modern history and 
present world conditions. When I first 
met him some time at the beginning of 
the fifties, he had just finished with his 
Pre-Columbian studies. (Old Mexican 
manuscripts had an influence on his 
first paintings.) He had been immers- 
ing himself for some time in the history 
of Surrealism, and was already familiar 
with it in all its details. In 1953 that was 
rather unusual, and it was hardly useful 
or widespread knowledge in academic 
or other circles. He knew every phase 
in the various quarrels and con- 
troversies within the Surrealist group, 
the intrigues, the excommunications; 
but he was also well-acquainted with 
Surrealist painting, poetry, films .... It 
is obvious from the first large painting 
Oyvind produced, Ade-Ledic-Nander, 
which he had begun the following year, 
that he must also have studied astro- 
nomy, theories on the origin of the 
planets, and that he had read the new 
science-fiction books that had started 



to appear at that time. He had an enor- 
mous appetite for knowledge, but his 
choice of reading matter was totally 
unacademic. His desire for knowledge 
was very soon to be supplemented by 
an urge to create: and his creations 
were to be just as unusual and surpris- 
ing. 

His Ade-Ledic-Nander period lasted 
three years. The larger of the two 
paintings, number two, now in the 
Moderna Museet in Stockholm, occu- 
pied him for the greater part of that 
time. During that period I got to know 
Oyvind well. Every Friday evening he 
used to invite all those who were in- 
terested to come and look at the prog- 
ress of the painting. His demonstration 
technique was unconventional. Having 
cut holes in a sheet which he had then 
hung in front of the canvas, he would 
describe only that part which could be 
seen through the hole. This was to en- 
sure that his audience would not be 
distracted by other parts of the paint- 
ing and would not be led astray by 
aesthetic considerations, such as admir- 
ing the composition in its entirety. He 
maintained that he also kept the sheet 
there while he was painting in order 
not to be tempted himself to make con- 
cessions to the composition as a whole 
at the cost of content. Discussions in 
the art world during those years were 
very much concerned with the ques- 
tion of to what extent art should be 
figurative or non-figurative. Oyvind's 
painting, of course, was neither the one 
nor the other. It depicted only what 
was to be found in Oyvind's personal 
visionary world or worlds. Decorative 
effects from non-figurative art had no 
place there. 



106 



Oyvind was living at that time in a 
small apartment in Sundbyberg, at 
Rasundavagen 55—57. During the sea- 
son, the cheering when a goal was 
scored in the matches at Rasunda foot- 
ball stadium could be heard as an 
accompaniment to Oyvind's descrip- 
tions of his painting. These descrip- 
tions were extraordinarily complicated 
and difficult to follow; they were a 
kind of abstract science-fiction con- 
cerned only with the elements of the 
world that he had invented and fixed 
on the canvas. 

The creation of Ade-Ledic-Nander 
also became more and more fascinating 
because of the very special way Oyvind 
went to work. During the latter part of 
the period he was working on it, he had 
to construct a sort of jetty or bridge 
over the painting, which was lying flat 
on the floor, in order to be able to get 
to the parts in the middle which he 
could no longer reach from the sides. 
Oyvind's methods of solving practical 
problems were always very unusual. 

I do not think that Oyvind ever 
made any particular efforts to draw 
attention to himself, or to get people to 
write about him in the newspapers, for 
example. But he was in the news at 
least twice during his time in Sweden: 
he was involved in two "scandals." On 
each occasion the affair was blown up 
out of all proportion. He had a keen 
sense of the ridiculous. He never told 
funny stories; it was the absurdity of 
life that he managed to catalyse and 
express. 

The first time Oyvind found himself 
on the front pages was early in his 
career. Somebody had decided to put 
on an exhibition of a form of art called 
Tachisme, which most people have 
now fortunately forgotten all about. 
For not very obvious reasons Oyvind 
had been invited to take part. He was 
away at the time and could not arrange 




Paris IS 



Ostlibn, Pontus Hulten 



the delivery of his paintings or super- 
vise the hanging of them. He left a 
parcel of the paintings with a friend, to 
be collected by the exhibition organ- 
izers. In the exhibition, they displayed 
the pieces of cardboard which Oyvind 
had used as packing and which he had 
earlier used to wipe his brushes on. 
What outraged Oyvind so much in 
these particular circumstances was that 
professional people could believe that 
his painting could look like that, and he 
was so shaken that he went to the pa- 
pers to get publicity for the whole 
affair. But I think that Oyvind always 
had a very special and personal, a kind 
of elastic, relationship to reality. He 
was impractical to such an extent that it 
became something else altogether. The 
simplest way to describe Oyvind's 
perception of the world would prob- 
ably be to say that for him nothing was 
impossible. His impracticality was so 
extreme that it was a gift, a talent, a 
form of freedom. The technical side of 
painting remained for Oyvind a kind of 



enchanted forest where he could meet 
with unforeseen success or where the 
worst possible misfortunes could be 
lying in wait. On the occasions when 
he collaborated with engineers or sci- 
entists on a project, things always went 
very well, probably because Oyvind, 
unlike most other artists, had no pre- 
conceptions of how his ideas were to 
be realized. He left all decisions on 
practical matters to the engineers with 
whom he was collaborating. 

Oyvind's very special kind of rela- 
tionship to the world made his mode of 
existence at one and the same time con- 
ventional and unconventional. I believe 
he used certain conventions as anchors 
to fasten himself in some way to the 
world we live in. They were a kind of 
tacit arrangement— links which made 
everyday life easier, but which he was 
not inclined to discuss; they were 
"practical" measures, nothing more. 
On the other hand, Oyvind was so un- 
conventional in other respects, espe- 
cially concerning everything to do with

the creative side of his art, that he could 
surprise even the most advanced col- 
leagues of his generation. 

Perhaps the story of Oyvind's other 
"scandal" in Stockholm can shed a 
little light on his attitude to conven- 
tions. On this occasion there was more 
provocation than when he hit the head- 
lines the first time. Ovvind had been 
invited to take part in a television de- 
bate about drugs. After a while the dis- 
cussion was taking its usual course, 
when Ovvind suddenlv picked up a 
pipe and said, "This pipe is full of 
mari|uana, and I intend to smoke it 



now; you'll see me start to have hallu- 
cinations, and in any case you'll have to 
send for the police so that they can 
arrest me." For several days Ovvind 
was the "drug-tripper" in the news- 
papers. Whether it was mari|uana or 
tobacco in the pipe was never estab- 
lished, but I should think it was mari- 
juana. Ovvind was always very moral 
in his methods; it might look as if he 
was cheating, as for instance in the 
story of Mao and Bob Hope, but he 
never did. His method, one might say, 
was morality. But of course it was his 
own definition of morality that he 



used, composed of his own set of con- 
ventions. 

When Ovvind came to New York at 
the beginning of the sixties, he very 
quickly became part of the city's inter- 
national art circles. He met and became 
friendly with all the members of the 
first and second generation of Pop- 
artists: Rauschenberg and Johns, Ol- 
denburg, Dine, Rosenquist, Lichten- 
stein, Warhol, Segal and others. Their 
art is individually distinctive; but 
Ovvind's was different in a fun- 
damental wav. While the Pop artists 
attempted to subjugate the elements of 



108 



American daily life in order thus to 
reestablish the links between art and 
life, leaving, like Rauschenberg for ex- 
ample, a sufficiently large gap between 
the two to be able to give at least a 
glimpse of the future, Oyvind could 
never from the very first ignore his in- 
terest in the world as an entity and in 
its moral and political aspects. In New 
York in those davs that way of looking 
at things was called "European," but I 
think that in Oyvind's case it was his 
own personal position. During the fol- 
lowing years, when he returned to 
Europe virtually everv summer, it was 
always the same Ovvind one met, full 
of plans, intense and single-minded. In 
some ways he changed very little over 
the years. In New York he developed 
what was to become his future life- 
style: working at night, sleeping in the 
morning, studying and collecting mate- 
rial for his works in the afternoon, 
sometimes going to the opening of an 
exhibition or to a film in the evening. 
Oyvind was the only artist I have met 
who could paint and watch television 
at the same time. The actual execution 
of the painting, the craftsmanship, did 
not interest him, and he would some- 
times leave it to others, who according 
to him could do it better than he could. 
His wife, Barbro Ostlihn, was re- 
sponsible for practical matters for 
many years, even in respect to many of 
the paintings. Oyvind would already 
have worked out the whole content of 
the picture in his head and in drawings, 
and the rest was merely a question of 
implementing the idea. As he was 
finishing one painting, he was already 
thinking of the next; he would be in a

ferment with all the facts and ideas he 
had in hand at that moment: political 
facts and events, historical facts, spy- 
stories, anecdotes, social items, ghost- 
stones of various kinds, scandals, oddi- 
ties from the gutter-press .... It cannot 
be said that Oyvind's art became more 
personal during these years, but it 
seems to me that his art was always 
entirely uninfluenced by others, and it 
became more characteristic and coher- 
ent. In the last years before his death, 
something of the occasional stiffness 



disappeared; the pictures became softer 
and the compositions more flowing 
and harmonious. Oyvind had found a 
method of working which he had long 
sought. 

At the time of his death the world of 
art, with the exception of a few of his 
colleagues, had not yet discovered that 
Oyvind was one of the great artists of 
his era. This exhibition will show the 
richness and freshness in this art, cre- 
ated by a very unusual person who was 
also the most lovable friend.
