FOREWORD 



The selection of works illustrated in this 
guide to the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection has been based on several 
related considerations. The number of 
masterpieces in the collection's relatively 
small holdings is as high as in many a 
larger museum of Modern art. 
Furthermore, these outstanding works 
exemplify some of the major art 
movements of the first half of the 
twentieth century. The selection of works 
and the order in which they appear have 
been determined by both quality and the 
historical progress of the avant-garde, 
from Cubism to European abstraction in 
its various manifestations, Surrealism, 
and American Abstract Expressionism. 
Indeed, Peggy Guggenheim herself viewed 
the collection — foreseen from its 
inception as a museum of Modern art — as 
a presentation of Modernism's history. 
This notion of the museum collection as 
an encyclopedia of masterpieces, 
representing in its scope and depth the 
historical passage of a cultural period, has 
driven the collecting practices of most 
contemporary institutions. Yet clearly no 
museum can pretend to completeness. 
More interesting perhaps is the 
individuality of the collection and those 
elements specific to its historical 
development. In his essay for this 
publication, Philip Rylands describes the 



extraordinary role Peggy Guggenheim 
assumed as an art collector, and the 
decisive influences that determined her 
impressive personal collection. The 
presence of certain art works in this 
handbook — the paintings by Tancredi and 
Edmondo Bacci, for example, or the 
numerous examples of the work of Max 
Ernst and Jackson Pollock — reflect 
biographical and historical situations that 
informed Peggy's choices. 

This publication relies for most of its 
text on entries by Lucy Flint and 
Elizabeth C. Childs that appeared in the 
1983 and subsequent editions of 
Handbook: The Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection. The 1983 catalogue was the 
first to be published on the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection under the 
administration of the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation, and it benefited 
from research undertaken by Angelica 
Zander Rudenstine for her award- 
winning catalogue raisonne of the 
collection, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, 
Venice: The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Foundation (1985). We would like 
therefore to acknowledge the 
contributions of these authors, which in 
the case of Dr. Rudenstine's are 
monumental. 

Many Guggenheim staff members lent 
their expertise to this project. The quality 



of the superb color images is the work of 
David Heald, Chief Photographer, 
Manager of Photographic Services. 
Curator of Collections and Exhibitions 
Lisa Dennison assisted in the difficult 
selection of works, while Juliet Nations- 
Powell, former Collections Curatorial 
Assistant, contributed valuable research. 
The efforts of Anthony Calnek, Director 
of Publications; Elizabeth Levy, Managing 
Editor; Laura Morris, Senior Editor; 
Jennifer Knox White, Associate Editor; 
Carol Fitzgerald, Assistant Editor; Edward 
Weisberger, Editor; Melissa Secondino, 
Production Assistant; and Keith Mayerson 
were essential to the production of this 
catalogue. We also wish to recognize the 
work of Philip Rylands, Deputy Director, 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection, who 
contributed enormously to the 
development of this project, and the able 
staff who manage the Venice museum. We 
are also grateful to Patrick Seymour, Tsang 
Seymour Design, for his graceful design of 
this catalogue. 

The works of art illustrated herein all 
belonged to Peggy Guggenheim; it is 
therefore to her, and to the artists who 
created them, that this book is dedicated.

THE STORY OF A 
MUSEUM-COLLECTION 

Philip Ry lands 



Peggy Guggenheim used to say that it was 
her duty to protect the art of her own 
time. She dedicated half of her life to 
this mission, as well as to the creation of 
the museum in Venice that still carries 
her name. 

THE GUGGENHEIMS 
The Guggenheims originated in German- 
speaking Switzerland. An impoverished 
Simon Guggenheim, Peggy's great- 
grandfather, emigrated to Philadelphia in 
1847. Beginning as peddlers, but soon 
producing stove polish and coffee 
essence, Simon and his son Meyer 
prospered. It was Meyer who was the 
architect of the family fortune. By 1880 
he was a millionaire, thanks to his 
manufacturing and importation 
businesses, but the Guggenheims 1 really 
immense wealth came from metals. The 
fortune dated from Meyer's 1879 
purchase of an interest in lead and silver 
mines in Leadville, Colorado. In 1900 the 
Guggenheims took control of the 
American Smelting and Refining 
Company, a legend in the history of 

Peggy Guggenheim in a gold lame dress with 
Oriental top by Paul Poiret and a headdress by 
Vera Stravinsky, photographed in Paris around 
1924 by Man Ray. This image was published 
in 192 s in a Swedish magazine article about 
Paris socialites. 



American corporate capitalism. Beginning 
in 1907, in partnership with J. P. Morgan 
and Jacob Schiff, the Guggenheims forged 
a railroad through the tundra to mine 
Kennecott, a mountain in Alaska made 
up of about three-quarters pure copper. 
In 1 9 10 the Guggenheims bought the 
Chuquicamata mine in Chile, which 
would yield 300 million tons of copper. 
By the beginning of World War I, the 
Guggenheims were reported to own 
between 75 and 80 percent of the world's 
silver, copper, and lead. 

Born in 1898, Peggy Guggenheim was 
the second daughter of Benjamin 
Guggenheim, Meyer's sixth child, but her 
share in the family fortune was to be a 
modest one. Benjamin, the handsomest of 
Meyer's sons, was something of a 
playboy. He petulantly left the family 
business in 1901. Therefore, when he 
drowned on the Titanic in April 19 12 
(his dignified, even heroic behavior 
forms part of the Titanic legend), Peggy 
and her mother, Florette Seligman, 
found themselves mere spectators as the 
vast riches of the Guggenheims grew 
and grew.' 

Hence, Peggy never had unlimited 
funds. During the spring of 1 959, when 
she was planning her museum in London, 
Peggy recalled, "I tried to think of ways 
to cut down my own personal expenses, 
in order to have sufficient money for the

project. . . . Actually I did not have nearly 
enough money for this venture as I had 
commitments of about ten thousand 
dollars a year to various old friends and 
artists whom I had been supporting for 
years. I could not suddenly let them down 
for the museum. . . . Every penny that I 
could raise was to be used for the 
museum." 1 Peggy's commitment to art 
required some of the qualities handed 
down by her grandfather Meyer — 
determination and imagination. She 
called upon those qualities as she set out 
to create a museum of contemporary art. 



GUGGENHEIM JEUNE 
Peggy's career in Modern art began in 
January 1938, when she opened the 
Guggenheim Jeune gallery in London. 
Her friend Samuel Beckett insisted that 
she show contemporary art because it 
was "a living thing." Marcel Duchamp 
taught her, as she put it, "the difference 
between Abstract and Surrealist art," and 
introduced her to the artists.' Although 
she professed ignorance about art, it is 
clear that she enjoyed an important 
advantage: since her arrival in Europe in 
1921 she had lived among intellectuals 
and artists in England and France. Her 
first husband, Laurence Vail, whom she 
married in 1922, was a Dada sculptor 
and collage artist; more important, he 
introduced her to that world. 

The first show at Guggenheim Jeune 
was a presentation of Jean Cocteau's 
drawings and furniture for his play The 
Knights of the Round Table. The British 
press mistakenly described the opening as 
a Surrealist event. Furthermore, Peggy 
had to do battle with British customs, 
which objected to the nudity in one of 
Cocteau's works. Peggy found herself the 
focus of shocked attention and 
controversy. 

That exhibition was followed, at 
Duchamp's suggestion, by the first 
showing in England of the art of Vasily 
Kandinsky. The work attracted 
considerable interest; for example, art 
schools in Gloucester and Bristol asked to 
borrow the paintings for exhibitions. 
Peggy bought a painting for herself, 
Dominant Curve, a magnificent work of 
1936 that now belongs to the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum. 

Peggy could not have predicted that 
contemporary sculptures by Jean Arp,

Constantin Brancusi, Antoine Pevsner, 
and others would be blocked in customs 
on the way from Paris for a show 
opening in April at her gallery. The 
director of the Tate Gallery, James B. 
Manson, declined to certify the sculptures 
as art. The faculty of Chelsea Polytechnic, 
which included Henry Moore and 
Graham Sutherland, wrote complaints to 
The Daily Telegraph; others accused 
Manson of Fascism (this incident took 
place only months before the Nazis" 
auctions of "degenerate art" in 
Germany), and the case was taken up in 
the House of Commons. But Peggy was 
to win, and thus, in a way directly 
parallel to the notorious trial in New 
York in 1928 over whether Brancusfs 
Bird in Space constituted a work of art, 
she had a hand in changing regulations 
and attitudes toward avant-garde art. 

Meanwhile Duchamp had introduced 
Peggy to Arp, and for sheer pleasure she 
bought from him a small, polished-brass 
sculpture, Head and Shell, which remains 



in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the 
earliest of her purchases to have survived 
her compulsive gifts. In July 1938 she 
gave Yves Tanguy an exhibition, her one 
financial success and the debut of 
Surrealism in her art career. She bought 
The Sun in Its Jewel Case (cat. no. 62) 
from her own show. Such purchases — 
sometimes made anonymously from her 
own gallery to gratify disappointed 
exhibitors — preceded Peggy's conscious 
decision to form an art collection. 

By March 1939 Peggy was tiring of her 
gallery. She had lost, she counted, £600, 
and resolved instead to open a museum 
of contemporary art in London. In a 
recent biography of Herbert Read this 
was referred to as her "whim of iron." 4 
That crucial moment points to something 
fundamental about Peggy's collection, for 
although she had bought some works as a 
consequence of Guggenheim Jeune, her 
collection was conceived as a museum. 

In view of the importance of her 
decision it is interesting to speculate how 



she came to make it. Peggy herself was 
matter-of-fact: "I felt that if I was losing 
that money I might as well lose a lot 
more and do something worthwhile." 5 
An incident that occurred twelve months 
earlier may have been in the back of her 
mind. At Kandinsky's suggestion, Peggy 
had offered to sell one of his paintings, 
Red Spot 2, to her uncle Solomon. She 
received a stinging reply from Hilla Rebay, 
Solomon's artistic adviser, chastising her 
for dealing in art under the name 
Guggenheim. Rebay also wrote, "If you 
are interested in non-objective art you 
can well afford to buy it and start a 
collection. . . . You can leave a fine 
collection to your country if you know 
how to chose [sic]." 6 

Peggy had met Read at that time; she 
supplied him with materials for an article 
on Kandinsky for The Listener. At some 
point Read showed Peggy an unpublished 
essay he had written in 1937, "Proposals 
for a Scottish Philanthropist," in which he 
envisioned a combined Bauhaus and 
Kunsthalle in Edinburgh. In 1935 he had 
been involved in a plan by Ben Nicholson 
to create a Museum of Living Art. When, 
therefore, Peggy proposed that he leave 
The Burlington Magazine, of which he 
was editor, to become director of her 
future museum, she clearly struck a chord, 
appealing to Read's idealistic belief that 
art was an antidote to war, a palliative or 
healer. Finally, it is worth remembering 
that the Museum of Modern Art in New 
York came about in 1929 through the 
alliance of three heiresses and Alfred H. 
Barr, Jr.; it is possible that Read and 
Peggy, separately, thought of themselves 
as followers of that precedent. 

Read was the best choice that Peggy 
could have made. A firm friend of Naum 



Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, Ben 
Nicholson, Roland Penrose, and the 
Surrealists ( he wrote a catalogue essay 
for their 1936 London exhibition), Read 
was a nonpartisan critic. His books, such 
as Art Now and The Meaning of Art, 
both published in the early 1930s, did 
much to open English eyes to 
contemporary European art, and they 
continue to be widely read. 

The fact that Peggy, encouraged by 
Read and Duchamp, collected Cubist, 
abstract, and Surrealist art with equal 
determination is one of the remarkable 
features of her collection: it endows it 
with a comprehensiveness, an 
encompassing quality, that no other 
collection of the time has. We owe this 
above all to Peggy's capacity to surround 
herself with extraordinarily privileged 
and well-informed advisers. To Duchamp 
and Read should be added Nellie van 
Doesburg (widow of Theo van Doesburg) 
as well as a remarkable young man by the 
name of Howard Putzel. Putzel was a 
dealer from California with a gift for 
perceiving quality and innovation in 
contemporary art. In the early 1930s he 
had promoted European art at his West 
Coast gallery. In 1938 he moved to 
Europe and befriended Peggy. 

The London museum was, however, 
ill-fated. Read wrote to Kenneth Clark 
and Penrose asking them to join Peggy 
and him as trustees. They planned to 
open the museum in Clark's house on 
Portland Place. But World War II 
intervened, and in any case Peggy did not 
feel ready. She amicably dissolved her 
contract with Read, and the funds that 
had been put aside for operating the 
museum were diverted to the purchasing 
of art. 




With a list drawn up by Read for 
what would have been the inaugural 
exhibition of the London museum — a list 
revised by Duchamp, Nellie van Doesburg, 
Putzel, and Peggy herself — Peggy brought 
together, between 1939 and 1942, while 
in London, Paris, and New York, over 
170 works of Modern European art. 
These were included in her first catalogue, 
published in 1942, to which Andre 
Breton contributed extensive research and 
an introduction. Most of those works are 
still in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. 

ART OF THIS CENTURY 
In July 1 94 1 Peggy fled Nazi-occupied 
France and returned to her native New 
York together with Max Ernst, who was 
to become her second husband, albeit 
briefly, a few months later. In October 
1942 she opened a museum-gallery at 
30 West Fifty-seventh Street in New York

City and called it Art of This Century. 
The opening party was the occasion for a 
symbolic gesture: Peggy wore one earring 
created by Alexander Calder and one by 
Tanguy to demonstrate her impartiality 
between abstraction and Surrealism. This 
combining of the disparate trends was 
also manifest in the design of the gallery 
itself and in the installation of her 
collection. 

Peggy had entrusted the project to 
Frederick Kiesler, the Austrian-American 
architect and sculptor. Kiesler, drawing 
on ideas that had been germinating since 
1 924, set out to unify the work of art 
with its spatial environment and to 
eliminate the barrier between the world

of the object and that of the viewer 
(embodied most obviously in the picture 
frame, which he and Peggy banned from 
the installation). His solution was 
startling and quickly made Art of This 
Century the most exciting venue in New 
York for seeing contemporary art. The 
Cubist and abstract art was displayed in a 
blue-floored room with undulating blue 
canvas covering its walls. Paintings were 
hung on triangular suspension columns. 
The floating and transparent effect 
approximated the pictorial space we 
associate with Cubist and abstract 
painting. In the next gallery Surrealist art 
works hung on jointed wooden spokes, 



extruding from curved wood walls. A 
wire recording of the roar of an express 
train added an element of terror, while 
the lighting system, which turned on and 
off at regular intervals in the tunnel-like 
space, was intended to give the sensation 
of the pulse of one's own blood. 
Biomorphic wooden furniture, designed 
and even constructed by Kiesler, doubled 
as both chairs and bases for art in these 
galleries. 

A third gallery was designed to display 
Peggy's paintings by Paul Klee, one work 
by Breton, and Duchamp's Box in a 
Valise. Seven paintings by Klee were 
placed on a revolving wheel, which was 
set in motion when a visitor passed in 
front of an electric eye. The visitor looked 
through a peephole to view the Valise, 
which contained Duchamp's oeuvre

complete in miniature, and turned the 
large, spidery wheel to bring each of its 
images into view. Peggy was the 
unwitting purveyor of a premonition of 
Duchamp's last work, Etant donnes (now 
in the collection of the Philadelphia 
Museum of Art), which places the viewer 
in a similarly voyeuristic posture. Peggy 
wrote, "The press named this part of the 
gallery Coney Island."" Temporary 
exhibitions of work by the European 
avant-garde and young Americans took 
place in another gallery. 

JACKSON POLLOCK 
The thirty-two-year-old Jackson Pollock 
was introduced to Peggy in the spring of 
1943 by Putzel, although it may have 
been Piet Mondrian who convinced her 
of Pollock's exceptional talent. In July 
1943 P e ggy began helping Pollock with 
monthly payments, enabling him to 
dedicate himself solely to painting. (She 
was to continue doing so until 1948.) 
Peggy's influence on Pollock's life was 
manifold. Before her support he had 
rarely exhibited, let alone sold any 
paintings. She spurred him to new 
challenges — beginning with collage and 
going on to Mural of December 1943, his 
largest work, which she commissioned 
for her house (now in the collection of 
the Museum of Art of the University of 
Iowa). In November 1943 she gave 
Pollock his first solo exhibition, which 
included The Moon Woman (cat. no. 73), 
an early painting still in the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection. James Johnson 
Sweeney wrote an enthusiastic preface to 
the catalogue of the show and Clement 
Greenberg immediately began placing 
him in the historical context of American 
art. Barr later bought from Peggy The

She-Wolf for the Museum of Modern Art; 
it was the first Pollock to enter a public 
collection. Furthermore, the presence of 
Peggy's paintings at Art of This Century 
was in itself a stimulus, the Picassos and 
Miros directly influencing Pollock's 
production. 

Guided by Putzel, Peggy gave exhibi- 
tions to several other emerging American 
artists: William Baziotes, David Hare, 
Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, and 
Clyfford Still, for example. Americans 
were able to see work by the European 
avant-garde in Peggy's gallery and some- 
times to meet the artists themselves at 
Peggy's New York house. In this way 
Peggy nurtured Abstract Expressionism 
and forged links between European art, 
whether Surrealist or abstract, and the 
new generation of Americans. The impact 
of Art of This Century and Peggy

Guggenheim on the New York scene was 
such that her collection takes on the char- 
acter of a historical document. It can be 
seen as a piece of history — both as a 
record of events in New York between 
1942 and 1947 and as a force acting to 
influence them. 8 

VENICE 

In 1947 Peggy resolved to return to 
Europe. She convinced Betty Parsons to 
take on Pollock at her gallery, and went 
to Venice in search of a house. On the 
invitation of Rodolfo Pallucchini she 
displayed her collection at the 1948 
Venice Biennale. In this way the works of 
artists such as Arshile Gorky, Pollock, 
and Rothko were exhibited for the first 
time in Europe. 9 The presence of Cubist, 
abstract, and Surrealist art made the 
Greek Pavilion, where her collection was 
installed, the most coherent survey of 
Modernism to have been presented 
anywhere in Italy to date. Peggy was 
flattered by the attention she was

receiving. In 194 1 she had left Europe 
anonymously as a private and arguably 
eccentric person. By 1947 she had 
become a celebrity. 

In 1949 Peggy bought the unfinished 
Palazzo Venier dei Leoni: a long, wide 
building with only a basement and 
ground floor, on the Grand Canal near 
the Salute. Begun in the mid-eighteenth 
century by architect Lorenzo Boschetti, it 
was left unfinished probably because of 
litigation with a neighboring family, 
whose Gothic palace suffered structural 
damage during building at the Palazzo 
Venier. 10 The nickname dei Leoni refers to 
the outsize stone lion heads on the 
facade, and gave rise to the legend that a 
lion was once kept in the garden. The 
building may have been made habitable 
only in this century. In the 1910s and

1920s Marchesa Casati, muse of Gabriele 
D'Annunzio and hostess to the Ballets 
Russes, threw parties in the palazzo. 
Peggy bought it from the heirs of Doris 
Viscountess Castlerosse, who lived there 
in the late 1930s. 

After the Venice Biennale, Peggy was 
invited to travel her collection to the 
Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and the 
Palazzo Reale in Milan. In 1950 she 
showed her entire collection of eighteen 
paintings by Pollock (as well as two 
others that she had already given to the 



Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam) at the 
Museo Correr, Venice. This coincided 
with Pollock's debut in the U.S. Pavilion 
at the Venice Biennale, but only three 
works by him were shown there — 
preeminence was accorded instead to an 
older artist, John Marin. As in 1948 
Peggy proved herself to be a generation 
ahead of the Biennale. 

She wrote that seeing Pollock's 
paintings through the windows of the 
Museo Correr from Piazza San Marco 
confirmed to her the greatness of his 
work. She later came to regret her 
numerous donations to art museums 
around the world, which she had made to 
promote the appreciation of Pollock's 



'" 



work and that of other Abstract 
Expressionists whose work she had 
collected." 

Peggy was to live the rest of her life in 
Venice, where she finally realized her 
ambition to open a museum of 
contemporary art. She continued to buy 
art from time to time; the postwar 
European art in her collection testifies to 
this. Her patronage of artists focused on 
two young Venetian abstract painters, 
Tancredi and Edmondo Bacci. By the 
early 1960s, however, her distaste for Pop 
art, as well as the steeply rising prices of 
contemporary art, brought her collecting 
to an end. She became interested above 
all in the presentation of the major 
movements so majestically represented in 
her collection — Cubism, European 
abstraction, Surrealism, and early 
Abstract Expressionism — and she became 
anxious to find a way to guarantee the 
future of the museum she had created. 

THE SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM 
FOUNDATION 

Peggy enthusiastically lent her collection 
to other museums, among them the 
Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1950), 
the Kunsthaus Zurich (19 51), the Tate 
Gallery, London (1964), the Moderna 
Museet, Stockholm, and the Louisiana 
Museum, Humlebaek, Denmark (both 
1966), and the Civica Galleria d'Arte 
Moderna, Turin (1967). In the catalogue 
of her collection when it was shown at 
the Orangerie in Paris in 1974, Peggy 
wrote of her pleasure at seeing her 
paintings and sculptures installed in a 
museum environment. 

In 1969 the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum invited Peggy to exhibit her 
collection in New York, and it was on 



this occasion that she resolved to donate 
her palazzo and art collection to the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. 
She wrote, "I was like someone who was 
longing to be proposed to by someone 
who was longing to marry her." ,2 She 
asked only that the collection remain in 
Venice and continue to be opened to the 
public during the summers. Although the 
gift was accomplished during Peggy 
Guggenheim's lifetime, it was not until 
her death at the end of 1979 that the 
foundation established by her uncle took 
on the management and full 
responsibility for the collection. " 
The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Foundation dates from 1937, and in 1939 
Solomon's museum, directed by Hilla 
Rebay, opened in New York as the 
Museum of Non-Objective Painting. 
Solomon died in 1949, and the museum 
was renamed in his memory in 1952. 
Frank Lloyd Wright's famous spiral struc- 
ture on Fifth Avenue opened in 1959, and 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has 
been housed there ever since. The founda- 
tion now operates two museums in 
Manhattan (the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum and the Guggenheim Museum 
S0H0) and the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection in Venice. Although the 
Guggenheim collections were formed 
independently, they nevertheless contain 
many comparable works by the same key 
figures of twentieth-century art. Together 
the Guggenheim collections form one of 
the most important holdings of Modern 
art in the world.

PLATE I 



PABLO PICASSO 



The Poet 

(Le Poete) 

August 191 1 

Oil on linen canvas, 13 1.2 x 89.5 cm 

76.2553 pg 1 



Like The Accordionist in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, The 
Poet was painted during the summer of 191 1, when Pablo Picasso was working in close 
association with Georges Braque in the French Pyrenees town of Ceret. Similar in style 
and composition to Braque's contemporaneous Man with a Guitar (Collection The 
Museum of Modern Art, New York), this canvas epitomizes the moment in the 
development of Analytic Cubism when the degree of abstraction was so extreme that 
objects in the painting are almost unrecognizable. 

As the title indicates, it is the human form that has been visually dissected and 
reconstructed as an architecture of rectilinear and curvilinear elements. Despite the 
elusiveness of the visual clues, the viewer can detect a densely articulated central 
pyramidal figure fused coloristically and texturally with the less detailed ground. The 
small circle at the upper center of the canvas penetrated by the acme of a triangular 
plane becomes an eye when associated with the longer, broader plane of a possible nose 
and the crescents of a probable mustache. Once this recognition occurs, a complete 
image can be reconstituted by the inference of chin, pipe, neck, attenuated torso, 
elbows, and chair arms. 

Picasso presents multiple views of each object, as if he had moved around it, and 
synthesizes them into a single compound image. The fragmentation of the image 
encourages a reading of abstract rather than representational form. The imagined 
volumes of figure and object dissolve into non-objective organizations of line, plane, 
light, and color. Interpenetrating facets of forms floating in a shallow, indeterminate 
space are defined and shaded by luminous, hatched, almost Neo-Impressionist 
brushstrokes. The continuity of certain lines through these facets creates an illusion of a 
system of larger planes that also float in this indefinite space yet are securely anchored 
within an architectonic structure. The chromatic sobriety characteristic of works by 
Picasso and Braque of this period corresponds with the cerebral nature of the issues 
they address. (L.F.) 



PLATE 2 



PABLO PICASSO 

Pipe, Glass, Bottle of Vieux Marc 

(Pipe, verre, bouteille de Vieux Marc) 

Spring 19 14 

Paper collage, charcoal, india ink, printer's ink, graphite, and gouache on canvas, 

73.2 x 59.4 cm 

76.2553 PG 2 

After fragmenting representational form almost to the point of extinction in 191 1 
(see plate 1), the following year Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque reintroduced more 
legible imagery, usually derived from the environment of studio or cafe. Without 
abandoning all devices of Analytic Cubism, they developed a new idiom, referred to as 
Synthetic Cubism, in which they built their compositions with broader, flatter, and 
chromatically more varied planes. In the summer of 19 12 Braque produced the first 
papier colle, in which cut paper is glued to the support and used as a compositional 
element. In the present example Picasso's pasted papers include printed material — a 
piece of wallpaper and the January 1, 1914, issue of Lacerba, a Futurist magazine 
founded in Florence in 1913. These elements mimic their functions in the external 
world and therefore introduce a new level of reality into the picture. The printed papers 
appear to be integrated into the pictorial space rather than lying flat on the surface. A 
transparent plane outlined in chalk appears to penetrate the newspaper and the guitar 
seems to cast a shadow on it; the actual physical presence of the wallpaper is similarly 
contradicted by the addition of drawing. 

The treatment of other collaged papers multiplies meaning. In the case of the pipe or 
table leg, the cutout itself defines the contour of the object and is modeled accordingly 
with chalk. Penciled indications of other objects, such as the guitar or glass, ignore the 
shape of the pasted paper, which acts as both a support and a compositional element. 
The opacity of the collage materials is refuted and the transparency of the object 
depicted is upheld when Picasso discloses parts of the guitar behind the glass. On the 
other hand, a piece of Lacerba remains visible through the guitar, which in reality is 
opaque. Not only does each object have a multiple nature, but its relations in space to 
other objects are changeable and contradictory. The table assuredly occupies a space 
between the wall and the picture plane; its collaged corner overlaps a portion of 
wallpaper and its visible leg obscures part of a baseboard molding. Yet the depth of this 
space is indeterminate, as the tabletop has reared up so that it is parallel to the picture 
plane. The respective situations in space of the still-life subjects are equally equivocal — 
the silhouette of the bottle of Vieux Marc simultaneously obscures and is obscured by 
the guitar. (L.F.) 



PLATE 3 



PABLO PICASSO 



The Studio 

(L' Atelier) 

1928 

Oil and black crayon on canvas, 161. 6 x 129.9 cm 

76.2553 pg 3 



From 1927 to 1929 Pablo Picasso elaborated a complex discourse on the activity of the 
artist through the theme of the studio. Among the variations in the series, the closest 
to the present example is The Studio of 1927-28 (Collection The Museum of Modern 
Art, New York; repr. Rudenstine, p. 620, fig. c). Both works share the vivid palette of 
Synthetic Cubism, limited to draw attention to a conspicuous and authoritative 
execution in planar areas. This painterliness contrasts with the geometrized, wirelike 
contours that define the figures in the manner of Picasso's contemporaneous wire 
sculpture. 

The figures in the Guggenheim The Studio can be identified as a sculptured bust 
(at the left) and a full-length painted portrait (to the right). By depicting artistic 
representations of humans in a highly schematized form, Picasso places the figures at 
several removes from the world of living beings. He relies on the viewer's willingness 
to believe in the reality of depicted objects, however abstract, and to imagine a human 
exchange or relationship between the male and female forms. Like the artist in the 
Museum of Modern Art version, the bust has three eyes; this may reflect Picasso's 
personal identification with the work of art. 

Picasso's development of the theme of the artist's perception of himself and his 
subjects can be traced from his etching of 1927 Painter with a Model Knitting, in which 
a realistically drawn artist paints a fantastic and abstract portrait of a very ordinary 
woman. The artist becomes an abstract sign in The Studio at the Museum of Modern 
Art and disappears, or is at least submerged, in The Studio in the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection. He reappears in Painter and Model, also of 1928 (Collection The Museum of 
Modern Art, New York), as a figure that is even more difficult to detect, yet nonetheless 
is engaged in painting a relatively realistic profile. The theme of the interaction of reality 
and illusion explored here was a central concern for Picasso throughout his life. ( L. F. )

PABLO PICASSO 



On the Beach 

(La Baignade) 

February 12, 1937 

Oil, conte crayon, and chalk on canvas, 129.1 x 194 cm 

76.2553 pg 5 



During the early months of 1937 Pablo Picasso was responding powerfully to the 
Spanish Civil War with the preparatory drawings for Guernica (Collection Museo 
Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid) and with etchings such as The Dream 
and Lie of Franco, an example of which is in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. 
However, in this period he also executed a group of works that do not betray this 
preoccupation with political events. The subject of On the Beach, also known as Girls 
with a Toy Boat, specifically recalls Picasso's Three Bathers of 1920 (Collection Stephen 
Hahn, New York). Painted at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre near Versailles, On the Beach is 
one of several paintings in which he returns to the ossified, volumetric forms in beach 
environments that appeared in his works of the late 1920s and early 1930s. On the 
Beach can be compared with Henri Matisse's Le Luxe, II, ca. 1907-08 (Collection 
Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen), in its simplified, planar style and in the poses 
of the foreground figures. It is plausible that the arcadian themes of his friendly rival 
Matisse would appeal to Picasso as an alternative to the violent images of war he was 
conceiving at the time. 

At least two preparatory drawings have been identified for this work. In one 
(Collection Musee Picasso, Paris; repr. Rudenstine, p. 625), the male figure looming on 
the horizon has a sinister appearance. In the other drawing (present whereabouts 
unknown), 1 as in the finished version, his mien is softened and neutralized to correspond 
with the features of the two female figures. The sense of impotent voyeurism conveyed 
as he gazes at the fertile, exaggeratedly sexual "girls" calls to mind the myth of Diana 
caught unawares at her bath. (L. F.)

PLATE 5 



GEORGES BRAQUE 



The Clarinet 

(La Clarinette) 

Summer-fall 19 12 

Oil with sand on oval canvas, 91.4 x 64.5 cm 

76.2553 PG 7 



The Clarinet was probably executed in the late summer of 19 12, during the waning 
moments of Analytic Cubism. Characteristic of this period are the oval format, which 
frees the canvas from the stringencies of corners, the appearance of letters within the 
image, and the use of imitation wood grain as trompe l'oeil (a technique Georges 
Braque introduced into the Cubist repertory). The image is paler and less strongly 
articulated than that of Pablo Picasso's The Poet of the previous summer (plate 1); the 
structure of planes is more compact and produces a shallower picture space. The 
planes, because they are more consistently parallel to the picture plane than before, 
suggest the flat surfaces of papier colle. Braque's incorporation of sand into certain 
areas of his pigment, an innovation of this transitional period, enhances the 
differentiation of surfaces created by the variations of brushstrokes and increases the 
subtleties of coloration. The use of sand accords with Braque's conviction that tactile 
qualities define space. Despite this emphasis on materiality the image remains 
evanescent. The paradoxical combination of tangible presence and elusive, palpitating 
abstraction is embodied in the contrasting handling of clarinet and guitar: the clarinet 
is shown almost complete, the guitar is fragmented into pieces that emerge here and 
there throughout the composition. (L. F.) 



PLATE 6 



GEORGES BRAQUE 



The Bowl of Grapes 

(Le Compotier de raisins) 

1926 

Oil with pebbles and sand on canvas, 100 x 80.8 cm 

76.2553 pg 8 



After his return from military service in 19 17 Georges Braque, working independently 
of Pablo Picasso, developed the subjects and style of his prewar period. His use of 
collage in the teens provided formal innovations in paintings of the twenties. In still 
lifes such as the present example, he constructed objects with broad, frontal planes that 
remain discrete and are often vividly colored or decoratively patterned. 

In subject matter, The Bowl of Grapes belongs to Braque's gueridon (round pedestal 
table) and mantelpiece series of about 191 8 to 1929. It displays a rigorous and complex 
organization of shape and line combined with the sensuous appeal of rich color (three 
greens contrasted with chalky white and tan) and a masterful handling of paint. The 
structuring grid is softened by broad curves and clusters of circular forms, and in 
peripheral areas enriched by the textural variation provided by the addition of sand 
to pigment. 

Formal rather than illusionistic needs govern the treatment of objects. The white 
drapery does not cascade down from the tabletop in foreshortened, shadowed folds, but 
rigidly asserts itself parallel to the picture plane. The distinction between lit and 
shadowed sides of the pitcher is artificially sharp. Reminiscent of Paul Cezanne's still 
lifes are the heavy contours and voluminous presence of the objects, the tilted planes, 
inconsistent perspective, and discontinuous background lines. (L.F.) 



PLATE 7 



JUAN GRIS 

Bottle of Rum and Newspaper 

(bouteille de rhum et journal) 

June 1914 

Paper collage, gouache, conte crayon, and pencil on newspaper, mounted on canvas, 

54.8 x 46.2 cm 
76.2553 PG II 

In 191 3 Juan Gris began using the technique of papier colle developed by Georges 
Braque and Pablo Picasso, with whom he had been working in close contact since 
191 1. By 1914 Gris's handling of the technique was personal and sophisticated, as 
evidenced by works such as Bottle of Rum and Newspaper, executed in Paris shortly 
before he left for Collioure at the end of June. Here the pasted elements overlap and 
intermesh with one another in relationships calculated with mathematical rigor. These 
collaged papers cover the entire surface of the canvas, simultaneously forming an 
abstract composition and serving as a multilayered support for naturalistic details. 

The dynamism of the picture derives from the tension between horizontals, verticals, 
and thrusting diagonals. Gris presents the table as if it were viewed from several 
vantage points at once, demonstrating that a diagonal can be understood as a 
horizontal perceived from an oblique angle, and also suggesting the movement of the 
observer or artist around objects. The telescoping of a number of viewpoints in a single 
image produces the illusion of a spatial dislocation of the objects themselves. Dissected 
parts of the bottle of rum, recognizable by correspondence of shape or by labeling, float 
beside, below, or above the drawing of the complete bottle. These paper cutouts, at 
once more tangible and more fragmented than the shadowy outline, confuse one's 
perceptions of the bottle's presence. 

Gris confounds expectations of the nature of materials. He usually depicts the glass 
objects as transparent and the others as opaque but does not hesitate to betray this 
faithfulness to the properties of objects when formal demands intercede. (L. F.) 



PLATE 



JEAN METZINGER 



At the Cycle-Race Track 

(Au Velodrome) 

Ca. 1914 (?) 

Oil and collage on canvas, 130.4 x 97.1 cm 

76.2553 pg 18 



Jean Metzinger, a sensitive and intelligent theoretician of Cubism, sought to 
communicate the principles of this movement through his paintings as well as his 
writings. Devices of Cubism and Futurism appear in At the Cycle-Race Track, though 
they are superimposed on an image that is essentially naturalistic. Cubist elements 
include printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface, and the use of 
transparent planes to define space. The choice of a subject in motion, the suggestion of 
velocity, and the fusing of forms find parallels in Futurist painting. Though these 
devices are handled with some awkwardness and the influence of Impressionism 
persists, particularly in the use of dots of color to represent the crowd in the 
background, this work represents Metzinger's attempt to come to terms with a new 
pictorial language. (L.F.) 



PLATE 9 



ALBERT GLEIZES 

Woman with Animals (Madame Raymond DuchAxMP-Villon 

(La Dame aux betes [Madame Raymond Duchamp-Villon] ) 

Completed by February 19 14 

Oil on canvas, 196.4 x 114.1 cm 

76.2553 pg 17 



As in a number of his other paintings of this period, Albert Gleizes depicts a domestic 
interior scene in a self-consciously "modern" style. Here the seated woman is the wife 
of Raymond Duchamp-Villon, the sculptor who took part in the discussions of the 
Cubist group at Puteaux during the early teens. She is portrayed as the epitome of 
bourgeois complacency, in a large armchair, with her dog and two cats, sensible tie 
shoe, wedding band, and string of beads. Typically Cubist elements are the fusion of 
figure and ground, the frontal, centralized pose, the multiple views of the sitter's face, 
the choppy brushstrokes defining and shading planes, and the patterning of areas to 
resemble collage. Futurist devices are the repetition of form to describe movement (the 
dog's wagging tail) and planar intersections and force lines meant to express notions of 
the dynamic interpenetration of matter and atmosphere. (L. F.)

FERNAND LEGER 



Men in the City 
[Les Hommes dans la ville) 

1919 

Oil on canvas, 145.7 x 113. 5 cm 

76.2553 pg 21 



Fernand Leger temporarily abandoned representational depiction in his Contrast of 
Forms series of 19 13-14, begun a few months after he completed Nude Model in the 
Studio (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York). When he returned 
from the front in 19 17 and resumed painting, he reintroduced recognizable imagery in 
his work. Responsive to the technological advances and assertive advertising that 
followed World War I, he embarked on his "mechanical" period with works such as 
Men in the City and the related The City of 1919-29 (Collection Philadelphia 
Museum of Art). 

In the urban themes of this period the human figure becomes as de-individualized 
and mechanized as the environment it occupies. Leger is able to express the rhythmic 
energy of contemporary life by finding its pictorial equivalent. Form, color, and shape 
are considered primarily for their plastic values and are given equal emphasis. They 
confront one another in a multitude of relations, creating single images that capture 
simultaneous sensations. Confusion of parts does not result, because Leger distributes 
planes evenly and builds his compositions with blocky areas of flat, easily read, 
unmixed color and clear and incisive outline. He conveys a sense of depth through 
overlapping planes and changes in scale rather than with modeling. Leger's simple, 
varied, and clear pictorial elements, like ideal machines, efficiently produce effects of 
maximum power. (L.F.)

LOUIS MARCOUSSIS 



The Regular 

(L'Habitue) 

1920 

Oil with sand and pebbles on canvas, 161. 9 x 97 cm 

76.2553 pg 22 



In this Synthetic Cubist work of 1920 Louis Marcoussis presents a hieratic figure 
immobilized by habit, so much a part of his environment that he is barely distinguishable 
from it. Familiar Cubist motifs and effects are integrated in a strong, complex 
composition in which abstract and representational elements are harmonized. Sand, 
stippled paint, and imitation wood grain lend texture to the broad, angular planes that 
organize the picture space. The large proportions of the canvas increase the impact of the 
architectonic structure of planes. Blocks of color echo and respond to one another to 
establish balanced relationships over the entire surface. 

The limits of abstraction are tested in the treatment of the figure, which would not be 
recognizable without the humanizing details indicating face and head — the schematic 
eyes, nose, mustache, furrowed brow, cigar, and hat. The right hand is merely a strip of 
modulated cylinders, the left only slightly more articulated with fingernails. The only 
naturalistically described objects are the dominoes on the table, which, unlike the 
human form, would be unidentifiable if they were distorted. Like letters, they are signs 
with unchangeable meanings that can be combined in various ways to produce larger 
meanings. Similarly, parts of a Cubist picture have an intrinsic, independent significance 
that is expanded and complicated when they are related within an ordered composition.

76.2553 pg 27 



Henri Laurens, who associated closely with the avant-garde painters of his native Paris, 
worked in a Cubist idiom from 191 5. In about 1920 he turned from the production of 
bas-reliefs and frontalized constructions to the execution of more classically ordered, 
freestanding sculptures. Head of a Young Girl may have appeared originally as a 
drawing (see, for example, Head of 19 17, Collection Mr. and Mrs. Irving W. Rabb, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts). However, in this bust Laurens expresses Cubist painting 
principles in essentially sculptural terms. The tilted surfaces and geometric volumes of 
the sculpture interpenetrate to constitute a compact whole. Circling the piece, the 
viewer perceives dramatically different aspects of the head, which provide a variety of 
visual experiences unexpected in a form so schematically reduced. 

The structuring planes of one side of the head are broad and unadorned; its edges 
and planar junctures form strong, uninterrupted curves and straight lines. The other 
side is articulated with detail; its jagged, hewn contour describing hair contrasts 
rhythmically with the sweeping curve of the opposite cheek. Laurens slices into the 
polyhedron that determines the facial planes to describe nose, upper lip, and chin at 
one stroke. The subtle modeling, particularly of the almond eye and simplified mouth, 
produces nuanced relations of light and shadow. Despite the geometric clarity of 
structure, the delicacy of the young girl's features and her self-contained pose create a 
gentle, meditative quality. (L.F.)

JACQUES LIPCHITZ 



Seated Pierrot

Lead, 33.5 cm high, including base 

76.2553 PG28 



In 1 916 Jacques Lipchitz became a close friend of Juan Gris, who inspired him to paint 
his only completed Cubist oil the following year. Gris, in turn, made a foray into 
sculpture with his polychromed plaster Harlequin, 19 17 (Collection Philadelphia 
Museum of Art), executed with the technical guidance of Lipchitz. Seated Pierrot is 
stylistically close to the Gris sculpture in its squat, massive proportions and the 
synthesis of angular and curvilinear elements. 

By applying an ambiguous formal vocabulary in Seated Pierrot, Lipchitz has been 
able to fuse two recurrent Cubist themes — the commedia delParte figure of Pierrot and 
the still life. The figure's head and neck echo the similarly bifurcated shape of bottle 
neck and lip in certain of his bas-reliefs. The circular eyes recall the stylized mouth of a 
bottle; the encircling arms form a recessed oval like that of a compotier; and the 
configuration of legs and feet resembles the distorted glasses of Cubist painting. These 
volumes interpenetrate in apparent contradiction to the solidity of the sculptural form. 
The Cubist exchange of solid for void is wittily effected in the positive-negative 
handling of the two eyes. Lipchitz's concern with the effects of light is evident in the 
contrast between broad, deeply shadowed areas and dappled planes animated by 
surface texture. (L. F.)

ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO 



Boxing 
(La Boxe)

Terra-cotta, 76.6 cm high 

76.2553 pg 26 



Two plaster versions of this work were made from the same mold in 19 13-14 (see 
Rudenstine, p. 55). One of these, known as Struggle, is in the collection of the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the second was given by the artist's widow to the 
Saarland Museum, Saarbriicken (Rudenstine, p. 56, fn. 6). The Peggy Guggenheim 
terra-cotta, though very similar to the original plasters, is slightly larger and was executed 
many years later. 

Alexander Archipenko disavowed the influence of Cubism on his geometric 
simplification of form. However, one of his most important contributions to Modern 
sculpture, the breaking up of monolithic form with open spaces, finds its counterpart in 
the Cubist exchange of solid and void. He also shares with the Cubists an interest in the 
analysis of space and the interpenetration of planes within it. 

The artist explains the choice of subject for this work in a poetic inscription at its 
base: "'la boxe' — C'est la musique monumental [sic] des volumes d'espace [sic] et de la 
matiere. ..." (Boxing — the monumental music of volumes of space and of material). 
The thrusting figures of the two contenders are joined inextricably in opposition, 
forming an aggressively charged sculptural whole. Apart from the work of the Italian 
Futurists, few sculptures of this period combine radical essentialization of form with 
virile, assertive dynamism in the manner of Boxing. Another is Raymond Duchamp- 
Villon's The Horse (plate 15), executed some months after the original version of the 
Archipenko was completed. (L. F.)

RAYMOND DUCH AMP-VILLON 



The Horse 

(Le Cheval) 

1914 (cast ca. 1930) 

Bronze, 43.6 x 41 cm 

76.2553 pg 24 



Raymond Duchamp-Villon began work on the plaster original of The Horse, a 
composite image of an animal and machine, in 1914, finishing it on leaves from 
military duty in the fall. It was preceded by numerous sketches and by several other 
versions initiated in 1913. The original conception did not include the machine and was 
relatively naturalistic, as is evident in the early states of the small Horse and Rider of 
1 9 14. Duchamp-Villon then developed an increasingly dynamic, smooth-surfaced, and 
geometric synthesis of horse and machine. The Peggy Guggenheim version is highly 
abstract and parts of the horse's physiognomy are replaced by machine elements. 
Nonetheless, echoes of the original pose remain. As in the second state of Horse and 
Rider (Collection Judith Riklis, New York), the animal appears to be gathering its 
hooves, summoning strength to jump. Duchamp-Villon closely observed the dynamics 
of the movement of horses during his experience in the cavalry; he also studied the 
subject in the late nineteenth-century photographic experiments of Eadweard 
Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey. 

With a handful of other sculptors, such as Alexander Archipenko, Umberto 
Boccioni, and Constantin Brancusi, Duchamp-Villon overturned conventional 
representation of form to suggest instead its inner forces. He associated these forces 
with the energy of the machine. The visual movement of the pistons, wheels, and shafts 
of this sculpture turns a creature of nature into a poised mechanical dynamo. The 
fusion of the horse, traditional symbol of power, and the machine that was replacing it 
reflects the emerging awareness of the new technological age. 

The entire series was cast in bronze after the artist's death.' (L. F.)

MARCEL DUCHAMP 



Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train 
(nu [esquisse], jeune homme triste dans un train) 

19II-H 

Oil on cardboard, 100 x 73 cm 
76.2553 PG9 



This painting, which Marcel Duchamp identified as a self-portrait, was probably begun 
during December of 19 11 in Neuilly, while he was exploring ideas for the controversial 
Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 of 19 12 (Collection Philadelphia Museum of Art; 
see Rudenstine, pp. 265-6 6 ). In Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train his transitory 
though acute interest in Cubism is manifested in the subdued palette, emphasis on the 
flat surface of the picture plane, and in the subordination of representational fidelity to 
the demands of the abstract composition. 

Duchamp's primary concern in this painting is the depiction of two movements, 
that of the train in which we observe the young man smoking and that of the lurching 
figure itself. The forward motion of the train is suggested by the multiplication of the 
lines and volumes of the figure, a semitransparent form through which we can see 
windows, themselves transparent and presumably presenting a blurred, "moving" 
landscape. The independent sideways motion of the figure is represented by a 
directionally contrary series of repetitions. These two series of replications suggest the 
multiple images of chronophotography, which Duchamp acknowledged as an influence, 
and the related ideas of the Italian Futurists, of which he was at least aware by this 
time. Here he uses the device not only to illustrate movement, but also to integrate the 
young man with his murky surroundings, which with his swaying, drooping pose 
contribute to the air of melancholy. Shortly after the execution of this and similar 
works, Duchamp lost interest in Cubism and developed his eccentric vocabulary of 
mechanomorphic elements that foreshadowed aspects of Dada. (L. F.)

GIACOMO BALLA

(Velocita astratta + rumore) 

1913-14 

Oil on board, 54.5 x 76.5 cm, including artist's painted frame 

76.2553 pg 31 



In late 19 12 to early 19 13 Giacomo Balla turned from a depiction of the splintering of 
light to the exploration of movement and, more specifically, the speed of racing 
automobiles. This led to an important series of studies in 1913-14. The choice of 
automobile as symbol of abstract speed recalls Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's notorious 
statement in his first Futurist manifesto, published on February 20, 1909, in he Figaro 
in Paris, only a decade after the first Italian car was manufactured: "The world's 
splendor has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed ... A roaring 
automobile . . . that seems to run on shrapnel, is more beautiful than the Victory of 
Samothrace." 

It has been proposed that Abstract Speed + Sound was the central section of a 
narrative triptych suggesting the alteration of landscape by the passage of a car through 
the atmosphere. 1 The related Abstract Speed (present whereabouts unknown; formerly 
Collection Dr. W. Loeffler, Zurich) and Abstract Speed — The Car Has Passed (Collection 
Tate Gallery, London) would have been the flanking panels. Indications of sky and a 
single landscape are present in the three paintings; the interpretation of fragmented 
evocations of the car's speed varies from panel to panel. The Peggy Guggenheim work is 
distinguished by crisscross motifs, representing sound, and a multiplication of the 
number of lines and planes. 

The original frames of all three panels were painted with continuations of the forms 
and colors of the compositions, implying the overflow of the paintings' reality into the 
spectator's own space. Many other studies and variations by Balla on the theme of a 
moving automobile in the same landscape exist. (L. F.)

Umberto Boccioni turned to sculpture in 19 12 after publishing his manifesto on the 
subject on April 1 1 of that year. The Futurist aesthetic platform as articulated in this 
document advocates the use of various materials in a single work, the rejection of 
closed form, and the suggestion of the interpenetration of form and the environment 
through the device of intersecting planes. In Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses 
Boccioni assembled wood, cardboard, and metal, with painted areas showing a Futurist 
handling of planes influenced by the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. 
Ironically, his intention of preserving "unique forms" caught in space and time is 
mocked by the perishability of his materials — the work has been considerably restored 
and continues to present conservation problems (see Rudenstine, pp. 99-106). 

Boccioni, like Raymond Duchamp-Villon (see plate 15), made studies of horses from 
nature before developing the motif into a nonspecific symbol of the modern age. This 
fully evolved symbol appears in Boccioni's painting The City Rises of 19 10 (Collection 
The Museum of Modern Art, New York). In Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses 
he used the horse to demonstrate his observation that the nature of vision produces the 
illusion of a fusing of forms. When the distance between a galloping horse and a 
stationary house is visually imperceptible, horse and house appear to merge into a single 
changing form. Sculptures such as the present example are concerned with the apparent 
compression of space as an object traverses it, and with the nature of the object's 
redefinition by that space. 

In 191 3 and 1914 Boccioni made many drawings and watercolors related to the 
present work that explore the relationship between a galloping horse and a group of 
houses in close proximity (see Rudenstine, pp. 107-08). In some of these studies the 
speed of the horse's motion serves to dissolve the legs below the muscles of the shanks. 
Boccioni's original conception of the sculpture gave forceful expression to this concept.

GINO SEVERIN 



Sea=Dancer 

(Mare= Ballerina) 

January 1914 

Oil on canvas, 105.3 x 85.9 cm, including artist's painted frame 

76.2553 pg 3 z 



Toward the end of 19 13, after he left Paris for Pienza and Rome, Gino Severini traveled 
to coastal Anzio for reasons of health. It was after arriving there that he executed 
Sea-Dancer. This painting, in which the sea and a figure are equated, illustrates his 
notions of "plastic analogies" as outlined in a manifesto he prepared for his solo 
exhibition at the Marlborough Gallery in London in 191 3. According to Severini, the 
environment is optically determined and hence fluid, and the human figure is merely a 
part, albeit an inseparable part, of that metamorphic reality. In this canvas and others 
the cadences of the swirling motion of the dance and the dancer's costume are 
compared with those of the sea's movement. The large curling planes are stippled with 
brilliant staccato dabs of paint that cause all surfaces to vibrate as if with light. As in 
many other Futurist paintings (see plate 17), the image spills over onto the frame. The 
divisionist brushstroke derives from Giacomo Balla and ultimately from the Neo- 
Impressionists, particularly Georges Seurat. Works such as Sea-Dancer may have a 
specific source in Seurat's he Cbahut of 1889-90 (Collection Rijksmuseum Kroller- 
Muller, Otterlo).' 

The play of cylindrical and flat planes in this painting brings to mind the 
contemporaneous Cubism of Fernand Leger, though the color is closer to the prismatic 
hues of Robert Delaunay. However, the absence of outline and the dissolution of 
volume distinguish Severini's work. During this period Severini's analogies of forms 
divest objects of their usual identities; later in 19 14 he would produce entirely non- 
objective compositions. (L. F.)

Oil on oval canvas, 57 x 123 cm 

76.2553 PG 36 



Though Robert Delaunay had virtually discarded representational imagery by the 
spring of 19 12 when he embarked on the Windows theme, vestigial objects endure in 
this series. Here, as in Simultaneous Windows 2nd Motif, ist Part (Collection Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum, New York) of the same moment, the centralized ghost of a 
green Eiffel Tower alludes to his enthusiasm for modern life. 

Analytic Cubism inspired Delaunay's fragmentation of form, oval format, and 
organization of the picture's space as a grid supporting intersecting planes. However, 
unlike the monochromatic, tactile planes of Cubism, those of Delaunay are not defined 
by line and modeling, but by the application of diaphanous, prismatic color. Delaunay 
wrote in 191 3: "Line is limitation. Color gives depth — not perspectival, not successive, 
but simultaneous depth — as well as form and movement." 1 As in visual perception of 
the real world, perception of Delaunay's painting is initially fragmentary, the eye 
continually moving from one form to others related by hue, value, tone, shape, or 
direction. As focus shifts, expands, jumps, and contracts in unending rhythms, one 
senses the fixed borders of the canvas and the tight interlocking of its contents. Because 
identification of representational forms is not necessary while the eye moves restlessly, 
judgments about the relative importance of parts are not made and all elements can be 
perceived as equally significant. The harmony of the pictorial reality provides an 
analogy to the concealed harmony of the world. At the left of the canvas Delaunay 
suggests glass, which, like his chromatic planes, is at once transparent, reflective, 
insubstantial, and solid. Glass may allude as well to the metaphor of art as a window 
on reality. (L. F.)

Ca. 1910-11 

Pastel on paper, 46.8 x 48.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 13 



Two of Frantisek Kupka's earliest purely abstract compositions are Amorpha, Warm 
Chromatic of 1911-12 (Private Collection) and Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors of 
1911-12 (Collection Narodni Galerie, Prague). The present pastel study reveals an 
early stage in the formal evolution of both of these paintings (Rudenstine, p. 436). In 
191 1 Kupka strove to eliminate objective subject matter from his paintings. His 
development toward abstraction is evident in his work of 1909 to 191 1 in his 
interpretations of motion and of the light and color of Gothic stained-glass windows. 
The Peggy Guggenheim pastel relates to a series of studies that followed a naturalistic 
painting of 1908-09 of his stepdaughter Andree playing naked with a red and blue ball 
in the garden of their home (Collection Musee National d'Art Moderne, Centre 
Georges Pompidou, Paris; see Rudenstine, p. 436). More than fifty studies led Kupka 
from conventional representation of this subject to the abstract formulations of the 
paintings of 19 12. In a note on one of the pencil drawings of Little Girl with Ball 
(Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York), Kupka details his frustrations: 
"Here I am only dissecting surfaces. The atmospheric copenetration is yet to be found. 
As long as there is a distinction in color between ground and flesh, I will fall back into 
the postcard photograph" (repr. and trans. Rudenstine, p. 436, fig. b). 

In the Peggy Guggenheim study, Kupka articulated the girl's motion by depicting the 
continuous penetration of the atmosphere by the ball. A curving brown body shape 
guides the ball through the blue path of its trajectory. This action occurs on a light 
green background plane, which suggests the three-dimensional space of the garden. 
Such residue of naturalistic color is abandoned in culminating versions of the study, 
such as Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors, which are conceived in blue, red, black, and 
white. Kupka discerned a musical parallel to these abstract forms in the rhythmic 
patterns of the fugue, "where the sounds evolve like veritable physical entities, 
intertwine, come and go."' Kupka's paintings of this period are not simple or formulaic 
abstractions from ultimate "sources" in nature, but are rather pictorial syntheses of the 
artist's formal ideas. (E. C. C.)

CONSTANTIN BRANCUS 



Maiastra 

I9I2(?) 

Polished brass, 73.1 cm high, including base 
76.2553 pg 50 



According to Constantin Brancusi's own testimony, his preoccupation with the image of 
the bird as a plastic form began as early as 19 10. With the theme of the Maiastra in the 
early teens he initiated a series of about thirty sculptures of birds. 

The word maiastra means "master" or "chief" in Brancusi's native Romanian, but 
the title refers specifically to a magically beneficent, dazzlingly plumed bird in 
Romanian folklore. Brancusi's mystical inclinations and his deeply rooted interest in 
peasant superstition make the motif an apt one. The golden plumage of the Maiastra is 
expressed in the reflective surface of the bronze; the bird's restorative song seems to 
issue from within the monumental puffed chest, through the arched neck, out of the 
open beak. The heraldic, geometric aspect of the figure contrasts with details such as 
the inconsistent size of the eyes, the distortion of the beak aperture, and the cocking of 
the head slightly to one side. The elevation of the bird on a saw-tooth base lends it the 
illusion of perching. The subtle tapering of form, the relationship of curved to hard- 
edge surfaces, and the changes of axis tune the sculpture so finely that the slightest 
alteration from version to version reflects a crucial decision in Brancusi's development 
of the theme. 

Seven other versions of Maiastra have been identified and located: three are marble 
and four bronze. The Peggy Guggenheim example apparently was cast from a reworked 
plaster (now lost but visible in a 1955 photograph of Brancusi's studio). 1 This was 
probably also the source for the almost identical cast in the collection of the Des Moines 
Art Center. (L. F.)

I932-4O 

Polished brass, 15 1.7 cm high, including base 
76.2553 pg 51 



The development of the bird theme in Constantin Brancusi's oeuvre can be traced from 
its appearance in the Maiastra sculptures (see plate 22), through the Golden Bird 
group, and, finally, to the Bird in Space series. Sixteen examples of the Bird in Space 
sequence, dating from 1923 to 1940, have been identified. The streamlined form of the 
present Bird in Space, stripped of individualizing features, communicates the notion 
of flight itself rather than describing the appearance of a particular bird. A vestige of 
the open beak of the Maiastra is retained in the beveled top of the tapering form, a 
slanted edge accelerating the upward movement of the whole. 

This sculpture, closely related to a marble version completed in 193 1 (Collection 
Kunsthaus Zurich), could have been cast as early as 1932 and finished in 1940 
(see Rudenstine, pp. 124-25). Though the shaft of the first Bird in Space (Private 
Collection, New York) was mounted on a discrete conical support, the support of the 
present example is incorporated as an organically irregular stem, providing an 
earthbound anchor for the sleek, soaring form. 

As was customary in Brancusi's work, the brass is smoothed and polished to the 
point where the materiality of the sculpture is dissolved in its reflective luminosity. 
Brancusi's spiritual aspirations, his longing for transcendence of the material world and 
its constraints, are verbalized in his description of Bird in Space as a "project before 
being enlarged to fill the vault of the sky.'" (L. F.)

VASILY KANDINSKY 



Landscape with Red Spots, No. 2 

(LANDSCHAFT MIT ROTEN FLECKEN, Nr. 2 

1913 

Oil on canvas, 117.5 x 140 cm 
76.2553 pg 33 



From 1908 Vasily Kandinsky often stayed in the town of Murnau in upper Bavaria, 
where his companion Gabriele Miinter bought a house in 1909. The landscapes 
inspired by these Alpine surroundings developed from the flattened, densely colored 
views of 1908 to the luminous, antimaterial dream visions of 1913, such as this canvas 
and the closely related Landscape with Red Spots, No. 1 (Collection Museum 
Folkwang, Essen). 

The motif of the church in a landscape recurs often in Kandinsky's paintings of 
1908-13. In examples of 1908-09 the particular design of the Murnau church makes 
identification possible, though the local topography may not be accurately reflected. By 
191 1 there is little specifying detail and the tower, which serves to divide the 
composition, has taken on a generalized, columnar appearance. In Landscape with Red 
Spots, No. 2 the tower is replaced by a mysterious elongated vertical form that seems to 
continue beyond the canvas edge into another realm. Like the nineteenth-century 
German Romantic painters, Kandinsky presents the landscape as an exalted, 
spiritualized vision. He achieves the sublimity of the image by freeing color from its 
descriptive function to reveal its latent expressive content. The chromatic emphasis is 
on the primary colors, applied thinly over a white ground. The focal point, the red spot 
that inspires the picture's title, bears out Kandinsky's appraisal of red as an expanding 
color that pulses forward toward the viewer, in contrast to cooler colors, particularly 
blue, that recede. Kandinsky indicates the naturalistic content of subject matter with 
abbreviated signs, emphasizing the purely pictorial aspects of color and form, and thus 
is able to dematerialize the objective world. (L. F.)

VASILY KANDINSKY 



White Cross 

(Weisses Kreuz) 

January-June 1922 

Oil on canvas, 100.5 x no.6 cm 

76.2553 PG34 



Vasily Kandinsky referred to the early 1920s as his "cool period." From this time 
geometric shapes became increasingly prevalent in his work, often floating in front of 
or within a broad plane, as in White Cross. Here straight lines and circles offset looser, 
organic forms and irregularly geometric shapes. A corresponding variation of 
brushstroke produces highly active passages contrasting with less inflected areas. Some 
shapes may have their distant origins in a naturalistic vocabulary of forms. Thus, the 
fishlike crescent and the lancing black diagonal that crosses it, which appear also in the 
related Red Oval of 1920 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), 
may recall the boat with oars in earlier works. However, the motifs are stripped of their 
representational meaning and do not contribute to an interpretation of the whole in 
terms of realistic content. 

The title isolates a detail of the composition, the white cross at upper right, a formal 
consequence of the checkerboard pattern (a recurrent motif in works of this period). In 
this instance negative space is treated as positive form. Once the cross of the title is 
seen, one begins to perceive throughout the work a proliferation of others, varying in 
degrees of explicitness. Though Kandinsky, like Kazimir Malevich, uses it as an abstract 
element, the cross is an evocative, symbolic form. 

The viewer's compulsion to read imagery literally is used to unexpected ends by 
Kandinsky, who includes two signs resembling the numeral 3 upended and affixed to 
directional arrows. The variations in direction of the resulting forms suggest the 
rotation of the entire canvas. The antigravitational feeling of floating forms and the 
placement of elements on a planar support against an indefinite background in White 
Cross reveal affinities with Malevich's Suprematist works (see plate 27). (L. F.)

Upward 

(Empor) 

October 1929 

Oil on cardboard, 70 x 49 cm 

76.2553 PG35 



Geometric shapes and sections of circles combine in Upward in a structure suspended in a 
field of rich turquoise and green. A partial circle rests delicately on a pointed base. 
Another fragment of a circle glides along its vertical diameter, reaching beyond the 
circumference of the first form to penetrate the space above it. Vasily Kandinsky achieves 
an effect of energy rising upward, while anchoring the forms together by balancing them 
on either side of a continuous vertical line. In a closely related work of the same period, 
Depressed (Collection Galleria Marescalchi, Bologna), Kandinsky distributes motifs of 
partial circles horizontally. Here he represses the sense of energy found in Upward both 
through his composition and a subdued palette. 

A linear design in the upper right corner of the present canvas echoes the vertical thrust 
of the central motif. This configuration resembles the letter E, as does the black cutout 
shape at the base of the central motif. Another E shape is legible in the upper right corner 
of a related drawing (Collection Musee National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges 
Pompidou, Paris; repr. Rudenstine, p. 421). These forms may at once be independent 
designs and playful references to the first letter of Empor, the German title of the painting. 

The related drawing reveals that the small black circle and the horizontal bars of the 
central motif, which have the physiognomic character of eye and mouth, were not part of 
Kandinsky's original design concept and evolved as he worked on the painting. As he 
wrote in 1929, the year he painted Upward, "I do not choose form consciously; it chooses 
itself within me." 1 The physiognomic character of Upward indicates Kandinsky's 
association at the Dessau Bauhaus with fellow Blaue Vier artists Paul Klee and Alexej 
Jawlensky. Jawlensky showed sixteen abstract heads, a motif that appeared in his work as 
early as 19 18, in an exhibition of the Blaue Vier at the Galerie Ferdinand Moller in Berlin 
in October 1929. Shown during the month when Upward was completed, these paintings 
offered Kandinsky the model of large, abstract faces composed of geometric planes of 
non-naturalistic color and accented by bar-shaped features. However, Kandinsky's 
working method more closely resembled that of Klee, who began with intuitively chosen 
forms that gradually suggested counterparts in the natural world, than that of Jawlensky, 
who began with the model and moved toward abstraction. In particular, the whimsy of 
the hovering black eye in Upward and the incorporation of a letter as a pictogram with a 
possible reference to the title of the painting suggest the reverberations of Klee's art. (E. C. C.)

KAZIMIR MALEVICH 



Untitled

Oil on canvas, 53 x 53 cm 

76.2553 PG42 



Kazimir Malevich proposed the reductive, abstract style of Suprematism as an 
alternative to earlier art forms, which he considered inappropriate to his own time. He 
observed that the proportions of forms in art of the past corresponded with those of 
objects in nature, which are determined by their function. In opposition to this he 
proposed a self-referential art in which proportion, scale, color, and disposition obey 
intrinsic, nonutilitarian laws. Malevich considered his non-objective forms to be 
reproductions of purely affective sensations that bore no relation to external 
phenomena. He rejected conventions of gravity, clear orientation, horizon line, and 
perspective systems. 

Malevich's units are developed from the straight line and its two-dimensional 
extension, the plane, and are constituted of contrasting areas of unmodeled color, 
distinguished by various textural effects. The diagonal orientation of geometric forms 
creates rhythms on the surface of the canvas. The overlapping of elements 
and their varying scale relationships within a white ground provide a sense of 
indefinitely extensive space. Though the organization of the pictorial forms does not 
correspond with that of traditional subjects, there are various internal regulatory 
principles. In the present work a magnetic attraction and repulsion seem to dictate the 
slow rotational movement of parts. (L. F.)

Untitled

Oil on canvas, 79.6 x 49.6 cm 

76.2553 PG43 



This painting reveals the principles of Suprematism that El Lissitzky absorbed under the 
influence of Kazimir Malevich in 1919-20. Trained as an engineer and possessing a 
more pragmatic temperament than that of his mentor, Lissitzky soon became one of the 
leading exponents of Constructivism. In the 1920s, while living in Germany, he became 
an important influence on both the Dutch De Stijl group and the artists of the German 
Bauhaus. 

Like Malevich, Lissitzky believed in a new art that rejected traditional pictorial 
structure, centralized compositional organization, mimesis, and perspectival 
consistency. In this work the ladder of vividly colored forms seems to be floating 
through indeterminate space. Spatial relationships are complicated by the veil of white 
color that divides these forms from the major gray diagonal. The linkage of elements 
is not attributable to a mysterious magnetic pull, as in Malevich's untitled painting 
(plate 27), but is indicated in a literal way by the device of a connecting threadlike line. 
The winding line changes color as it passes through the various rectangles that may 
serve as metaphors for different cosmic planes. (L. F.)

In 1920 Antoine Pevsner signed the Realistic Manifesto drafted by his brother Naum 
Gabo, proclaiming the intention of Constructivism as they conceived it. They sought to 
translate their apprehension of an absolute and essential reality as "the realization of 
our perceptions of the world in the forms of space and time." 1 They believed that space 
was given form through implications of depth rather than volume and they rejected 
mass as the basic sculptural element. Line, rendered dynamic through directionality, 
established kinetic rhythms. The Constructivists advocated the use of contemporary 
industrial materials; they did not carve or model these materials according to sculptural 
conventions, but constructed them according to principles of modern technology. In 
their words, "The plumb-line in our hand, eyes as precise as a ruler, in a spirit as taut as 
a compass ... we construct our work as the universe constructs its own, as the engineer 
constructs his bridges, as the mathematician his formula of the orbits." 2 

In this work Pevsner complicates the delineation of space by using a transparent sub- 
stance in conjunction with opaque materials. The glass panes echo both the rounded 
excised outlines of the construction and its angular metal surfaces. The metal ribs 
anchor the panes of glass and hinge all planes, real and imagined, resulting in a complex 
structuring of space. Furthermore, they function visually as an Orthodox cross. The 
icons of Pevsner's native Russia, which had played a crucial role in the development of 
his notions of perspective, may have suggested the form. (L. F.)

The Sea 

1914 

Charcoal and gouache on paper, mounted on panel; 

paper 87.6 x 120.3 cm ; panel 90.2 x 123 x 1.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 38 

Piet Mondrian first treated the theme of the sea in naturalistic works of 1 909-1 1, 
during lengthy sojourns in the village of Domburg on the coast of Dutch Zeeland. He 
assimilated and adapted the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris soon 
after his arrival there in the winter of 1911-12. He returned to the Netherlands in the 
summer of 19 14 and probably in the following war years worked on the studies of the 
sea that culminated in the Pier and Ocean paintings of 1917. 1 

The oval format and grid structure used in these works are devices derived from 
Cubism. They serve respectively to resolve the problem of the compositional 
interference of the corners and to organize and unify the picture's elements. For 
Mondrian the horizontal-vertical arrangement did not have an exclusively pictorial 
function, as it did for the Cubists, but carried mystical implications. He viewed the 
horizontal and vertical as basic oppositional principles that could interact to produce a 
union symbolizing a state of universal harmony. 

Although Mondrian's source exists in the natural world, in the motion of waves and 
their contact with breakwaters, the signs for this source have been reduced to their 
most essential pictorial form. The strokes are determined by their structural function 
rather than their descriptive potential, and there is no sense of perspectival recession 
despite the atmospheric texture of the gouache highlighting. This highlighting evokes 
the reflection of light on water and also defines planar surfaces. As Mondrian 
developed the theories of Neo-Plasticism, these suggestions of natural phenomena 
disappeared. (L. F.)

76.2553 pg 39 



From 1938 to 1940 Piet Mondrian, who had fled wartime Paris, was established in 
London near his friends Naum Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, and Ben Nicholson. During 
this period he continued working in the highly reductivist Neo-Plastic mode he had 
developed in France, in which horizontal and vertical black lines intersect on the canvas 
in asymmetrically balanced relationships to yield flat white or colored quadrilaterals. 
The palette is generally restricted to black, white, and primary colors. The present work 
is among the more coloristically austere examples. 

By divorcing form completely from its referential meaning, Mondrian hoped to 
provide a visual equivalent for the truths that inhabit nature but are concealed in its 
random, flawed manifestations. He felt that if he could communicate these truths by 
means of a system of resolved oppositions, a "real equation of the universal and the 
individual,'" the spiritual effect on the viewer would be one of total repose and 
animistic harmony. In order to effect this transmission the artist must sublimate his 
personality so that it does not interfere with the viewer's perception of the rhythmic 
equilibrium of line, dimension, and color. These elements, however, are organized not 
according to the impersonal dictates of mathematics but rather to the intuition of the 
artist. Likewise, although the artist's gesture is minimized and the reference to personal 
experience erased, his presence can be detected in the stroke of the paintbrush and the 
unevenness of the edge of the transcendent line. The individual consciousness exists in a 
dialectical relationship with "the absolute," which is realized pictorially through, in 
Mondrian's words, the "mutual interaction of constructive elements and their inherent 
relations." 1 Just as the forms and space of the canvas are abstracted from life, so the 
spiritual plane is removed from, though related to, the work of art. Mondrian sought to 
unite art, matter, and spirit to discover in all aspects of experience the universal 
harmony posited in Neo-Plasticism. (L. F.)

76.2553 PG41 



About 1924 Theo van Doesburg rebelled against Piet Mondrian's programmatic 
insistence on the restriction of line to vertical and horizontal orientations, and produced 
his first Counter-Composition. The direction consequently taken by Neo-Plasticism 
was designated "Elementarism" by van Doesburg, who described its method of 
construction as "based on the neutralization of positive and negative directions by the 
diagonal and, as far as color is concerned, by the dissonant. Equilibrated relations are 
not an ultimate result." 1 Mondrian considered this redefinition of Neo-Plasticism 
heretical; he was soon to resign from the De Stijl group. 

This canvas upholds the Neo-Plastic dictum of "peripheric" composition. The focus 
is decentralized and there are no empty, inactive areas. The geometric planes are 
emphasized equally, related by contrasts of color, scale, and direction. One's eyes follow 
the trajectories of isosceles triangles and stray beyond the canvas to complete mentally 
the larger triangles sliced off by its edges. The placement of the vertical axis to the left 
of center and the barely off-square proportions of the support create a sense of shifting 
balance. (L.F.)

76.2553 pg 59 

Georges Vantongerloo, who accepted the De Stijl restriction of line to horizontal and 
vertical in 19 19, based his sculpture on the volumetric translation of this principle. The 
variation of volume and proportion in his work was determined geometrically, often 
according to mathematical formulae. Mathematics was for Vantongerloo a convention 
that established order in the world, a rationalization of nature that could be combined 
successfully with an aesthetic intention to result in the production of a work of art. In 
this approach he felt closest to the medieval artist who composed within the constraints 
of geometric convention, and to the ancient Egyptians, whose solution to the 
"problem" of the pyramid of Cheops consisted in "the inscribed and circumscribed 
squares of a circle."' 

In one of his books Vantongerloo juxtaposed a diagram for the present work with an 
analytic sketch of the rose window at the cathedral of Amiens. 1 The asymmetry of the 
De Stijl image distinguishes it from the medieval subject. As the diagram shows and the 
title indicates, the extensions of the sculpture are determined by the lines of the 
inscribed and circumscribed squares of a circle. The relationships of its volumes result 
as much from the creative selectivity of the artist as from mathematical regulation. The 
effects of changing light produce subtle coloristic modulation and a relationship with 
the environment approaching that of architecture. (L. F.)

76.2553 PG 24 



Two other versions of this work exist. One of these, Still Life, is in the collection of the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the whereabouts of the other is 
presently unknown. The composition is informed by the Purist aesthetic as developed 
by Amedee Ozenfant and Le Corbusier in 19 18. Drawing on pre-1914 Cubism, 
particularly the coolly rational interpretation of Juan Gris, they dismissed its 
subsequent evolution as too decorative and unordered. They felt that the chaos of the 
natural world should be dispelled by the organizing mechanisms of the human mind. 
This conviction became a moral imperative that Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted 
to uphold in their work. 

Ozenfant used the following metaphor to describe the function of rational thought: 
"A lens concentrates the diffuse rays of the sun and creates fire by converging those rays. 
To converge is to refine something in nature, so as to render it more concentrated, 
compact, penetrative, intense: it helps to facilitate the manifestations of that 
phenomenon and to render it effective and useful for humanity." 1 Ozenfant's application 
of this principle to paintings such as Guitar and Bottles resulted in compositions that 
are lucid and geometric but somewhat dry. (L. F.)

JEAN HELION 



Equilibrium 

(Equilibre) 

1933-34 

Oil on canvas, 97.4 x 13 1.2 cm 

76.2553 pg 44 



Between 1932 and 1935 Jean Helion created a series of paintings exploring states of 
visual equilibrium. Among the earliest of these is Equilibrium (Collection Mr. and Mrs. 
Roy Friedman, Chicago), a simple composition of 1932 in which two curved rectangular 
shapes are held in balance by two slightly curved lines. In his working journal Helion 
recorded the following observations about this work: "In searching for the effect of space 
and movement on the elements, that is to say in constructing a work in movement, rather 
in creating equilibrium out of movement, my images have become more pliant. ... To 
establish relations between surfaces as complex as those which are defined by curves, it is 
necessary to arrange nuances." (Quoted in Rudenstine, p. 404, author's translation.) 

Following this initial experimentation, Helion composed several variations on the 
theme of equilibrium. Generally he worked with drawings and oil studies before 
reaching the formal solutions of his large canvases. His concern in the present work is 
to establish a balance between the blocky, simple, essentially rectangular mass on the 
right with the more complex, more colorful, and varied forms on the left. The 
construction on the left, which is composed of overlapping and interpenetrating curves, 
bars, and lines, is not continuous. Careful inspection reveals that the unit of four 
elements in the upper left corner (the red, gray, and black bars and the green shape) 
does not touch the forms immediately below it. A similarly strategic use of 
discontinuous forms occurs in other works in the Equilibrium series. In the present 
painting the subtly disconnected arrangement contributes to the sense of movement and 
dispersion of the left side of the composition. The multiple hues used at the left also 
generate visual complexity. The horizontal curves on the left all point to the central 
white void which is embraced by the more rigidly horizontal dark blue and light green 
arms of the stable construction on the right. Vibrant red and orange bars unite the 
edges of the composition with central forms and bind together right and left halves. A 
state of visual balance is thus achieved without resorting to the purely rectilinear, often 
programmatic formulations of the De Stijl artists who had influenced Helion. The 
Equilibrium series, embodying ideas of suspension and tension of two-dimensional 
forms, inspired Alexander Calder, who was contemporaneously developing his wind- 
driven mobiles (see plate 68).' (E. C. C.)

The Red Tower 

(La Tour rouge) 

1913 

Oil on canvas, 73.5 x 100.5 cm 
76.2553 pg 64 



Giorgio de Chirico's enigmatic works of 1911 to 1917 provided a crucial inspiration 
for the Surrealist painters. The dreamlike atmosphere of his compositions results from 
irrational perspective, the lack of a unified light source, the elongation of shadows, and 
a hallucinatory focus on objects. Italian piazzas bounded by arcades or classical facades 
are transformed into ominously silent and vacant settings for invisible dramas. The 
absence of event provokes a nostalgic or melancholy mood if one senses the wake of a 
momentous incident; if one feels the imminence of an act, a feeling of anxiety ensues. 
De Chirico remarked that "every object has two appearances: one, the current one, 
which we nearly always see and which is seen by people in general; the other, a spectral 
or metaphysical appearance beheld only by some individuals in moments of 
clairvoyance and metaphysical abstraction, as in the case of certain bodies concealed by 
substances impenetrable by sunlight yet discernible, for instance, by x-ray or other 
powerful artificial means.'" Traces of concealed human presences appear in the fraught 
expanse of this work. One is the partly concealed equestrian monument often identified 
as Carlo Marochetti's 1861 statue of King Carlo Alberto in Turin, 2 which also appears 
in the background of de Chirico's The Departure of the Poet of 1914 (Private Collection). 
In addition, in the left foreground, overpainting barely conceals two figures (or statues), 
one of which resembles a shrouded mythological hero by the nineteenth-century 
Swiss painter Arnold Bocklin. The true protagonist, however, is the crenellated tower; in 
its imposing centrality and rotundity it conveys a virile energy that fills the pictorial 
space. (L.F.)

The Nostalgia of the Poet 

(La Nostalgie du poete) 

1914 

Oil and charcoal on canvas, 89.7 x 40.7 cm 

76.2553 pg 65 



This work belongs to a series of paintings of 19 14 on the subject of the poet, the best 
known of which is the Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire (Collection Musee National 
d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; repr. Rudenstine, p. 162). Recurrent 
motifs in the sequence are the plaster bust with dark glasses, the mannequin, and the 
fish mold on an obelisk. These objects, bearing no evident relationships to one another, 
are compressed here into a narrow vertical format that creates a claustrophobic and 
enigmatic space. 

As in The Red Tower (plate 36), the use of inanimate forms imitating or alluding to 
human beings has complex ramifications. The sculpture at the lower left is a painted 
representation of a plaster cast from a stone, marble, or metal bust by an imaginary, or 
at present unidentified, sculptor. The character portrayed could be mythological, 
historical, symbolical, or fictional. The fish is a charcoal drawing of a metal mold that 
could produce a baked "cast" of a fish made with an actual fish. The fish has additional 
connotations as a religious symbol, and the hooklike graphic sign toward which its 
gaping mouth is directed has its own cryptic allusiveness. The mannequin is a simplified 
cloth cast of a human figure — a mold on which clothing is shaped to conform to the 
contours of a person. Each object, though treated as solid and static, dissolves in 
multiple significations and paradoxes. Such amalgams of elusive meaning in Giorgio de 
Chirico's strangely intense objects compelled the attention of the Surrealists. (L. F.)

MARC CHAGALL 



Rain 

(La Pluie) 

1911 

Oil (and charcoal?) on canvas, 86.7 x 108 cm 

76.2553 PG63 



Marc Chagall's early work is characterized by a neo-primitive style derived primarily 
from Russian icons and folk art. When he moved from Russia to Paris in the summer 
of 19 10, the artist took with him several of these paintings depicting the life and 
customs of his native Vitebsk. During the next year he reworked them and also painted 
new compositions with similar motifs, infused with nostalgia for his homeland, but 
now adapted according to techniques and concepts he acquired from exposure to 
current French art. 

Nondescriptive, saturated color is used in Rain in combination with assertive areas of 
white and black to produce a highly ornamental and vivid surface. Chagall's use of 
color was influenced by that of Henri Matisse and Robert Delaunay, whose work he saw 
almost immediately upon his arrival in Paris. The breaking up of some areas of the 
composition into shaded planes, for example the roof of the house and the left foreground, 
has its source in Cubism, though this device is handled somewhat randomly. ( L. F. )

Watercolor and oil transfer drawing on paper, mounted on gouache-painted board, 

42.5 x 31 cm, including mount 

76.2553 pg 89 

Paul Klee's vacation in Sicily during the summer of 1924 provided him with the 
subjects for several watercolors that capture the color, light, and mood of a specific 
geographical location and cast of characters. This portrait and that of Frau R. on a 
Journey to the South, also of 1924 (present whereabouts unknown), are good-natured 
caricatures of what might be two prim northern ladies whose absurd hats insufficiently 
shield them from the intensity of the Mediterranean sun. 

The registers that break Frau R. into horizontal sections do not so rigidly stratify 
Frau P.; her hat dips at a jaunty angle. The vivid, warm color that thickens and thins 
atmospherically over the surface of the page is incised with simplified graphic contours. 
The black smudges on the surface result from the use of a transfer technique often 
employed by Klee in this period. In this technique, one side of a sheet of paper was 
coated with black oil and laid against a blank support. Then a drawing was placed on 
top of these two layers and its lines traced with a stylus, transferring the outline to the 
lower sheet.' Finally, watercolor was added. 

The heart shape on Frau P.'s chest appears frequently in Klee's work, sometimes as a 
mouth, nose, or torso. The motif bridged the organic and inorganic worlds for the 
artist by symbolizing life forces while serving as a "mediating form between circle and 
rectangle." 1 (L.F.)

(Zaubergarten) 

March 1926 

Oil on plaster-filled wire mesh, 52.9 x 44.9 cm, including artist's frame 

76.2553 pg 90 



Magic Garden was executed in 1926, the year Paul Klee resumed teaching at the 
Bauhaus at its new location in Dessau. During his Bauhaus period he articulated and 
taught a complex theoretical program that was supported and clarified by his painting 
and drawing. Theory, in turn, served to elucidate his art. Based on probing 
investigation and carefully recorded observation, his work in both areas reveals 
analogies among the properties of natural, of man-made, and of geometric forms. 

Studies of plants illustrating growth processes appear often in Klee's notebooks as 
well as in his paintings and drawings. He was also interested in architecture and 
combined images of buildings with vegetal forms in Magic Garden and several other 
works of 1926. Pictorial motifs often arise from geometric exercises: the goblet shape 
that dominates the lower center of this composition appeared also in a 
nonrepresentational drawing exploring the development from point to line to surface to 
volume. 

The surface Klee creates with the medium of Magic Garden resembles that of a 
primordial substance worn and textured by its own history. A cosmic eruption seems to 
have spewed forth forms that are morphologically related but differentiated into various 
genera. Although excused from the laws of gravity, each of these forms occupies a 
designated place in a new universe, simultaneously as fixed and mobile as the orbits of 
planets or the nuclei of organic cells. Klee's cosmic statements are gleefully irreverent; he 
writes of his work: "Ethical gravity rules, along with hobgoblin laughter at the learned 
ones." 1 (L.F.)

125.7 x 97.8 cm, including artist's painted frame 

76.2553 pg 67 

In 191 5 Francis Picabia abandoned his exploration of abstract form and color to adopt 
a new machinist idiom that he used until about 1923. Unlike Robert Delaunay or 
Fernand Leger, who saw the machine as an emblem of a new age, he was attracted to 
machine shapes for their intrinsic visual and functional qualities. He often used 
mecanomorphic images humorously as substitutes for human beings; for example, in 
Here, This is Stieglitz, 191 5 (Collection The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), 
the photographer Alfred Stieglitz is portrayed as a camera. In Very Rare Picture on the 
Earth a self-generating, almost symmetrical machine is presented frontally, clearly 
silhouetted against a flat, impassive background. Like Picabia's own Amorous Parade of 
1917 (Collection Mr. and Mrs. Morton G. Neumann, Chicago) or Marcel Duchamp's 
The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even of 1915-23 (Collection Philadelphia 
Museum of Art), the present work might be read as the evocation of a sexual event in 
mechanical terms. This dispassionate view of sex is consonant with the antisentimental 
attitudes that were to characterize Dada. The work has also been interpreted as 
representing an alchemical processor, in part because of the coating of the two upper 
cylinders with gold and silver leaf respectively.' 

Not only is Very Rare Picture on the Earth one of Picabia's earliest mecanomorphic 
works, but it has been identified as his first collage. 2 Its mounted wooden forms and 
integral frame draw attention to the work as object — the picture is not really a picture, 
making it "very rare" indeed. Thus, an ironic note is added to the humorous pomposity 
of the inscription at upper left. (L. F.)

In 191 5 Man Ray abandoned what he called his "Romantic-Expressionist-Cubist" style 
and adopted a mechanistic, graphic, flattened idiom like that developed by Francis 
Picabia and Marcel Duchamp during the same period. This drawing is preparatory to 
his most successful painting in this style, The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with 
Her Shadows of 191 6 (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York; repr. 
Rudenstine, p. 483), the subject of which was inspired by a vaudeville dancer whose 
movement he wished to suggest in a series of varying poses. 1 Man Ray's interest in 
frozen sequential movement may derive from the experiments in photography he 
initiated about this time. 

The particularized features of the figures in this drawing are eliminated to produce 
two-dimensional patterned forms that are silhouetted against black oval shadows. The 
dancer is accompanied not only by her shadow but also by music, concisely indicated 
by the voluted head of an instrument at the lower right of the support, the strings 
across the bottom, and the music stand at left. The position of her feet on the strings, 
which may double as a stave, may be meant to convey a specific sequence of notes, as if 
the dancer were indeed accompanying herself musically. It seems likely that this 
drawing represents the first stage in the conception of the painting. In the canvas the 
three positions of the dancer are superimposed and appear at the top of the 
composition, with the greater part of the field occupied by her distorted, enlarged, and 
vividly colored cutout shadows. (L. F.)

Little Machine . . . was executed in Cologne the year Dada was established there. It 
belongs to a series of about fifty works dating from 1919-20, based on diagrams of 
scientific instruments, in which Max Ernst used printer's plates to reproduce preexisting 
images. The impressions, once altered by traditional coloristic and modeling effects, 
occupy a position between found object and artistic product, like his collages. 

In both subject and style the series can be compared with Francis Picabia's 
mecanomorphic drawings and paintings. Ernst shared with Picabia an interest in 
typography, printed images, and language; many of the forms in the present work can 
be read as letters. They function as well to describe a mechanical structure that can be 
seen as a symbol of sexual activity, like Picabia's Very Rare Picture on the Earth (plate 
41) and his The Child Carburetor, 19 19 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 
New York), or Marcel Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, 
1915-23 (Collection Philadelphia Museum of Art). Ernst's machine is a fantasized 
solution to the psychological pressures of sexual performance, as announced in the 
humorously heroic inscription at the bottom of the sheet: Little machine constructed 
by minimax dadamax in person for fearless pollination of female suckers at the 
beginning of the change of life and for other such fearless functions. The right side of the 
machine seems to comprise a miniature laboratory for the production of semen, which 
is indicated as a red drop that courses through passageways to the left side of the 
apparatus. The drop finally issues from the yellow faucet, accompanied by a whimsically 
self-assured and cheerful "Bonjour." Alternatively, the machine can be seen as a 
combination of male and female halves. The female (at the right) is dowdy and angular; 
the more brilliantly colored male (at the left) "fearlessly" points away from her. (L. F.)

The Kiss 

(Le Baiser) 

1927 

Oil on canvas, 129 x 16 1.2 cm 

76.2553 pg 71 



From humorously clinical depictions of erotic events in the Dada period, such as Little 
Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (plate 43), Max Ernst moved on 
to celebrations of uninhibited sexuality in his Surrealist works. His liaison and 
marriage with the young Marie-Berthe Aurenche in 1927 may have inspired the erotic 
subject matter of this painting and others of this year. The major compositional lines of 
this work may have been determined by the configurations of string that Ernst dropped 
on a preparatory surface, a procedure according with Surrealist notions of the 
importance of chance effects. However, Ernst used a coordinate grid system to transfer 
his string configurations to canvas, thus subjecting these chance effects to conscious 
manipulation. Visually, the technique produces undulating calligraphic rhythms, like 
those traced here against the glowing earth and sky colors. 

The centralized, pyramidal grouping and the embracing gesture of the upper figure in 
The Kiss have lent themselves to comparison with Renaissance compositions, specifically 
the Madonna and Saint Anne by Leonardo da Vinci (Collection Musee National du 
Louvre, Paris).' The Leonardo work was the subject of a psychosexual interpretation by 
Sigmund Freud, whose writings were important to Ernst and other Surrealists. The 
adaptation of a religious subject would add an edge of blasphemy to the exuberant 
lasciviousness of Ernst's picture. (L. F.)

The Forest 
(La Foret) 

1927-28 

Oil on canvas, 96.3 x 129.5 cm 

76.2553 PG72 



Andre Breton's Surrealist Manifesto of 1924 proclaimed "pure psychic automatism" as 
an artistic ideal, emphasizing inspiration derived from the chance juxtaposition of 
forms and the haphazard use of materials. Max Ernst came under the influence of 
Breton's ideas in 1924, and soon thereafter developed his frottage or rubbing 
technique. 1 In making his first frottages, he dropped pieces of paper at random on floor 
boards and rubbed them with pencil or chalk, thus transferring the design of the wood 
grain to the paper. He next adapted this technique to oil painting, scraping paint from 
prepared canvases laid over materials such as wire mesh, chair caning, leaves, buttons, 
or twine (see plate 46). His repertory of objects closely parallels that used by Man Ray 
in his experiments with Rayograms during the same period. Using his grattage 
(scraping) technique, Ernst covered his canvases completely with pattern and then 
interpreted the images that emerged, thus allowing texture to suggest composition in a 
spontaneous fashion. In The Forest the artist probably placed the canvas over a rough 
surface (perhaps wood), scraped oil paint over the canvas, and then rubbed, scraped, 
and overpainted the area of the trees (Rudenstine, pp. 287-89). 

The subject of a dense forest appears often in Ernst's work of the late twenties and 
early thirties. These canvases, of which The Quiet Forest, 1927 (Collection 
Kunstmuseum Basel), is another example, generally contain a wall of trees, a solar disk, 
and an apparition of a bird hovering amid the foliage. Ernst's attitude toward the forest 
as the sublime embodiment of both enchantment and terror can be traced to his 
experiences in the German forest as a child." His essay "Les Mysteres de la foret," 
published in Minotaur -e in 1934, vividly conveys his fascination with the various kinds 
of forests. The Peggy Guggenheim canvas resonates with those qualities he identified 
with the forests of Oceania: "They are, it seems, savage and impenetrable, black and 
russet, extravagant, secular, swarming, diametrical, negligent, ferocious, fervent, and 
likeable, without yesterday or tomorrow. . . . Naked, they dress only in their majesty 
and their mystery." (Author's translation.) (E. C. C.)

Zoomorphic Couple 

(Couple zoomorphe) 

1933 

Oil on canvas, 91.9 x 73.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 75 



By 1925 Max Ernst had developed his frottage (rubbing) technique, which he associated 
with a childhood memory of accidental forms materializing within the grooves 
of wooden floorboards. He also acknowledged the influence of his later discovery of 
Leonardo da Vinci's Treatise on Painting, in which artists are advised to gaze at the 
stains on walls until figures and scenes emerge. In the Hordes series of 1926-32 Ernst 
placed twine beneath his canvases and then rubbed pigment over their surfaces. The 
meanderings of the twine were thus revealed; these chance configurations were then 
manipulated to elicit imagery. In Zoomorphic Couple, the appearance of light, sinuous 
channels through dark painted areas produces a relieflike effect suggestive of frottage. 
However, the artist created the effect here by putting paint-laden string or rope on top of 
the canvas and spraying over it (Rudenstine, p. 299). The image of the bird, which 
recurs frequently in Ernst's work from 1925, had become an almost obsessive 
preoccupation by 1930. In the present painting one can discern a vaguely birdlike form 
and a caressing humanoid arising from the primordial material that gives them their 
substance. It has been suggested that the atavistic imagery in Ernst's work of this period 
alludes to the failure of European civilization in the face of the rising National Socialist 
threat in Germany. 1 (Ernst was blacklisted by the party in 1933 when Hitler became 
Chancellor of the Third Reich.) Though a sensitivity to the current political climate may 
be inferred, it is not confirmed by anecdotal detail. The forms have the effect of dream 
or poetic apparition. 

The sense of genesis and evolutionary stirrings in Zoomorphic Couple is 
complemented by the creative inventiveness of the artist, who combines layers of pastel 
color under spattered, blown, and dripped paint. (L. F.)

Attirement of the Bride 
(La Toilette de la mariee) 

1940 

Oil on canvas, 129.6 x 96.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 7 8 



Attirement of the Bride is an example of Max Ernst's veristic or illusionistic Surrealism, 
in which a traditional technique is applied to an incongruous or unsettling subject. The 
theatrical, evocative scene has roots in late nineteenth-century Symbolist painting, 
especially that of Gustave Moreau. It also echoes the settings and motifs of sixteenth- 
century German art. The willowy, swollen-bellied figure types recall those of Lucas 
Cranach the Elder in particular. The architectural backdrop with its strong contrast of 
light and shadow and its inconsistent perspective shows the additional influence of 
Giorgio de Chirico, whose work had overwhelmed Ernst when he first saw it in 19 19. 

The pageantry and elegance of the image are contrasted with its primitivizing 
aspects — the garish colors, the animal and monster forms — and the blunt phallic 
symbolism of the poised spearhead. The central scene is contrasted as well with its 
counterpart in the picture-within-a-picture at the upper left. In this detail the bride 
appears in the same pose, striding through a landscape of overgrown classical ruins. 
Here Ernst has used the technique of decalcomania invented in 1935 by Oscar 
Dominguez, in which diluted paint is pressed onto a surface with an object that 
distributes it unevenly, such as a pane of glass. A suggestive textured pattern results. 

The title of this work had occurred to Ernst at least as early as 1936, when he 
italicized it in a text in his book Beyond Painting. Ernst had long identified himself with 
the bird, and had invented an alter ego, Loplop, Superior of the Birds, in 1929. Thus 
one may perhaps interpret the bird-man at the left as a depiction of the artist; the bride 
may in some sense represent the young English Surrealist artist Leonora Carrington.

The Antipope 

December 1941-March 1942 

Oil on canvas, 160.8 x 127. 1 cm 

76.2553 pg 80 



Max Ernst settled in New York in 1941 after escaping from Europe with the help of 
Peggy Guggenheim. The same year he executed a small oil on cardboard (now in the 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection) that became the basis for the large-scale The Antipope. 
When Guggenheim saw the small version, she interpreted a dainty horse-human figure 
on the right as Ernst, who was being fondled by a woman she identified as herself. She 
wrote that Ernst conceded that a third figure, depicted in a three-quarter rear view, was 
her daughter Pegeen; she did not attempt to identify another horse-headed female to 
the left. 1 When Ernst undertook the large version from December to March he changed 
the body of the "Peggy" figure into a greenish column and transferred her amorous 
gesture to a new character, who wears a pink tunic and is depicted in a relatively 
naturalistic way. The "Pegeen" figure in the center appears to have two faces, one of a 
flayed horse that looks at the horse-woman at the left. The other, with only its cheek 
and jaw visible, gazes in the opposite direction, out over the grim lagoon, like a pensive 
subject conceived by Caspar David Friedrich. 

The great upheavals in Ernst's personal life during this period encourage such a 
biographical interpretation. Despite his marriage to Guggenheim, he was deeply 
involved with Leonora Carrington at this time, and spent hours riding horses with her. 
As birds were an obsession for Ernst, so horses were for Carrington. Her identification 
with them is suggested throughout her collection of stories La Dame ovale, published 
in 1939 with seven illustrations by Ernst, two of which include metamorphosed horse 
creatures. It seems plausible that the alienated horse-woman of The Antipope, who 
twists furtively to watch the other horse-figure, represents a vision of Guggenheim 
(Rudenstine, pp. 315-17). Like the triumphal bride in Attirement of the Bride (plate 47), 
she wears an owl headgear. Her irreconcilable separation from her companion is 
expressed graphically by the device of the diagonally positioned spear that bisects 
the canvas. The features of the green totemic figure resemble those of Carrington, whose 
relationship with Ernst was to end soon after the painting was completed, when she 
moved to Mexico with her husband. (L. F.)

In 191 5, shortly before he joined the Zurich Dada group, Jean Arp produced what he 
described as his "first 'essential' picture," the simplified geometric elements of which he 
associated with children's building blocks organized in a spirit of play. By 191 8 the 
artist, influenced by the rectilinear strictness of Sophie Taeuber's work, eliminated 
curves and diagonals from his collages (Rudenstine, pp. 62-64). As the upheaval and 
anxiety associated with World War I subsided, he concentrated on distilling a world of 
calm, simplicity, and order in his work. His collages literally emphasized the 
constructive activity of the artist in opposition to or in disregard of the explicitly 
destructive, iconoclastic attitudes promulgated by the Dadaists. 

Arp based the composition of the present collage on modular rectangles of two sizes 
distributed along a grid. The proportional ratio of each module is one to one and one- 
quarter. The only vertically aligned rectangle, at upper center, is inconsistently small 
and superimposed on another rectangle. The cream-colored areas serve as a ground in 
which either vertical or horizontal rectangles can be visualized, thereby introducing an 
element of uncertainty into a composition that at first appears clear and declarative. 
The way in which collaged elements are integrated with the support results in an 
ambiguous relationship between figure and ground. 

This work, damaged beyond repair, was reconstructed by the artist in 1955 
(Rudenstine, p. 60). (L.F.)

Jean Arp participated in Dada activities in Zurich in the teens; during the mid-twenties 
he allied himself to a certain extent with Surrealism, which had assimilated many of the 
tendencies of Dada. Although Arp resisted the program of the Surrealists, he shared 
their faith in unfettered creativity, their celebration of spontaneity, and their 
antirational stance. 

He executed his first monochrome wood reliefs in 19 14, adding the element of color 
two years later. Comprised of discrete wood forms mounted individually on wood 
supports, these reliefs are assembled like collages rather than carved. Arp continued to 
make reliefs throughout his life. By combining aspects of painting, collage, and 
sculpture, the reliefs of the teens and twenties served in some sense as a bridge to his 
sculpture in the round. Arp regarded his simplified forms as emblems of natural growth 
processes. As he wrote: "I looked for new constellations of form such as nature never 
stops producing. I tried to make forms grow. I put my trust in the example of seeds, 
stars, clouds, plants, animals, men, and finally in my innermost being." 1 According to 
Arp, his works carried their own momentum and arrived at organic solutions subject as 
much to the laws of chance as to his conscious manipulations. He commented on the 
"ridiculous" analogies of forms that resulted from this process; his descriptive titles, 
such as that of the present work or Shirt Front and Fork or Dress with Eye and Navel, 
were often correspondingly whimsical. (L. F.)

Kurt Schwitters, though closely identified with the iconoclastic Dada movement, was 
also committed to Modernist ideals of pure and self-sufficient art. With a connoisseur's 
discernment he redeemed objects from the detritus of daily life and incorporated them 
into his Merz works. Even the most raw or worn surfaces are endowed with a poetic 
grace. The designation Merz is derived from the truncation of the Kommerz, which 
appears in an early collage (present whereabouts unknown). Glued or nailed ticket 
stubs, cigarette wrappings, bits of fabric, wood, tin, and pottery interact in his Merz 
collages to produce compositions of compelling structural authority. These objects lose 
their conventional associations because of the change of context and the formal 
manipulations to which they are subjected. 

Visually these works are related in some respects to the collages of Pablo Picasso and 
Georges Braque, the paintings of Robert Delaunay, and the mixed-media sculptures of 
Umberto Boccioni. Like the Cubists, Schwitters often included printed words or letters, 
which appealed to him for their intrinsic formal qualities. Here he probably intended a 
wry comment on his work in the clearly legible words on the cigarette package at the 
lower right: made of . . . best old. Below, he added the inscription: Mz 75/K. 
Scb.io/Zeichnung blass. Mz stands for Merzzeichnung or Merz Drawings Zeichnung 
Mass means "pale drawing." Like his other humorously self-deprecating titles (Nothing 
At All or It's So Lovely) "pale drawing" seems to be conceived by Schwitters in an 
irreverent Dada mood. (L. F.)

Kurt Schwitters abandoned his Merz pictures to a large extent during the mid- to late 
1920s to concentrate on paintings, constructions, and reliefs in which the influence of 
Russian Constructivism and the work of his friend Theo van Doesburg is discernable. 
He eliminated found materials from these compositions and thereby reduced the Dada 
element of chance they contributed in order to achieve a less idiosyncratic and hence 
more universal form of expression. This development accorded with his belief in the 
ascendancy of formal values, which he felt should not be jeopardized by references to 
anything outside the work of art. 

When Schwitters returned to the Merz idiom in 1930, he placed more emphasis on 
the act of painting than he had in his early collages. Though the planes are shaped with 
the impersonality of geometric contour, they are animated by the variation of rhythmic 
brushstrokes and the addition of collaged forms. In the tradition of his Merz works of 
the classic period of 1919 to the mid-i92os, the objects he adopted were disposable 
articles — the top of a corroded tin can and a metal butterfly; the picture once included a 
broken piece of china to the right of the tin circle and two wooden balls below the 
butterfly. While the objects function as abstract elements within the flat confines of the 
support, their projection contradicts the two-dimensionality of the picture plane and 
implies an extension of the work of art into the observer's world. (L. F.)

Painting 
(Peinture) 

192.5 

Oil on canvas, 114. 5 x 145.7 cm 

76.2553 pg 91 



During the mid- to late 1920s Joan Miro developed a private system of imagery in 
which the motifs have symbolic meanings that vary according to their context. By 
studying the constellations of these motifs, one is encouraged to infer meanings 
appropriate to a particular painting. 

In Painting two "personages" (the designation Miro used for his abstract figures) 
and a flame have been identified. The personage on the right can perhaps be read as a 
female because of the curvaceous nature of the eight-shape, and by analogy with forms 
in other paintings that are specifically identified by the artist as women. The black dot 
with radiating lines can be interpreted as the figure's eye receiving rays of light, or as a 
bodily or verbal emission. The same motif appears in Personage, also of 1925, in the 
collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Moons, stars, suns, or 
planets float at the upper left of several canvases of the mid-i92os. In the present work 
the semicircular orange-red image not only carries a cosmic implication, but also 
possibly doubles as the head of the second personage, probably a male. This head is 
presented in a combined full-face and profile view, in the manner of Pablo Picasso's 
Cubist portraits. 

The flame, used repeatedly by Miro in this period, may signify sexual excitation in 
this context. The erotic content that prevails in much of his work in 1925 is 
particularly explicit in the Lovers series, in which two figures approach each other or 
are united in sexual embrace. The two figures in Painting are less clearly conjoined. The 
submersion of legible subject matter and the ambiguity of the painting's meaning 
transfer the emphasis to the purely abstract qualities of the work. Line and color 
articulate a language as complex and poetic as the hieroglyphic signs that constitute the 
imagery. The generalized ground, rich in texture from the uneven thinning of paint and 
the use of shadowy black, provides a warm and earthy support for the expressive black 
lines, the areas of red and yellow, and the staccato rhythm of dots. (L. F.)

Dutch Interior II 

(Interieur hollandais 

Summer 1928 

Oil on canvas, 92 x 73 cm 

76.2553 PG92 



In 1928 Joan Miro returned to Paris from a trip to the Netherlands with several 
postcard reproductions of works by seventeenth-century Dutch artists. At least two of 
these have been identified as sources for the Dutch Interior paintings in the Museum of 
Modern Art, New York (repr. Rudenstine, p. 544, fig. h) and the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection. 1 The Guggenheim work is a transformation of Jan Steen's The Dancing 
Lesson (Collection Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; repr. Rudenstine, p. 542, fig. a) and 
conveys the synthesis of carefully observed, precisely executed detail and imaginative 
generalization of form that proceeded from Miro's encounter with the Dutch Baroque. 
In this combination of objective minutiae and abstract vision, Dutch Interior II reverts 
conceptually to works of the early 1920s, such as The Tilled Field, 1923-24 (Collection 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York). 

The gradual translation of veristic detail into eccentric, evocative form can be 
followed through preliminary sketches of specific motifs to a meticulously complete 
preparatory drawing. A conspicuous modification of the Dutch original is Miro's 
enlargement of and focus on human and animal figures and his concomitant 
suppression or deemphasis of inanimate objects. Thus a window at the upper center of 
the Steen has been greatly reduced in size, as though it had been sent hurtling through a 
vast space. The real subject of the Steen is not the cat, but the sound, movement, and 
hilarity the dancing lesson provokes. Miro seizes on this anomaly in his version: 
although the cat serves as the hub of his centrifugal composition, he emphasizes the 
cacophony and animation of the lesson through the swirling motion of myriad details 
and the dancing rhythm of points and counterpoints. (L. F.)

Seated Woman II 

(Femme assise II) 

February 27, 1939 

Oil on canvas, 162 x 130 cm 

76.2553 PG93 



The expressionistic Seated Woman II can be seen as a final manifestation of Joan 
Miro's peintures sauvages, works characterized by violence of execution and imagery. 
It was painted at a time when Miro, like Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez (see 
plate 56), was responding acutely to the events of the Spanish Civil War. 

The human figure has been transmogrified here into a grotesque and bestial creature. 
However, the aggressiveness of imagery and formal elements coexists with fanciful 
details and cosmic implications. Though the open, saw-toothed mouth imparts a sense 
of the woman's voraciousness or anguish, her bottle-breast implies her generative force. 
Her expansive torso constitutes an impenetrable ground, its horizon line described by 
her squared shoulders, out of which grow the vegetative stems of arms and neck. The 
bird and fish forms floating through the atmosphere become insignias for air and water, 
while the moon, star, and planet emblems on the woman's collar broaden the 
associations to encompass the astral plane. The remaining abstract shapes seem to 
course slowly in mysterious orbits, passing through and beyond one another, changing 
color where they intersect. A cohesive universe is created despite the dichotomies of 
light and dark, nurture and destruction, life and nonexistence. Integration is provided 
by the repetition of shapes, such as the leaf and oval, which suggests analogies: the 
woman's pendant becomes a moon or vagina, her hair resembles lines of sight, like 
those of the fish, or rays of light, and her teeth are equated with the decorative motifs 
or mountains in the miniature landscape of her collar. 

This work postdates by about two months the more generalized Seated Woman I 
(Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York; repr. Rudenstine, p. 546,

76.2553 pg 136 



During the late 1930s Julio Gonzalez worked simultaneously in naturalistic and 
abstract idioms. His abstract mode constituted an important contribution to the 
development of avant-garde sculpture in both Europe and the United States. This mode 
is exemplified by "Monsieur" Cactus of 1939, in which he returns to the metamorphic 
theme of several earlier sculptures. As in works by other Spanish artists living abroad 
during the Civil War, the figure is anguished — see, for example, Joan Miro's Seated 
Woman II (plate 55) or Pablo Picasso's Guernica of 1937 (Collection Museo Nacional 
Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid). Indeed, several of the more literal preparatory 
drawings for the sculpture, dating from December of 1938, suggest that the figure is 
shrieking; the prickly nails intensify the aggressive effect of the work, recalling Picasso's 
use of nails in his Guitar of 1926 (Collection Musee Picasso, Paris). Though the 
distortion and dislocation of anatomical features make positive identification difficult, 
with the aid of the drawings one can read a raised arm joined to the hip, its five fingers 
spread like a cluster of cylindrical cactus stems. The analogous five-fingered block to 
the left of the torso seems to be lowered to a position just above an angular phallus. 
The companion to this sculpture, known as Cactus Man II or "Madame" Cactus, 
has been interpreted as the image of the Spanish peasant's defiance of Franco's fascist 
threat. 1 While the synthesis of human being and cactus may reflect the identification of 
the Spanish peasant with the land, the metamorphic figure may more generally 
personify the republican cause. At the end of 1938 Franco launched a major offensive 
against Catalonia, Gonzalez's native province, and was to take its capital, Barcelona, in 
January of 1939, signaling the end of republican hopes. By the time the drawings for 
the second cactus sculpture appeared in the summer of 1939, Madrid had fallen and 
Franco's Falange was in full power. (L. F.)

In a group of works made between 1930 and 1933, Alberto Giacometti used the

anatomical parts to express the fears and urges of the subconscious. The aggressiveness 
with which the human figure is treated in these fantasies of brutal erotic assault 
graphically conveys their content. The female, seen in horror and longing as both victim 
and victimizer of male sexuality, is often a crustacean or insectlike form. Woman with 
Her Throat Cut is a particularly vicious image: the body is splayed open, disemboweled, 
arched in a paroxysm of sex and death. Eros and Thanatos, seen here as a single theme, 
are distinguished and treated separately in two preparatory sketches (Collection Musee 
National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; repr. Rudenstine, p. 344, 
fig. b). 

Body parts are translated into schematic abstract forms like those in Cage of 
1930-31 (Collection Moderna Museet, Stockholm), which includes the spoon shape of 
the female torso, the rib and backbone motif, and the pod shape of the phallus. Here a 
vegetal form resembling the pelvic bone terminates one arm, and a phalluslike spindle, 
the only movable part, gruesomely anchors the other; the woman's backbone pins one 
leg by fusing with it; her slit carotid immobilizes her head. The memory of violence is 
frozen in the rigidity of rigor mortis. The psychological torment and the sadistic 
misogyny projected by this sculpture are in startling contrast to the serenity of other 
contemporaneous pieces by Giacometti, such as Woman Walking (plate 58). (L.F.)

Woman Walking 

(Femme qui marche) 

1932 

Plaster, 150 x 27.2 cm, including base 
76.2553 pg 132 



This sculpture is conceived in the rational and formally serene mode Alberto Giacometti 
pursued concurrently with his dark Surrealist explorations of the subconscious. Woman 
Walking has none of the ferocity of Woman with Her Throat Cut (plate 57), though 
both works were executed during the same period. The graceful, calm plaster seems to 
have its source in the frontal figures of ancient Egypt, posed with left feet slightly ahead 
of right in fearless confrontation of death. Despite the pose, Woman Walking, like its 
Egyptian ancestors, conveys no sense of movement. The plane of the body is only 
slightly inflected by the projections of breasts, belly, and thighs. The long, thin legs are 
smooth, solid, and columnar. In its flatness, the work evokes the traditions of the highly 
simplified Cycladic figure and the geometric kouros of archaic Greece. Giacometti is 
known to have copied works of art at the Louvre, during his travels, and even from 
reproductions, showing a preference for models characterized by a high degree of 
stylization. Woman Walking also reflects Giacometti's awareness of twentieth-century 
sculptors, particularly Constantin Brancusi and Alexander Archipenko. 

Another plaster version of the sculpture, also probably dating from 1932 (formerly 
Collection Erica Brausen, London), is distinguished by a triangular cavity in the upper 
abdomen.' The generalization and distortion of form in these works forecast Giacometti's 
development of the elongated style for which he is best known (see plate 5 9 ). ( L. F. )

(Femme debout ["Leoni"]) 

1947 (cast November 1957) 

Bronze, 153 cm high, including base 

76.2553 pg 134 



An early example of the mature style with which Giacometti is usually identified, this 
figure is more elongated and dematerialized than Woman Walking (plate 58), although 
it retains that sculpture's frontality and immobility. A sense of ghostly fragility detaches 
the figure from the world around it, despite the crusty materiality of the surfaces, as 
animated and responsive to light as those of Rodin. 

Giacometti exploited the contradictions of perception in the haunting, incorporeal 
sculptures of this period. His matchstick-sized figures of 1942-46 demonstrate the 
effect of distance on size and comment on the notion that the essence of an individual 
persists even as the body appears to vanish, that is, to become nonexistent. Even his 
large-scale standing women and striding men seem miniaturized and insubstantial. In 
1947 the sculptor commented that "lifesize figures irritate me, after all, because a 
person passing by on the street has no weight; in any case he's much lighter than the 
same person when he's dead or has fainted. He keeps his balance with his legs. You 
don't feel your weight. I wanted — without having thought about it — to reproduce this 
lightness, and that by making the body so thin." 1 Giacometti sought to convey several 
notions simultaneously in his attenuated plastic forms: one's consciousness of the 
nonmaterial presence of another person, the insubstantiality of the physical body 
housing that presence, and the paradoxical nature of perception. The base from which 
the woman appears to grow like a tree is tilted, emphasizing the verticality of the figure 
as well as reiterating the contours of the merged feet. 

Giacometti had the present cast made expressly for Peggy Guggenheim. (L. F.)

Piazza 

1947-48 (cast 1948-49) 

Bronze, 21 x 62.5 x 42.8 cm 

76.2553 pg 135 



In the late 1940s Alberto Giacometti produced attenuated thin figures not only of the 
life-size height of Standing Woman (plate 59), but also on the miniature scale of the 
figures who inhabit his Piazza of 1947-48. Four men stride across a wide plaza, each 
moving toward the center, yet none apparently directed toward an encounter with 
another. A single woman, whose stiff posture recalls Standing Woman, stands isolated 
and motionless near the center. The featureless figures exist independently within their 
haphazardly grouped unity, their multiple, nonconverging paths suggesting individual 
ambitions and absorptions. 

The flat bronze slab on which the figures stand serves both as base and as the plaza 
setting. Such a tabular format first appears in The Palace at 4 a.m., 1932-33 
(Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York), a highly theatrical work of 
Giacometti's Surrealist period. Giacometti began placing individual figures on large 
bases as early as 1942, but only in 1948, in Three Men Walking, did a group of 
attenuated figures appear on a thin square bronze base that also suggests a city square. 

Giacometti's scene derives from modern urban experience. He states: "In the street 
people astound and interest me more than any sculpture or painting. Every second the 
people stream together and go apart, then they approach each other to get closer to one 
another. They unceasingly form and re-form living compositions in unbelievable 
complexity. . . . It's the totality of this life that I want to reproduce in everything I 
do. . . .'" 

There are five different casts of this work, and a somewhat larger version with the 
figures placed in slightly different positions exists in five casts as well (Rudenstine, 
p. 354). In all of these sculptures, an eye-level examination of the work alters the scale 
of miniaturization first perceived by the viewer. The vastness of the empty piazza and 
the anonymity of the figures are revealed by such closeup scrutiny. (E. C. C.)

Promontory Palace 
(Palais promontoire) 

1931 

Oil on canvas, 73 x 60 cm 

76.2553 PG94 



Following his trip to Africa in 1930, Yves Tanguy produced a group of landscapes that 
have been termed les coulees (or flowing forms) for their molten character. Other paintings 
in this sequence include Neither Legends nor Figures, ca. 1930 (Private Collection, 
United States), and The Ar moire of Proteus, 193 1 (Private Collection, Paris). 1 Perhaps the 
most striking of the series is Promontory Palace, in which a rigid multitiered mass 
dominates a broad, flat plain. This corrugated mesa and other buttes in the center 
foreground stand firm as the surrounding viscous landscape succumbs to some persistent 
melting force. The small abstract shapes that inhabit the scene are in various stages of 
metamorphosis: some appear to melt or ooze, others seem to collapse or deflate, and still 
others secrete or sputter white liquids or gases. Some of these shapes are disturbingly 
anthropomorphic. A line of globular forms marches down the incline of the promontory 
to the edge of a cliff, where two forms have already surrendered and begun to melt over 
the precipice to join the sea of flowing matter below. A five-fingered, bulbous white 
mass glides over the ground as if on water. Elsewhere steam emerges, both from the pipe- 
shaped form at the base of the promontory and from the distant horizon. On the highest 
peak, or the palace, mysterious sparks emanate from a thornlike tower. To the right a 
hairlike apparition disappears into the thin atmosphere of an empty sky. 

In the natural world such geologic metamorphosis would require intense heat and 
volcanic activity. Yet Tanguy's restrained grays and muted pinks, accented with cool blue 
and pale green and yellow, deny the presence of fire and earth. Instead, Tanguy creates 
a Surrealist terrain where molten and frozen, figurative and abstract, literal and suggestive 
elements exist in perfect harmony. Tanguy's use of a specific horizon line, his naturalistic 
modeling of forms, and his depiction of landscape evocative of an actual coastline, permit 
us a conceptual foothold in known experience. Yet our foothold gives way as Tanguy's 
abstract shapes transform known experience into a familiar but irrational fantasy. The 
power of Tanguy's imagery derives from the delicate tension he creates between the logic 
of sensation and the freedom of imagination. (E.C.C.)

The Sun in Its Jewel Case 
(Le Soleil dans son ecrin) 

1937 

Oil on canvas, 115.4 x 88.1 cm 

76.2553 pg 95 



Yves Tanguy arrived at his lunar or submarine morphology in about 1927, and spent 
the rest of his artistic career exploring and elaborating it without changing its essential 
character. His compositions, arrived at in an unpremeditated manner directly on the 
canvas, recall the landscape of Locronan, in the French province of Brittany, where 
he spent childhood summers at a house owned by his parents. The repertory of memory 
was augmented by his experience of Africa during a trip of the early 1930s. After this 
the light in his paintings became clear and strong and the color schemes more complex. 
Vegetal forms were replaced by mineral formations. Dolmens and menhirs, stone 
remnants of prehistoric ages, and fossilized bones were smoothed and tinted in the 
dream spaces of his canvases. The assertive shadows cast in these landscapes recall those 
of Giorgio de Chirico, whose example had inspired Tanguy to take up painting in 1923. 

The spatial paradox of The Sun in Its Jewel Case depends on the merging of sky 
and earth, achieved through the continuous gradation of color over the surface — there 
is no horizon line — and the device of a diagonal line of forms shown receding in 
perspective from lower right to upper left. Acute angles are suggested throughout, by the 
placement of objects, by the relationship of shadows to objects, or by the things 
themselves. Geometric precision and a minutely detailed academic technique, in which 
careful modeling lends plastic solidity to form, heighten the poetic strangeness of 
Tanguy's world. (L.F.)

Voice of Space 

( La Voix des airs) 

1931 

Oil on canvas, 72.7 x 54.2 cm 

76.2553 pg 101 



Influenced by Giorgio de Chirico, Rene Magritte sought to strip objects of their usual 
functions and meanings in order to convey an irrationally compelling image. In Voice 
of Space (of which three other oil versions exist), the bells float in the air; elsewhere 
they occupy human bodies or replace blossoms on bushes. By distorting the scale, 
weight, and use of an ordinary object and inserting it into a variety of unaccustomed 
contexts, Magritte confers on that object a fetishistic intensity. He has written of the 
jingle bell, a motif that recurs often in his work: "I caused the iron bells hanging 
from the necks of our admirable horses to sprout like dangerous plants at the edge of 
an abyss.'" 

The disturbing impact of the bells presented in an unfamiliar setting is intensified by 
the cool academic precision with which they and their environment are painted. The 
dainty slice of landscape could be the backdrop of an early Renaissance painting, while 
the bells themselves, in their rotund and glowing monumentality, impart a mysterious 
resonance. (L. F.)

In Empire of Light, numerous versions of which exist (see, for example, those at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts de 
Belgique, Brussels), a dark, nocturnal street scene is set against a pastel-blue, light- 
drenched sky spotted with fluffy cumulus clouds. With no fantastic element other than 
the single paradoxical combination of day and night, Rene Magritte upsets a 
fundamental organizing premise of life. Sunlight, ordinarily the source of clarity, here 
causes the confusion and unease traditionally associated with darkness. The luminosity 
of the sky becomes unsettling, making the empty darkness below even more 
impenetrable than it would seem in a normal context. The bizarre subject is treated in 
an impersonal, precise style, typical of veristic Surrealist painting and preferred by 
Magritte since the mid- 19 20s. (L. F.)

SALVADOR DALI 



Birth of Liquid Desires 
(La Naissance des desirs liquides) 

1931-32 
Oil and collage on canvas, 96.1 x 11 2.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 100 



By the time Salvador Dali joined the Surrealist group in 1929, he had formulated his 
"paranoid-critical" approach to art, which consisted in conveying his deepest 
psychological conflicts to the viewer in the hopes of eliciting an empathetic response. 
He embodied this theoretical approach in a fastidiously detailed painting style. One of 
his hallucinatory obsessions was the legend of William Tell, which represented for him 
the archetypal theme of paternal assault. 1 The subject occurs frequently in his paintings 
from 1929, when he entered into a liaison with Gala Eluard, his future wife, against his 
father's wishes. Dali felt an acute sense of rejection during the early 1930s because of 
his father's attitude toward him. 

Here father, son, and perhaps mother seem to be fused in the grotesque dream-image 
of the hermaphroditic creature at center. William Tell's apple is replaced by a loaf of 
bread, with attendant castration symbolism. (Elsewhere Dali uses a lamb chop to 
suggest his father's cannibalistic impulses.) Out of the bread arises a lugubrious cloud 
vision inspired by the imagery of Arnold Bocklin. In one of the recesses of this cloud is 
an enigmatic inscription in French: "Consigne: gacher l'ardoise totale?" 

Reference to the remote past seems to be made in the two forlorn figures shown in 
the distant left background, which may convey Dali's memory of the fond communion 
of father and child. The infinite expanse of landscape recalls Yves Tanguy's work of the 
1920s. The biomorphic structure dominating the composition suggests at once a violin, 
the weathered rock formations of Port Lligat on the eastern coast of Spain, the 
architecture of the Catalan visionary Antoni Gaudi, the sculpture of Jean Arp, a 
prehistoric monster, and an artist's palette. The form has an antecedent in Dali's own 
work in the gigantic vision of his mother in The Enigma of Desire of 1929 (Collection 
Staatsgalerie Moderner Kunst, Munich). The repressed, guilty desire of the central 
figure is indicated by its attitude of both protestation and arousal toward the forbidden 
flower-headed woman (presumably Gala). The shadow darkening the scene is cast by 
an object outside the picture and may represent the father's threatening presence, or a 
more general prescience of doom, the advance of age, or the extinction of life. (I . F.)

The Break of Day 

(L'Aurore) 

July 1937 

Oil on canvas, 120 x 150.5 cm 

76.2553 pg 103 



Like his compatriot Rene Magritte, Paul Delvaux applied a fastidious, detailed 
technique to scenes deriving their impact from unsettling incongruities of subject. 
Influenced by Giorgio de Chirico, he frequently included classicizing details and used 
perspectival distortion to create rapid, plunging movement from foreground to deep 
background. Unique to Delvaux is the silent, introspective cast of figures he developed 
during the mid-i930s. His formidable, buxom nude or seminude women pose 
immobile with unfocused gazes, their arms frozen in rhetorical gestures, dominating a 
world through which men, preoccupied and timid, unobtrusively make their way. 

Although the fusion of woman and tree in the present picture invites comparison 
with Greek mythological subjects, the artist has insisted that no such references were 
intended (Rudenstine, p. 216). The motif of the mirror appears in 1936 in works such 
as Woman in a Grotto (Collection Thyssen-Bornemisza, Lugano) and The Mirror 
(formerly Collection Roland Penrose, London; destroyed during World War II). In The 
Break of Day a new element is introduced; the reflected figure is not present within the 
scene, but exists outside the canvas field. She is, therefore, in some sense, the viewer, 
even if that viewer should happen to be male. The irony of the circumstance in which a 
clothed male viewer could see himself reflected as a nude female torso would have 
particularly appeared to Marcel Duchamp, who appropriated the detail of the mirror in 
his collage of 1942 In the Manner of Delvaux (Collection Vera and Arturo Schwarz, 
Milan; repr. Rudenstine, p. 217). (L.F.)

VICTOR BRAUNER 



The Surrealist 

(Le Surrealiste) 

January 1947 

Oil on canvas, 60 x 45 cm 

76.2553 PG III 



In The Surrealist Victor Brauner borrows motifs from the tarot to create a portrait of 
himself as a young man. The tarot, a set of seventy-eight illustrated cards used in 
fortune telling, was a subject of widespread interest to Brauner and other Surrealists. 
Four of these cards, for example, appeared on Andre Derain's cover for the December 
1933 issue of Minotaure. A group including Brauner even produced a deck of cards in 
1940-41 that was probably a tarot. One tarot card, the Juggler (the first card in the 
Marseille tarot deck; repr. Rudenstine, p. 135), provided Brauner with a key prototype 
for his self-portrait: the Surrealist's large hat, medieval costume, and the position of his 
arms all derive from this figure who, like Brauner's subject, stands behind a table 
displaying a knife, a goblet, and coins.' The tarot Juggler appropriately symbolizes the 
creativity of the Surrealist poet, for it refers to the capacity of each individual to create 
his own personality through intelligence, wit, and initiative, and thus to play with his 
own future, as the juggler manipulates his baton. 

In another tarot deck known as the Waite tarot, the first card of the Major Arcana is 
the Magician rather than the Juggler, although both share many attributes. A sign of 
infinity, °° (the symbol of life), that appears above the Magician's head is also depicted 
on the hat of Brauner's Surrealist. Drawing on the Juggler-Magician prototype, Brauner 
illustrates the traditional signs of the four suits in the tarot deck: wands, cups, swords, 
and coins (symbols of the elements of natural life — fire, water, air, and earth, 
respectively). These objects and all natural life are controlled by the Juggler, just as all 
creative life is at the disposal of the Surrealist poet, who wields his pen as the Juggler 
brandishes his wand. 

Brauner depicted the Juggler and a Popess (a figure from the Marseille Tarot) in 
another painting of 1947, The Lovers (Private Collection, Paris). The inscriptions at 
either side of that canvas, Fast— Present— Future and Fate/Necessity— Will/Magic — 
Surreality/Liherty, are written in Brauner's hand on the back of the Peggy Guggenheim 
canvas. These inscriptions convey the artist's belief that Surrealism could be a path to 
artistic freedom. (E. C. C.)

offer the most complete discussion of this tarot iconography.

ALEXANDER CALDER 



Mobile 

1941 

Painted aluminum, approximately 214 cm high 

76.2553 pg 137 



During the early 1930s Alexander Calder, a pioneering figure in the development of 
kinetic art, created sculptures in which balanced components move, some driven by 
motor and others impelled by the action of air currents. Marcel Duchamp first applied 
the descriptive designation "mobiles" to those reliant on air alone. Either suspended or 
freestanding, these constructions generally consist of flat pieces of painted metal 
connected by wire veins and stems. Their biomorphic shapes recall the organic motifs 
of the Surrealist painting and sculpture of his friends Joan Miro and Jean Arp. Calder, a 
fastidious craftsman, cut, bent, punctured, and twisted his materials entirely by hand, 
the manual emphasis contributing to the sculptures' evocation of natural form. Shape, 
size, color, space, and movement combine and recombine in shifting, balanced 
relationships that provide a visual equivalent to the harmonious but unpredictable 
activity of nature. 

The present mobile is organized as an antigravitational cascade, in which large, 
heavy, mature shapes sway serenely at the top, while small, undifferentiated, agitated, 
new growth dips and rocks below. Calder left one leaf unpainted, revealing the 
aluminum surface and underscoring the sense of variety he considered vital to the 
success of a work of art. As he wrote: "Disparity in form, color, size, weight, motion, 
is what makes a composition. ... It is the apparent accident to regularity which the 
artist actually controls by which he makes or mars a work."' (L. F.)

ALEXANDER CALDER 



Silver Bedhead 
Winter 1945-46 

Silver, 160 x 131 cm 
76.2553 pg 138 



In New York in the winter of 1945-46, Peggy Guggenheim commissioned Alexander 
Calder to make a silver bedhead. 1 His design combines fish, insect, and plant motifs in 
an exuberant conflation of the worlds of sea and garden. The two fish at the lower left 
are free-hanging elements. Calder also suspended an insect, probably a bee or 
dragonfly, from a silver link chain that may be dangled from various locations on the 
sculpture. Since the insect may fly in any of several possible positions, realms of sea and 
sky are not separated into distinct areas — rather, the bedhead is a whimsical fantasy in 
which flora and fauna from both regions coexist. The outer curve of a large spiral 
comprises the basic circular structure of the bedhead, which is elaborated with 
decorations of hammered and cut silver. Although these botanical forms are fixed 
permanently in position, their curving, twisting contours nonetheless convey a sense of 
perpetual natural motion. 

Calder first twisted wire into three-dimensional forms in his wire sculptures of the 
mid-i92os. Subsequently, he twisted, cut, and hammered wire and gold, silver and 
brass into jewelry for his friends and patrons. It has been suggested that the delicate 
and slender forms of some of Calder's metal constructions of the early 1940s are 
indebted to his jewelry of the 1930s, which included both simple animal motifs and 
curvilinear or spiraling abstract forms. 2 Calder's book illustrations also contributed to 
the development of a graphic lyricism in his sculpture. Many of the vegetal forms in the 
bedhead share the spontaneity and inventiveness of Calder's line-etching illustrations. 
In particular, the soaring zigzag fern motif on the left and the numerous spiral-shaped 
blossoms anticipate the illustrations executed in 1946 for Eunice Clark's Fables of La 
Fontaine (for example, the "Stag and the Vine"). 

The compressed, shallow relief of this piece answers neatly the practical demands of 
Guggenheim's commission for a bedhead. This project allowed Calder to exercise his 
calligraphic skills not only in the more conventional realm of book illustration but also 
in drawing on a blank wall with a line of silver metal. The worked surface of the 
hammered silver, which reflects light in countless directions, adds variety and a three- 
dimensional presence to each of Calder's lines. (E. C. C.)

Fortune Telling Parrot (Parrot Music Box 

Ca. 1937-38 

Box construction, 40.8 x 22.2 x 17 cm 

76.2553 pg 126 



Joseph Cornell lived an isolated life with his mother at their home in Flushing, New York, 
from which he made frequent excursions into Manhattan to gather objects for his 
constructions. His diaries record his alternating feelings of being trapped at home, and 
then of release when he escaped to Manhattan. Working on his boxes at home in his cellar 
became a substitute for traveling, the arrangement of imaginary souvenirs inducing the 
excitement of voyages. 

Fortune Telling Parrot offers many associations with exotic travels. First, the box 
construction itself resembles the apparatus of a hurdy-gurdy, invoking the bohemian 
world of the traveling gypsy musician. The crank on the right exterior of the 
construction turns a broken music box, hidden in the lower-right corner of the 
sculpture. The music box in turn is attached by a thin rod to the cylinder above it, 
which is intended to revolve while music plays. 

The cylinder is covered with decorations, some of which suggest the paraphernalia 
and practices of the fortune-teller: playing cards such as the King of Hearts and the 
Jack of Clubs; the numbers one through nine; a picture of two hands playing cat's 
cradle, recalling the entertainments of the gypsy; and the picture of a gypsy woman in 
elaborate costume. Small stars on the cylinder and a map of the constellation of Ursa 
Minor, "Little Bear," in the lower-left corner of the box, also allude to astrology and 
divination. The parrot itself is a common attribute of the itinerant fortune-teller. 
Facing the revolving canister, this bird assumes the role of a soothsayer's assistant. 
Exotic birds, including parrots, parakeets, and cockatoos, appear in some eighteen 
boxes by Cornell, the present example being the earliest and the others dating from the 
forties and fifties (Rudenstine, p. 178). In other boxes, birds are caged and chained on 
their perches, captured as exotic pets. Cornell recalls in his diary some of the 
experiences that contributed to his obsession with parrots: "magic windows of 
yesterday . . . pet shop windows splashed with white tropical plumage / the kind of 
revelation symptomatic of city wanderings in another era. . . . scintillating songs of 
Rossini and Bellini and the whole golden age of the bel canto . . . indelible childhood 
memory of an old German woman a neighbor's pet parrot may have added to the 
obsession of these . . . feathered friends."' (E. C. C.)

Box construction, 35.5 x 30.6 x 11.1 cm 

76.2553 pg 128 



Joseph Cornell's obsession with the collection, isolation, combination, and preservation 
of found objects is revealed in a fastidiously compartmentalized form in the Pharmacy 
boxes of the 1940s and 1950s. Like Marcel Duchamp's Box in a Valise of 1941 (an 
example of which is in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection), this work is a miniature 
museum dedicated to the protection and presentation of its contents. The care with 
which the collection has been selected and displayed invests it with a potency the 
individual objects do not ordinarily convey.' 

Each apothecary jar presents a diorama of poetically allusive natural or man-made 
forms. The natural world is present in sand, stones, shells, plant and insect parts, 
feathers, and wood; the constructed world appears in mechanisms, toys, maps, and 
prints. The environments invoked range from the seashore, where man's importance is 
negligible, to the Renaissance palace, one of the most sophisticated expressions of his 
material and intellectual achievement. Like the alchemist, Cornell transforms ordinary 
objects into precious things; in one jar he even seems to have fulfilled the ultimate 
alchemical aspiration of transmuting base metal into gold. By presenting these 
inviolable jars in a pharmaceutical context, he may also allude to the universal 
restorative powers that alchemists hoped to discover. The mirroring of the back wall of 
the box, typical of apothecaries' cabinets, multiplies the contents and reflects the 
viewer, whom it affords the unexpected opportunity to study the reverse of objects 
without moving around them. (L. F.)

Oil on canvas, 167 x 178.2 cm

Arshile Gorky spent the greater part of 1944 at Crooked Run Farm in Hamilton, 
Virginia, where he produced a large number of drawings, many of which were conceived 
as preliminary studies for paintings. This work is preceded by such a study, a closely 
related untitled drawing of 1944 (Private Collection; repr. Rudenstine, p. 669, fig. a) 
that sets out its motifs, their ordering within the composition, and the arrangement of 
color. Apart from the transformation of an empty contour at the upper center into a 
solid, anchored black form, only insignificant compositional and coloristic changes 
appear in the finished painting. 

Gorky's enthusiastic response to the natural surroundings of rural Virginia infused 
his work with expressive freedom. Landscape references appear in Untitled; though the 
white ground is uniform, it is empty at the very top of the canvas, suggesting a slice of 
sky, while the "earth" below is replete with vegetal shapes and floral colors. A clear 
gravitational sense is produced by the dripping of paint thinned with turpentine, a 
technique suggested by Matta. As in They Will Take My Island of the same year 
(Collection Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto), an aggressive diagonal accent cuts through 
the upper center of the canvas. 

The techniques and content of Surrealism influenced the development of Gorky's 
language of free, organic, vitally curvilinear forms. Joan Miro's example is particularly 
evident here, in the disposition of floating abstract units on an indeterminate background, 
and in details such as flamelike shapes, dotted ovals, and suggestions of genitals. Unlike 
Miro, however, Gorky enmeshes his forms with one another to create the overall 
structure. Textured, insubstantial clouds of color occasionally pertain to the graphic form 
they accompany, but more often are independent elements, as in the work of Vasily 
Kandinsky. The curves, inflection, and directionality of Gorky's line likewise free it from 
descriptive function. In his emphasis on the autonomous expressive potential of line, 
form, and color, Gorky anticipated the concerns of Abstract Expressionism. ( L. F. )

The Moon Woman 

1942 

Oil on canvas, 175.2 x 109.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 141 



Like other members of the New York School, Jackson Pollock was influenced in his 
early work by Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso, and seized on the Surrealists' concept of 
the unconscious as the source of art. In the late 1930s Pollock introduced imagery 
based on totemic or mythic figures, ideographic signs, and ritualistic events, which 
have been interpreted as pertaining to the buried experiences and cultural memories of 
the psyche. 

The Moon Woman suggests the example of Picasso, particularly his Girl Before a 
Mirror of 1932 (Collection The Museum of Modern Art, New York). The palettes are 
similar, and both artists describe a solitary standing female as if she had been x-rayed, 
her backbone a broad black line from which her curving contours originate. Frontal 
and profile views of the face are combined to contrast two aspects of the self, one 
serene and public, the other dark and interior. 

The subject of the moon woman, which Pollock treated in several drawings and 
paintings of the early 1940s, could have been available to him from various sources. At 
this time many artists, among them Pollock's friends William Baziotes and Robert 
Motherwell, were influenced by the fugitive, hallucinatory imagery of Charles Baudelaire 
and the French Symbolists. In his prose poem "Favors of the Moon" Baudelaire addresses 
the "image of the fearful goddess, the fateful godmother, the poisonous nurse of all the 
moonstruck of the world." The poem, which is known to have inspired Baziotes's Mirror 
at Midnight, completed in 1942 (Collection Rudi Blesh, New York), alludes to "ominous 
flowers that are like the censers of an unknown rite," a phrase uncannily applicable 
to Pollock's bouquet at the upper right. Although it is possible that Pollock knew the 
poem, it is likelier that he was affected in a more general way by the interest in Baudelaire 
and the Symbolists that was pervasive during the period. (L. F.)

JACKSON POLLOCK 



Circumcision 

January 1946 

Oil on canvas, 142.3 x 168 cm 

76.2553 pg 145 



In this transitional work of 1946 the subtle persistence of the Cubist grid system is felt in 
the panels that organize the composition and orient major pictorial details in vertical or 
horizontal positions. However, Jackson Pollock's dependence on Pablo Picasso has 
virtually dissolved, giving way to a more automatic, fluidly expressive style. Line loses its 
descriptive function and begins to assume a self-sufficient role, the rhythm, duration, and 
direction of each brushstroke responding to the artist's instinctual gesture. The 
compositional focus is multiplied and decentralized and areas of intense activity fill the 
entire surface. Fragmented figural elements are increasingly integrated into the shallow 
pictorial space, as background, foreground, and object merge and the texture of the paint 
gains in importance. By 1945 tne vigor and originality of Pollock's work had prompted 
the critic Clement Greenberg, one of his earliest champions, to write in The Nation of 
April 7: "Jackson Pollock's second one-man show at Art of This Century . . . establishes 
him, in my opinion, as the strongest painter of his generation and perhaps the greatest 
one to appear since Miro." 

Primitive art forms are alluded to in the crudely drawn arrows, cult and stick figures, 
and ornamental markings discernable in Circumcision. Totemic figures (the rotund being 
standing at the left and the owl-like creature at upper center) are posed stiffly, observing 
what seems to be a scene of violence in the center of the canvas. The enactment of a rite of 
passage is suggested, but the visual evidence does not encourage a specific reading. 
Pollock's concern with archetypal imagery and pancultural rituals and mythologies is 
evoked with varying degrees of specificity in his work. 

Lee Krasner suggested the title to Pollock after the painting was completed 
(see Rudenstine, pp. 634-35). ( LF -)

Eyes in the Heat 

1946 

Oil (and enamel?) on canvas, 137.2 x 109.2 cm 

76.2553 pg 149 



Eyes in the Heat heralds the poured paintings Jackson Pollock initiated in the winter of 
1946-47. It is part of Sounds in the Grass, a series of seven canvases that also includes 
Croaking Movement in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. Pollock had moved to a 
house on Long Island in 1945, an ^ early the next summer began using one of the 
bedrooms as a studio. Later in 1946 he arranged with Peggy Guggenheim to have a 
show at her Art of This Century gallery, to open in January of 1947; in preparation for 
this exhibition he worked with great intensity on Sounds in the Grass and the series 
Accabonac Creek. 

Visible effects of the move from New York City to the more rural environment of 
East Hampton were a lightening of palette and the introduction of themes alluding to 
nature. Although the light and flora and fauna of Long Island are evoked in a general 
sense in Eyes in the Heat, particularized figurative references are almost entirely 
submerged in the layers of impasto that build up the surface. Pollock no longer applies 
paint with a brush, but squeezes pigment onto the canvas directly from the tube, 
pushing and smearing it with blunt instruments to create a thick, textured crust. One's 
gaze is carried along broad swaths of color that swoop, careen, double back, rise, and 
fall rhythmically over the entire canvas. The watchful eyes of creatures concealed in the 
paint appear here and there, in their proliferation mimicking the restless movement of 
the viewer's eyes. (L. F.)

JACKSON POLLOCK 

Alchemy 

1947 
Oil, aluminum (and enamel?) paint, and string on canvas, 114.6 x 221.3 cm 

76.2553 pg 150 



Alchemy is one of Jackson Pollock's earliest poured paintings, executed in the 
revolutionary technique that constituted his most significant contribution to twentieth- 
century art. After long deliberation before the empty canvas, he used his entire body 
in a picture-making process that can be described as drawing in paint. By pouring 
streams of commercial paint onto the canvas from a can with the aid of a stick, 
Pollock made obsolete the conventions and tools of traditional easel painting. He often 
tacked the unstretched canvas onto the floor in an approach he likened to that of the 
Navajo Indian sandpainters, explaining that "on the floor I am more at ease. I feel 
nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the 
four sides and literally be in the painting." 1 Surrealist notions of chance and 
automatism are given full expression in Pollock's classic poured paintings, in which line 
no longer serves to describe shape or enclose form, but exists as an autonomous event, 
charting the movements of the artist's body. As the line thins and thickens it speeds and 
slows, its appearance modified by chance behavior of the medium such as bleeding, 
pooling, or blistering. 

When Alchemy is viewed from a distance, its large scale and even emphasis 
encourage the viewer to experience the painting as an environment. The layering and 
interpenetration of the labyrinthine skeins give the whole a dense and generalized 
appearance. The textured surface is like a wall on which primitive signs are inscribed 
with white pigment squeezed directly from the tube. Interpretations of these markings 
have frequently relied on the title Alchemy; however, this was assigned not by Pollock, 
but by Ralph Manheim and his wife, neighbors of the Pollocks in East Hampton. (L. F.)

JACKSON POLLOCK 



Enchanted Forest 

1947 

Oil on canvas, 221.3 x n 4-6 cm 

76.2553 pg 151 



Like Alchemy (plate 76), Enchanted Forest exemplifies Jackson Pollock's mature 
abstract compositions created by the pouring, dripping, and splattering of paint on 
large, unstretched canvases. In Enchanted Forest Pollock opens up the more dense 
construction of layered color found in works such as Alchemy by allowing large areas 
of white to breathe amidst the network of moving, expanding line. He also reduces his 
palette to a restrained selection of gold, black, red, and white. Pollock creates a delicate 
balance of form and color through orchestrating syncopated rhythms of lines that 
surge, swell, retreat, and pause only briefly before plunging anew into continuous, 
lyrical motion. One's eye follows eagerly, pursuing first one dripping rope of color and 
then another, without being arrested by any dominant focus. Rather than describing a 
form, Pollock's line thus becomes continuous form itself. 

Michael Fried has described Pollock's achievement: "[His] all-over line does not give 
rise to positive and negative areas. There is no inside or outside to Pollock's line or to 
the space through which it moves. And that is tantamount to claiming that line, in 
Pollock's all-over drip paintings of 1947-50, has been freed at last from the job of 
describing contours and bounding shapes.'" It is this redefinition of the traditional 
capacity of the artist's formal means that distinguishes Pollock's art in the history of 
Modernism. (E.C.C.)

WILLIAM BAZIOTES 



The Room 

1945 

Gouache on board, 45.6 x 61 cm 

76.2553 pg 156 



William Baziotes and other members of the New York School were influenced by the 
European Surrealists who had fled to the United States during World War II. Like 
the Surrealists, Baziotes used objects in his environment as triggers for the memory of 
early sensations or as conduits to the unconscious. This procedure produced in him 
an acutely sensitized state of mind that he attempted to formulate visually in his 
paintings. Baziotes saw this visual manifestation of states of mind as parallel to the 
literary achievement of the Symbolist poets and of Marcel Proust, whose work he 
much admired. 

Baziotes makes allusions in his paintings to the external world of objects, but these 
remain elusive and changeable. He usually added his titles after the compositions had 
emerged through intuitive decisions. Although the titles do not identify subject matter, 
they nevertheless guide interpretation. Thus, the title of the present work may 
encourage one to experience the mood of an interior space illuminated by diffused 
twilight. An atmosphere of nostalgic reverie is evoked by scumbled, weathered layers of 
gouache in which pastel colors predominate. Unlike Baziotes's most characteristic 
works, in which biomorphic shapes float freely on an indefinite background, The Room 
is constructed architectonically. The gridded structure derives from Piet Mondrian and 
the Cubists, models for Baziotes before his encounter with the Surrealists. (L. F.) 



PLATE 79 



ROBERT MOTHERWELL 



Personage (Autoportrait) 

December 9, 1943 

Paper collage, gouache, and ink on board, 103.8 x 65.9 cm 

76.2553 pg 155 



In 1943 Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock experimented with collage in response 
to Peggy Guggenheim's initial preparations for a show of works in the medium at Art 
of This Century. The exhibition was to include examples by the foremost European 
practitioners, such as Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Kurt Schwitters. Though 
Pollock's interest in the technique soon waned, Motherwell's concern with it endured. 
Personage (Autoportrait) (which has previously been known as Surprise and 
Inspiration , a title assigned by Guggenheim or someone in her circle 1 ) was one of 
several important examples Motherwell produced in 1943-44. 

Motherwell acknowledged that the work might, in a sense, evoke an embodiment of 
self-image (Rudenstine, pp. 585-86). Although a blocky, somewhat mournful figure can 
be imagined, Personage (Autoportrait) is more readily perceived as a nonreferential 
coloristic and spatial construction. A jagged horizontal-vertical mesh organizes the 
composition. The alignment of the edges of the cut, torn, and glued paper provides the 
grid, which has a physical, planar dimension. Not only does the paper structure the 
work architectonically, but it serves as a support for vigorously applied paint. The 
energy of handling and the uneven oval shapes separated by a black line in this early 
collage foreshadow the powerful facture and recurrent motifs of Motherwell's later 
work. (L.F.)

MARK ROTHKO 



Sacrifice 

April 1946 

Watercolor, gouache, and india ink on paper, 100.2 x 65.8 cm 

76.2553 pg 154 



During the late 1930s and early 1940s Mark Rothko, like William Baziotes, Adolph 
Gottlieb, and Theodoros Stamos, combined mythical themes with primordial imagery 
in order to express universal experiences. In his work of this period evanescent 
biomorphic shapes float within an atmospheric haze. Resembling rudimentary life 
forms or primitive subaquatic plants and creatures, these shapes are intended to 
provide a visible equivalent of images lodged in the subconscious. Though he drew 
primarily on his innermost sensations, Rothko also looked toward earlier art. The 
example of Joan Miro is evoked in Sacrifice in the dotted line, the flame, the amorphic 
personage at the lower left, and in the meandering threadlike tendrils. 

Figurative and literary allusions, albeit disguised, persist here. Architectural elements 
contrast with the aquatic forms and nebulous milieu: the horizontal registers are 
articulated like moldings, as in an untitled oil painting by Rothko of 1939-40 
(Collection Mr. and Mrs. Richard E. Lang, Medina, Washington), in which a frieze of 
faces appears between an undulating cornice and two ornamental tiers. The title may 
be inspired by Rothko's interest in Greek tragedy and Friedrich Nietzsche's 
examination of its origins. Despite the persistence of these references, overtly 
representational images have disappeared, signaling a move toward the complete 
abstraction of Rothko's mature style. In its horizontal zoning, cloudlike texture, and 
blurred contours, Sacrifice anticipates his characteristic, fully evolved color-field 
paintings. (L.F.) 



PLATE 8l 



CLYFFORD STILL 



Jamais 

May 1944 

Oil on canvas, 165.2 x 82 cm 

76.2553 pg 153 



Like the examples of William Baziotes, Robert Motherwell, and Mark Rothko in the 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection (plates 78-80), Jamais dates from the formative, 
exploratory period of Abstract Expressionism. Although the influence of Surrealism 
pervaded the work of these artists in the early forties, they were moving toward 
distinctive independent styles. 

Until 1946-47 the single upright figure dominated Clyfford Still's painting. In its 
elongation and expressionistic distortion, this element is reminiscent of figures painted 
by Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso in the 1930s. Here the figure is barely particularized, 
appearing as a black flame or cleft in the blazing environment that surrounds it. Later it 
was to disappear entirely within the craggy, tenebrous abstractions for which Still is 
best known. The sphere, which interrupts the thrusting verticality of his tense lines in 
several of these early works, was also to vanish. Concern with the contrast of light and 
dark was to become increasingly important and was emphasized by jarring color 
juxtapositions. The canvas, already large in this example, was to reach monumental 
proportions and create an impact rivaling that of the viewer's own environment. 

The present painting is one of the few by Still bearing its original title. He disdained 
titles, and discarded those he had given to early works because he considered that 
they too strongly influenced the observer's experience of the painting. Indeed, Jamais 
(French for "never") lends an air of finality and melancholy to this scene and 
encourages one to read the figure as howling in protest or despair above a setting sun.

WILLEM DE KOONING 



Untitled 

1958 

Oil on paper, mounted on Masonite, mounted on wood, 58.5 x 74 cm 

76.2553 pg 158 



Willem de Kooning, like Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell, was a leader in the 
development of Abstract Expressionism, an American movement strongly influenced by 
European Surrealist notions of automatism and free expression. De Kooning does not 
use preliminary studies but paints directly on the support, manipulating pigment in 
vigorous, uninhibited gestures, expressing his subjective apprehensions of the material 
world in both figurative and abstract compositions. During the late fifties he 
temporarily abandoned the depiction of the human figure, which had preoccupied him 
since the beginning of his career, to evoke parkway and urban landscapes in abstract 
terms. As he wrote: "The pictures done since the Women, they're emotions, most of 
them. Most of them are landscapes and highways and sensations of that, outside the 
city, or coming from it." 1 The quality of light and the freshness of color in the present 
painting communicate a sense of landscape. Nevertheless, the subject relates, however 
indirectly, to the artist's obsession with the image of woman, whose contours he has 
sublimated in abstract natural forms; it is present here in the flesh tones and the lithe 
curves playing against an implied grid. 

In the late fifties de Kooning reduced the frenzied proliferation of stroke, form, and 
plane that had characterized his preceding work to effect compositions of relative 
restraint and clarity. Each area of color, contoured only by the physical edges of the 
paint, is applied expansively. The broad simplification makes conspicuous the manner 
of paint application and the resultant textural complexities of the medium. Movement, 
conflict, and resolution take place on the flat surface of the canvas, while shifting 
penetrations into an illusory depth are made by color areas that advance and recede 
according to value, overlap, or shading. (L. F.)

PLATE 83 
RUFINO TAMAYO 

Heavenly Bodies 

1946 

Oil with sand on canvas, 86.3 x 105 cm 

76.2553 pg 119 



Rufino Tamayo filtered his pre-Colombian heritage through the pictorial tradition of 
European Modernism in images of man's confrontation with the forces of nature and 
the universe. In several paintings of 1946-47 he showed primitive figures gesticulating 
in terror, awe, or longing at the patterns of astral and planetary orbits. 

The lines traversing the sky in Heavenly Bodies may represent light emanating from 
stars or the tails of meteors, and may also indicate the mental constructs that join stars 
in constellations. These lines dissect the rich blue sky into flat planes and 
simultaneously provide the illusion of movement through a vast space. The purity of 
the sky's geometry is contrasted with the unevenly curving contours of the human 
figure, associated formally with the earth. A setting sun is evoked by the red strip on 
the hill and is reflected on the man's face. While bearing some relation to Mexican folk 
art, the treatment of the figure derives more directly from the work of Pablo Picasso. 
The combination of frontal and profile view, the gaping mouth and conical eye, the 
shorthand outlining of the face and outstretched childlike hand have analogies in works 
such as Picasso's Guernica of 1937 (Collection Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina 
Sofia, Madrid), which Tamavo had occasion to see in New York. (L. F.) 



PLATE 84 



HENRY MOORE 



Three Standing Figures 

1953 

Bronze, 73.2 x 68 x 29 cm, including base 

76.2553 pg 194 



In its abstraction of the human figure and exaggeration of isolated anatomical features, 
this work is related to African sculpture and to the Surrealist sculpture of Pablo Picasso 
and Alberto Giacometti. Within Henry Moore's own body of work, Three Standing 
Figures can be seen in connection with the "shelter" drawings of the early 1940s, in 
which the artist explored the psychological interaction of groups, and with the 
monumental Three Standing Figures of 1947-49 erected at Battersea Park in London. 
Classicizing elements of the latter, however remote, endure in the Peggy Guggenheim 
work. The grouping of three figures, their contrapposto stances, the variety of 
rhetorical gestures, and the echoes of drapery creases and swags provide visual 
analogies with ancient sources. Typically, Moore conflates the human figure with the 
forms of inanimate natural materials such as bone and rock. The perforations through 
the mass of the sculptured bodies suggest a slow process of erosion by water or wind. 

At least three preparatory drawings exist for Three Standing Figures, which was cast 
in bronze from a plaster original in an edition of eight, with one artist's proof 
(discussed and repr. Rudenstine, p. 580). A ten-inch maquette preceding it in 1952 was 
also cast in bronze. Neither of the original plasters survives. Moore used bronze 
increasingly from the late 1940s; he commented on its greater flexibility in comparison 
with stone, and its relative strength in withstanding the action of the elements. (L. F.)

BEN NICHOLSON 



February 1956 (menhir) 

1956 

Oil (and ink?) on board, 99.4 x 30 cm 

76.2553 PG46 



In the early thirties Ben Nicholson began carving reliefs. By 1934 these were composed 
of circular and rectilinear elements that he painted white. The first series was completed 
in 1939. When Nicholson focused again on the form in the mid-1950s, the reliefs 
became subtly varied in coloration and texture. The present example is particularly 
severe, the absence of curved or diagonal lines recalling the work of Piet Mondrian, 
whom Nicholson knew and admired. The muted, chalky color evokes early Italian 
Renaissance frescoes and shards of classical pottery. 

The parenthetical menhir (Breton for "long stone") in the title refers to the simple 
prehistoric stone slabs found throughout western Europe, especially in Brittany. The 
association is reinforced by the vertical format and the hewn monochromatic surface of 
the board. The balance of shape, proportion, and placement, apparently so simple, is 
achieved adroitly. The thickness of the central rectangle decreases gradually from top 
to bottom, so that the form projects where it meets the upper rectangle, while lying 
flush above the lower rectangle. This manipulation produces a tapering shadow that 
softens the strictly perpendicular alignment of the relief to produce a work of austere 
harmonv. (L. F.)

GERMAINE RICHIER 



Tauromachy 
(Tauromachie) 

1953 
Bronze, figure n 1.5 cm high; base 95.7 x 52.5 X3 cm 

76.2553 PG 205 



Germaine Richier's investigation of the composition and decomposition of organic 
materials situates her work in the vitalist current of twentieth-century sculpture, which 
concerns itself with natural processes. In an assault on closed form, she breaks through 
her heavily worked surfaces to expose the structural armature and hollow spaces within 
the bodies they describe. 

In subject matter and style this sculpture recalls both Pablo Picasso's Surrealist 
bullfight imagery of the 1930s and his sculptures of the early 1950s. Richier, who was 
herself familiar with the bullfight, shared with Picasso an interest in its mythic, archaic 
implications.' In addition, the robust three-dimensionality, raw surfaces, and 
incorporation of found objects in Tauromachy may constitute a response to works such 
as Picasso's She-Goat of 1950 and Goat Skull and Bottle of 1951-52. Like Henry 
Moore during the same year (see plate 84), Richier places her forms in situational 
relationships. As she wrote: "Finally, the sculpture is a place, an entity, a synthesis of 
movements. I don't know if the Tauromachy evokes the sand, but no form, it seems to 
me, can be separated from the universe, the elements. It is therefore something more 
than an image." 2 

This bronze was produced in an edition of ten. (L. F. )

FRANCIS BACON 



Study for Chimpanzee 

March 1957 

Oil and pastel on canvas, 152.4 x 1 17 cm 

76.2553 pg 172 



Although Francis Bacon is best known for his alienated and often hideously distorted 
human figures, animals are the subject of at least a dozen of his canvases. He rarely 
worked from nature, preferring photographs, and for images of animals he often 
consulted Eadweard Muybridge's Animals in Motion, Marius Maxwell's Stalking Big 
Game with a Camera in Equatorial Africa, and pictures from zoological parks. 
Intrigued by the disconcerting affinities between simians and human beings, he first 
compared them in 1949 in Head IV (Man with a Monkey) (formerly Collection 
Geoffrey Gates, New York), in which a man's averted face is concealed by that of the 
monkey he holds. 

Like his human subjects, Bacon's animals are shown in formal portraits or candid 
snapshots in which they are passive, shrieking, or twisted in physical contortions. The 
chimpanzee in the Peggy Guggenheim work is depicted with relative benevolence, 
though the blurring of the image, reflecting Bacon's interest in frozen motion and the 
effects of photography and film, makes it difficult to interpret the pose or expression. In 
composition and treatment it is close to paintings of simians executed in the fifties by 
Graham Sutherland, with whom Bacon became friendly in 1946. The faint, schematic 
framing enabled Bacon to "see" the subject better, while the monochrome background 
provides a starkly contrasting field that helps to define form. (L. F.)

(Chataine aux hautes chairs) 

August 195 1 

Oil-based mixed-media on board, 64.9 x 54 cm 

76.2553 pg 121 



Jean Dubuffet was attracted to the surfaces of dilapidated walls, pitted roads, and 
the natural crusts of earth and rock, and during the 1940s and 1950s sought to 
create an equivalent texture in his art. He experimented with a variety of materials 
to produce thick, ruggedly tactile surfaces that constitute deliberately awkward, 
vulgar, and abbreviated imagery, often of grotesque faces or female nudes. Dubuffet 
made the present work with an oil-based "mortar," applying it with a palette knife, 
allowing areas to dry partially, then scraping, gouging, raking, slicing, or wiping 
them before applying more medium. The resulting surface is so thick that incisions 
providing the contours and delineating features seem to model form in relief. He 
wrote that this mortar enabled him to "provoke systems of relief in objects where 
reliefs are least expected, and lent itself, at the same time, to very realistic effects of 
rugged and stony terrains. I enjoyed the idea that a single medium should have this 
double (ambiguous) power: to accentuate the actual and familiar character of certain 
elements (notably in figurations of ground and soils), and yet to precipitate other 
elements into a world of fantasmagoric irreality."' 

Dubuffet's aggressively anticultural, antiaesthetic attitude and spontaneity of 
expression provided an example for members of the cobra group in Europe, and 
New York artists such as Claes Oldenburg and Jim Dine. (L. F.)

ASGER JORN 



Untitled 

1956-57 
Oil on canvas, 141 x 110.1 cm 

76.2553 pg 175 



From about 1948 Asger Jorn filled his canvases with swarming faces and figures, 
vaporous equivalents of the eccentric visages in crowd scenes by the Belgian artist 
James Ensor. Their scrawled half-innocent, half-demonic features also have antecedents 
in the creatures of Jean Dubuffet and Paul Klee. These presences hovering on the 
surface of the canvas are integrated with their surroundings, scarcely distinguishable as 
representational forms. In the present canvas blobs of paint and linear contours 
coalesce into a standing, grinning human figure at the right and a bird in the center; a 
multitude of faces, less acutely defined, emerge, vanish, and reappear in the seething 
environment. Wherever two dots can be interpreted as eyes, a face can be imagined. 

The sense of fantasy here is complemented by the candied color applied in 
thicknesses ranging from thin veneer to heavy ridges. Line incises its way through the 
fluffy space of this layered pigment to determine boundaries and suggest form. The dots 
of color sprinkled throughout anticipate the pointillism of the artist's Luxury Paintings 
of the early 1960s, in which paint is dripped onto the canvas from a perforated tin 
can. The accidental revelation of form and the importance of chance in Jorn's work 
suggest Surrealist concerns. (L. F.)

The Crying Crocodile Tries to Catch the Sun 

1956 

Oil on canvas, 145.5 x 113. 1 cm 

76.2553 pg 174 



Karel Appel, like Asger Jorn, was a member of the cobra group, which emphasized 
material and its spontaneous application. Although the group was short-lived, its 
concerns have endured in his work. The single standing figures of humans or animals 
he developed during the 1950s are rendered in a deliberately awkward, naive way, with 
no attempt at modeling or perspectival illusionism. Thus, the crocodile in this painting 
is presented as a flat and immobile form, contoured with heavy black lines in the 
manner of a child's drawing. 

Appel's paint handling activates a frenzy of rhythmic movement in The Crying 
Crocodile . . . despite the static monumentality of the subject. Drips and smears are 
interspersed with veritable stalactites of brilliant, unmodulated color that buckle, ooze, 
slash, wither, and thread their way over the surface. The physicality of the impasto and 
its topographic variety allow it to reflect light and cast shadows dramatically, increasing 
the emotional intensity of violent color contrasts. In 1956 Appel summarized the 
genesis of his work: "I never try to make a painting; it is a howl, it is naked, it is like a 
child, it is a caged tiger. . . . My tube is like a rocket writing its own space." 1 (L. F.)

EMILIO VEDOVA 



Image of Time (Barrier) 

(Immagine del tempo [Sbarramento 

1951 

Egg tempera on canvas, 130.5 x 170.4 cm 

76.2553 pg 162 



Emilio Vedova's work has antecedents in the long tradition of dynamic expression that 
has existed in Italian art since Tintoretto. Like the Futurists, Vedova sees his work as a 
response to contemporary social upheavals. Though he shares the emotional pitch of 
the Futurists, his political position is antithetical to theirs. While they romantically 
celebrated the aggressive energies of societal conflict, Vedova in his feverish, violent 
canvases conveys in abstract terms his horror and moral protestation in the face of 
man's assault on his own kind. 

Vedova expressed a political consciousness in his work for the first time during the 
late 1930s, when his works were inspired by the Spanish Civil War. His continuing 
commitment to social issues gave rise to series such as Cycle of Protest and Image of 
Time, initiated during the first years of the 1950s. Although the generating impulse of 
this turbulent painting is political, its formal preoccupations parallel those of the 
American Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and, above all, Franz Kline. The 
drama of the angular, graphic slashes of black on white is heightened with accents of 
orange-red. Occupying a shallow space, pictorial elements are locked together in formal 
combat and emotional turmoil. (L. F.)

GIUSEPPE SANTOMASO 



Secret Life 

(Vita segreta) 

1958 

Oil on canvas, 73.1 x 49.9 cm 

76.2553 pg 161 



In resolving the problems of representing color and light, Giuseppe Santomaso relies on 
the daily experience of his native Venice, fortified by knowledge of classical culture. His 
development of a non-objective mode of expression for his perceptions of nature was 
influenced by American abstract art, particularly after his visit in 1957 to New York, 
where he met Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, 
Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko. Santomaso uses nature as a "visual pretext" (to 
employ his own term), absorbing it and changing it into pictorial form; the resultant 
painting derives its impact not from the imitation of nature, but from the tension 
between art and nature. Life can be imparted to abstract form only through its 
disposition in an "abstract order." Santomaso refers to the eye's exploratory adventure 
as it perceives the "secret combination" of things in nature and their "fantastic 
equivalent" in painting. 1 The title of this work alludes to the encounter of life and art, 
and draws attention to the hint of a centralized human figure, the structural features of 
which appear and disappear, easily mistaken for the random patterns seen on a peeling 
Venetian wall. The romantic colors — rose, gray, smoky blue, warm browns, and 
ochers — evoke gentle nostalgia. (L.F.)

Oil with sand on canvas, 140.2 x 140 cm 
76.2553 pg 164 



Edmondo Bacci has applied the physicality of action painting to the depiction of the 
origins of matter in extraterrestrial regions. Like the apocalyptic paintings of the years 
immediately preceding World War I by artists such as Vasily Kandinsky and Franz 
Marc, his work comingles themes of cosmic genesis and destruction expressed through 
swirling atmospheric color. The three primaries, red, blue, and yellow, predominate, 
defining broad areas against which a wide range of other colors play. The painting is 
like a scenario in which light is separated from darkness and space from matter. 
Planetary forms seem to coalesce out of material produced by a cosmic eruption; they 
prepare to establish their orbits and generate life. The immediacy and drama of the 
event is conveyed through the tactility of the surface. The paint, mixed with sand, is 
encrusted on the canvas to form a kind of topographic ground evoking plains, ridges, 
lakes, and peaks. The activity of the artist in ordering chaos is associated with 
elemental creational processes within the universe. (L.F.)

TANCREDI 



Composition 
(Composizione) 

1955 

Oil and tempera on canvas, 129.5 x J 95 cm 

76.2553 pg 166 



Where Piet Mondrian used the square as a unit with which to express a notion of space 
and infinity, Tancredi, who saw his aims as parallel to those of Mondrian, seized on the 
point as his module. He was intrigued by the point's identity as the determinant sign of 
location, the smallest indication of presence. Tancredi's ideas about infinite space and 
the use of the point within it were developed by 195 1, when he settled in Venice. This 
work typifies the crowded, architectonic compositions he painted before his visit to 
Paris in 1955. 

Incomplete circles vibrant with undiluted pigment radiate from pivotal points and 
swirl throughout the canvas. These appear below, above, and amid rectangular slabs, 
the whole comprising a multilayered scaffolding of light and color producing the 
illusion of extensive, textured depth. Density of form and color increases toward the 
center of the composition, which consequently appears to bulge forward from the 
corners, illustrating Tancredi's view of space as curved. The vitality of execution and 
tactile richness reflect the influence of Jackson Pollock. The choppy, animated repetition 
of color applied with a palette knife resembles that of the French-Canadian painter 
Jean-Paul Riopelle, with whom Tancredi exhibited in 1954. (L. F.)

Sphere No. 4 

(Sfera n. 4) 

1963-64 (cast 1964) 

Bronze, 185 cm circumference 

76.2553 pg 214 



Although the figurative tradition represented by Marino Marini and Giacomo Manzu 
has flourished in postwar Italian sculpture, an equally energetic commitment to 
abstraction has been pursued by artists such as Pietro Consagra, Mirko, and the 
Pomodoro brothers, Gio and Arnaldo. Trained in goldsmithing, Arnaldo Pomodoro 
combines the meticulous approach and skill of the craftsman with the techniques and 
aims of the caster of large-scale bronzes. His sculpture, cast from plasters of clay 
originals, contrasts the intricate detailing of jewelry with geometric breadth and clarity. 

Using the basic shapes of cube, cylinder, and sphere, he tears open their pristine, 
highly polished surfaces to reveal the internal structure of form. Underneath the 
gleaming skin and solid flesh of the bronze lies a regulating machinery of cogs and 
gears, which Pomodoro calls "sign systems," akin to the complex interlocking systems 
of language or of organic bodies. The sphere not only functions as a geometric shape 
and analogue of a living body or mineral form, but also suggests the globe of the earth. 
The equatorial rupture produces configurations suggesting land masses, and evokes the 
earth's core and desiccated ocean beds. By eliminating frontality, Pomodoro invites the 
viewer to circle the globe, conveying a sense of uninterrupted rotational movement 
imitating the orbit of planets. (L. F.) 



PLATE 96 



MARINO MARINI 



The Angel of the City 

(L'angelo della citta) 

1948 (cast 1950?) 

Bronze, 247.9 x 106 cm, including base 

76.2553 pg 183 



Marino Marini drew on the tradition of Etruscan and Northern European sculpture in 
developing his themes of the female nude, the portrait bust, and the equestrian figure. 
By interpreting classical themes in light of modern concerns and with modern 
techniques, he sought to contribute a mythic image that would be applicable in a 
contemporary context. 

The evolution of the subject of the horse and rider reflects Marini's personal 
response to that changing context. The theme first appears in his work in 1936, when 
the proportions of horse and rider are relatively slender and both figures are poised, 
formal, and calm. By the following year the horse rears and the rider gestures. In 1940 
the forms become simplified and more archaic in spirit, and the proportions become 
squatter. By the late 1940s the horse is planted immobile with its neck extended, 
strained, ears pinned back, and mouth open, as in the present example, which conveys 
the qualities characteristic of this period of Marini's work — affirmation and charged 
strength associated explicitly with sexual potency. Later, the rider becomes increasingly 
oblivious of his mount, involved in his own visions or anxieties. Eventually he was 
to topple from the horse as it fell to the ground in an apocalyptic image of lost 
control, paralleling Marini's feelings of despair and uncertainty about the future of the 
world. (L.F.) 



KAREL APPEL 

b. 1921 

Karel Appel was born on April 25, 
1921, in Amsterdam. From 1940 
to 1943 he studied at the 
Rijksakademie van Beeldende 
Kunsten in Amsterdam. In 1946 
his first solo show was held at Het 
Beerenhuis in Groningen, the 
Netherlands, and he participated 
in the Jonge Scbilders exhibition 
at the Stedelijk Museum of 
Amsterdam. About this time 
Appel was influenced first by 
Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, 
then by Jean Dubuffet. He was a 
member of the Nederlandse 
Experimentele Groep and 
established the cobra movement 
in 1948 with Constant, Corneille, 
and others. In 1949 Appel 
completed a fresco for the 
cafeteria of the city hall in 
Amsterdam, which created such 
controversy that it was covered 
for ten years. 

In 1950 the artist moved to 
Paris; there the writer Hugo Claus 
introduced him to Michel Tapie, 
who organized various exhibitions 
of his work. Appel was given a 
solo show at the Palais des Beaux- 
Arts in Brussels in 1953. He 
received the unesco Prize at the 
Venice Biennale of 1954, and was 
commissioned to execute a mural 
for the restaurant of the Stedelijk 
Museum in 1956. The following 
year Appel traveled to Mexico 
and the United States and won a 
graphics prize at the Ljubljana 
Biennial in Yugoslavia. He was 
awarded an International Prize for 
Painting at the Sao Paulo Bienal in 
1959. The first major monograph 
on Appel, written by Claus, was 
published in 1962. In the late 
1960s the artist moved to the 
Chateau de Molesmes, near 
Auxerre, southeast of Paris. Solo 
exhibitions of his work were held 
at the Centre National d'Art 
( lontemporain in Paris and the 
Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam 
in 1 968, and at the Kunsthalle 
Basel and the Palais des Beaux- 
Arts in Brussels in 1969. During 
the 1950s and 1960s he executed 
numerous murals for public 
buildings. A major Appel show 
opened at the Centraal Museum 
m l ftrecht m 19-0, ami .1 
retrospective of his work toured 
( lanada and the United Stales m 



1972. Appel lives in New York 
and outside Florence. 



ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO 

1887-1964 

Alexander Archipenko was born 
on May 30, 1887, in Kiev, 
Ukraine, Russia. In 1902 he 
entered the Kiev Art School, 
where he studied painting and 
sculpture until 1905. During this 
time he was impressed by the 
Byzantine icons, frescoes, and 
mosaics of Kiev. After a sojourn in 
Moscow Archipenko moved to 
Paris in 1908. He attended the 
Ecole des Beaux-Arts for a brief 
period and then continued to 
study independently at the 
Louvre, where he was drawn to 
Egyptian, Assyrian, archaic 
Greek, and early Gothic sculpture. 
In 1 910 he began exhibiting at the 
Salon des Independants, Paris, 
and the following year showed for 
the first time at the Salon 
d'Automne. 

In 19 1 2 Archipenko was given 
his first solo show in Germany at 
the Folkwang Museum in Hagen. 
That same year in Paris he opened 
the first of his many art schools, 
joined the Section d'Or group, 
which included Georges Braque, 
Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger, 
and Pablo Picasso, among others, 
and produced his first painted 
reliefs, the Sculpto-Peintures. In 
19 1 3 Archipenko exhibited at the 
Armory Show in New York and 
made his first prints, which were 
reproduced in the Italian Futurist 
publication Lacerba in 1914. He 
participated in the Salon des 
Independants in 19 14 and the 
Venice Biennale in 1920. During 
the war years the artist resided in 
Cimiez, a suburb of Nice. From 
19 1 9 to 192 1 he traveled to 
Geneva, Zurich, Paris, London, 
Brussels, Athens, and other 
European cities to exhibit his 
work. Archipenko's first solo 
show in the United States was 
held at the Societe Anonyme in 
New York in 192 1. 

In 1923 he moved from Berlin 
to the United States where, over 
the years, he opened art schools in 
New York City, Woodstock (New 
York), Los Angeles, and Chicago. 
In 1914 Archipenko invented his 
first kinetic work, Archipentura. 



For the next thirty years he taught 
throughout the United States at 
art schools and universities, 
including the New Bauhaus 
School of Industrial Arts in 
Chicago. He became a United 
States citizen in 1928. Most of 
Archipenko's work in German 
museums was confiscated by the 
Nazis in their purge of 
"degenerate art." In 1947 he 
produced the first of his sculptures 
that are illuminated from within. 
He accompanied an exhibition of 
his work throughout Germany in 
1955, and at this time began his 
book Archipenko: Fifty Creative 
Years 1908-1958, published in 
i960. Archipenko died on 
February 25, 1964, in New York. 



JEAN ARP 

1 886-1966 

Jean (Hans) Arp was born on 
September 16, 1886, in 
Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine. In 
1904, after leaving the Ecole des 
Arts et Metiers in Strasbourg, he 
visited Paris and published his 
poetry for the first time. From 
1905 to 1907 Arp studied at the 
Kunstschule of Weimar and in 

1908 went to Paris, where he 
attended the Academie Julian. In 

1909 he moved to Switzerland 
and in 19 11 was a founder of the 
Moderner Bund group there. The 
following year he met Robert and 
Sonia Delaunay in Paris and 
Vasily Kandinsky in Munich. Arp 
participated in the Erste deutsche 
Herbstsalon in 19 13 at Der Sturm 
gallery in Berlin. After returning 
to Paris in 19 14, he became 
acquainted with Guillaume 
Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and 
Pablo Picasso. In 191 5 he moved 
to Zurich, where he executed 
collages and tapestries, often in 
collaboration with his future wife, 
Sophie Taeuber. 

In 1 9 16 Hugo Ball opened the 
Cabaret Voltaire, which was to 
become the center of Dada 
activities in Zurich, for a group 
including Arp, Marcel Janco, 
Tristan Tzara, and others. Arp 
continued his involvement with 
Dada after moving to Cologne in 
1919- In 1922. he participated in 
the Kongress der Konstruktivisten 
m Weimar. Soon thereafter he 
began contributing to magazines 



216 



such as Merz, Mecano, De Stijl, 
and in 192 s ha Revolution 
surrealiste. Arp's work appeared 
in the first exhibition of the 
Surrealist group at the Galerie 
Pierre in Paris in 1925. In 1926 he 
settled in Meudon, France. 

In 193 1 Arp was associated 
with the Paris-based group 
Abstraction-Creation and the 
periodical Transition. Throughout 
the 1930s and until the end of his 
life he continued to write and 
publish poetry and essays. In 
1942 he fled Meudon for Zurich; 
he was to make Meudon his 
primary residence again in 1946. 
The artist visited New York in 
1949 on the occasion of his solo 
show at Curt Valentin's Buchholz 
Gallery. In 1950 he was invited to 
execute a relief for the Harvard 
Graduate Center in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. In 1954 Arp 
received the International Prize 
for Sculpture at the Venice 
Biennale. A large retrospective of 
his work was held at the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York in 
1958, followed by another at the 
Musee National d'Art Moderne in 
Paris in 1962. Arp died on June 7, 
1966, in Basel. 



EDMONDO BACCI 

191 t-i9 _ 8 

Edmondo Bacci was born on 
July 21, 19 1 3, in Venice. He 
studied with Ettore Tito and 
Virgilio Guidi at the Accademia di 
Belle Arti of Venice from 1932 to 
1937. His first solo exhibition was 
held at the Galleria del Cavallino 
in Venice in 1945. ' n T 948 he 
participated in the Venice Biennale 
for the first of many times. Bacci 
was included in the first Genoa 
Biennale in 195 1 and in an 
exhibition of the Movimento 
Spaziale, the group founded by 
Lucio Fontana, held in Venice in 
1953. He contributed regularly to 
Spazialismo exhibitions thereafter, 
among them Espacialismo at the 
Galeria Bonino in Buenos Aires in 
1966. From the mid-1950s Bacci 
received support from Peggy 
Guggenheim. 

An important solo exhibition 
of Bacci's work took place at the 
Galleria del Cavallino in 1955. 
His first solo show in the United 
States occurred at the Seventv- 



Five Gallery in New York the 
following year. Solo exhibitions of 
his work were held also at the 
Galleria del Naviglio, Milan, the 
Galleria d'Arte Selecta, Rome, 
and the Galleria "La Cittadella" 
in Ascona, Switzerland, all in 
1957. That same year he 
participated in Between Space and 
Earth at the Marlborough Gallery 
in London. Bacci was accorded a 
separate room at the Venice 
Biennale of 1958, and he received 
a Prize of the Municipality of 
Venice at the Terza biennale 
dell'incisione itaiiana 
contemporanea in Venice in 1959. 
He was given shows at the Drian 
Gallery in London in 1961 and at 
the Frank Perls Gallery in Beverly 
Hills the following year. In 1961 
he also participated in Neue 
italienische Kunst at Galerie 59 in 
Aschaffenburg. He executed 
lithographs to accompany a 
poem by Guido Ballo, // cie-lo 
Kainos, in 1972. Bacci died on 
October 16, 1978, in Venice. 



FRANCIS BACON 

1 909- 1 992 

Francis Bacon was born in Dublin 
on October 28, 1909. At the age 
of sixteen he moved to London 
and subsequently lived for about 
two years in Berlin and Paris. 
Although Bacon never attended 
art school he began to draw and 
work in watercolor about 
1926-27. Pablo Picasso's work 
decisively influenced his painting 
until the mid-i940s. Upon his 
return to London in 1929 he 
established himself as a furniture 
designer and interior designer. He 
began to use oils in the fall of that 
year and exhibited furniture and 
rugs as well as a few paintings in 
his studio. His work was included 
in a group exhibition in London 
at the Mayor Gallery in 1933. In 
1 934 the artist organized his own 
first solo show at Sunderland 
House, London, which he called 
Transition Gallery for the 
occasion. He participated in a 
group show at Thos. Agnew and 
Sons in London in 1 9 3 "^ - 

Bacon painted relatively little 
after his solo show and in the 
1930s and early 1940s destroyed 
many of his works. He began to 
paint intensively again in 1944. 



His first major solo show- took 
place at the Hanover Gallery m 
I ondon in 1949. From the mid- 
1940s to the 1950s Bacon's work 
reflected the influence of 
Surrealism. In the 1950s Bacon 
drew on such sources as 
Yela/quez's Portrait of Pope 
Innocent X, Vincent van Gogh's 
The Painter on the Road to 
Tarascon, and Eadweard 
Muyhridge's photographs. His 
first solo exhibition outside 
England was held in 1953 at the 
Durlacher Brothers, New York. In 
1950-51 and 1952 the artist 
traveled to South Africa. He 
visited Italy in 1954 when his 
work was featured in the British 
Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. 
His first retrospective was held at 
the Institute of Contemporary 
Art, London, in 1955. Bacon was 
given a solo show at the Sao 
Paulo Bienal in 1959. In 1962 the 
Tate Gallery, London, organized a 
major Bacon retrospective, a 
modified version of which 
traveled to Mannheim, Turin, 
Zurich, and Amsterdam. Other 
important exhibitions of his work 
were held at the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum, New York, 
in 1963 and the Grand Palais in 
Paris in 1971; paintings from 
1968 to 1974 were exhibited at 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
New York, in 1975. The artist 
died in Madrid on April 28, 1992. 



GIACOMO BALLA 

1871-1958 

Giacomo Balla was born in Turin 
on July 18, 1 8- 1. In 1891 he 
studied briefly at the Accademia 
Albertina di Belle Arti and the 
Liceo Artistico in Turin and 
exhibited for the first time under 
the aegis of the Societa Promotrice 
di Belle Arti in that city. He 
studied at the University of Turin 
with Cesare Lombroso about 
1892. In 1895 Balla moved to 
Rome, where he worked for 
several years as an illustrator, 
caricaturist, and portrait painter. 
In [899 his work was included in 
the Venice Biennale and in the 
Esposizione internazionale di belle 
arti at the galleries of the Societa 
degli Amatori e Cultori di Belle 
Arti in Rome, where he exhibited 
regularly for the next ten years. In 



217 



1900 Balla spent seven months in 
Paris assisting the illustrator 
Serafino Macchiati. About 1903 
he began to instruct Gino Severini 
and Umberto Boccioni in 
divisionist painting techniques. In 
1903 his work was exhibited at 
the Esposizione internazionale 
d'arte della citta di Venezia and in 
1903 and 1904 at the Glaspalast 
in Munich. In 1904 Balla was 
represented in the Internationale 
Kunstausstellung in Diisseldorf, 
and in 1909 exhibited at the Salon 
d'Automne in Paris. 

Balla signed the second Futurist 
painting manifesto of 1910 with 
Boccioni, Carlo Carra, Luigi 
Russolo, and Severini, although he 
did not exhibit with the group 
until 1913. In 1 9 1 2 he traveled to 
London and to Diisseldorf, where 
he began painting his abstract 
light studies. In 1913 Balla 
participated in the Erste deutsche 
Herbstsalon at Der Sturm gallery 
in Berlin and in an exhibition at 
the Rotterdamsche Kunstkring in 
Rotterdam. In 19 14 he 
experimented with sculpture for 
the first time and showed it in the 
Prima esposizione libera futurist a 
at the Galleria Sprovieri, Rome. 
He also designed and painted 
Futurist furniture and designed 
Futurist "antineutral" clothing. 
With Fortunato Depero, Balla 
wrote the manifesto Ricostruzione 
futurista dell'universo in 191 5. His 
first solo exhibitions were held 
that same year at the Societa 
Italiana Lampade Elettriche "Z" 
and at the Sala d'Arte A. Angelelli 
in Rome. His work was also 
shown in 191 5 at the Panama- 
Pacific International Exposition in 
San Francisco. In 1918 he was 
given a solo show at the Casa 
d'Arte Bragaglia in Rome. Balla 
continued to exhibit in Europe 
and the United States and in 1 9 j 5 
was made a member of the 
Accademia di San Luca in Rome. 
I [e died on March 1, 195X, 
in Rome. 



WILLIAM BAZIOTES 

[912-1963 

William Baziotes was born to 
parents oi Greek origin on 
fune 11, 19 1 2, in Pittsburgh. I Ie 
grew up in Reading, Pennsylvania, 
where he worked ai the ( ase 



Glass company from 193 1 to 
1933, antiquing glass and running 
errands. At this time he took 
evening sketch classes and met the 
poet Byron Vazakas, who became 
his life-long friend. Vazakas 
introduced Baziotes to the work 
of Charles Baudelaire and the 
Symbolist poets. In 193 1 Baziotes 
saw the Henri Matisse exhibition 
at the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York, and in 1933 he moved 
to that city to study painting. 
From 1933 to 1936 Baziotes 
attended the National Academy 
of Design. 

In 1936 he exhibited for the 
first time in a group show at the 
Municipal Art Gallery, New York, 
and was employed by the WPA 
Federal Art Project as an art 
teacher at the Queens Museum. 
Baziotes worked in the easel 
division of the WPA from 1938 to 
1 94 1. He met the Surrealist 
emigres in New York in the late 
thirties and early forties, and by 
1940 knew Jimmy Ernst, Matta, 
and Gordon Onslow-Ford. He 
began to experiment with 
Surrealist automatism at this time. 
In 1 94 1 Matta introduced 
Baziotes to Robert Motherwell, 
with whom he formed a close 
friendship. Andre Masson invited 
Baziotes to participate with 
Motherwell, David Hare, and 
others in the 1942 exhibition First 
Papers of Surrealism at the 
Whitelaw Reid Mansion in New 
York. In 1943 he took part in two 
group shows at Peggy 
Guggenheim's Art of This

UMBERTO BOCCIONI 

1 882-19 1 6 

Umberto Boccioni was born on 
October 19, 1882, in Reggio 
Calabria, Italy. In 1901 he went to 
Rome, where he studied design 
with a sign painter and attended 
the Scuola Libera del Nudo at the 
Accademia di Belle Arti. In Rome 
he and Gino Severini learned the 
techniques of divisionist painting 
from Giacomo Balla. Boccioni 
traveled in 1902 to Paris, where he 
studied Impressionist and Post- 
Impressionist painting. He 
participated in the Mostra dei 
rifiutati in 1905 and in the 
Esposizione di belle arti in 1906, 
both in Rome. 

Following a trip to Russia in 
1906, Boccioni visited Padua and 
then moved to Venice, where he 
spent the winter of 1 906-07 
taking life- drawing classes at the 
Accademia di Belle Arti. In 1907 
he settled in Milan. In 1909-10 
Boccioni began to frequent the 
Famiglia Artistica, a Milanese 
artists' society that sponsored 
annual exhibitions. During this 
period he associated with Carlo 
Carra and Luigi Russolo, and met 
the poet Filippo Tommaso 
Marinetti, who had published the 
first Futurist manifesto in 
February of 1909. In 19 10 
Boccioni participated in the 
formulation of the two Futurist 
manifestos Manifesto dei pittori 
futurist! and Manifesto tecmco 
della pittura futurista. He, Carra, 
Russolo, and Severini signed the 
first, and were joined by Balla in 
signing the second. That same 
year Boccioni's first solo 
exhibition was held at the Galleria 
Ca' Pesaro in Venice. 

In the fall of 191 1 the artist 
went to Paris, where he met Pablo 
Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire 
through Severini. Boccioni's 
paintings were shown with those 
of Carra, Russolo, and Severini in 
the first Futurist show in Paris, at 
the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in 
19 12. The exhibition then 
traveled to London, Berlin, and 
Brussels. In 19 12 Boccioni began 
concentrating on sculpture, and 
his Manifesto tecmco della 
scitltura futurista was published, 
from 1 9 1 2 to 1 9 1 4 he 
contributed articles to the Futurist 
publication l.acerha. In 1913 the 



218 



artist showed sculpture and 
paintings in a solo show at the 
Galerie de la Boetie in Paris, and 
his sculpture was included in the 
inaugural exhibition of the 
Galleria Futurista Permanente in 
Rome. His book Pittura e scultura 
futuriste (dinamismo plastico) 
appeared in 19 14. In July of [915 
Boccioni enlisted in the army 
with Marinetti, Russolo, and 
Antonio Sant'Elia. He suffered an 
accident during cavalry exercises 
in Sorte near Verona, and died on 
August it, 1 91 6. 



CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI 
1876-1957 

Constantin Brancusi was born on 
February 19, 1876, in the village 
of Hobitza, Romania. He studied 
art at the Craiova School of Arts 
and Crafts from 1894 to 1898 
and at the Bucharest School of 
Fine Arts from 1898 to 1901. 
Eager to continue his education in 
Paris, Brancusi arrived there in 
1904 and enrolled in the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts in 1905. The 
following year his sculpture was 
shown at the Salon d'Automne. 
where he met Auguste Rodin. 
Soon after 1907 his mature 
period began. The sculptor had 
settled in Paris but throughout 
these years returned frequently to 
Bucharest and exhibited there 
almost every year. In Paris his 
friends included Marcel 
Duchamp, Fernand Leger, Henri 
Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, and 
Henri Rousseau. In 19 13 five of 
Brancusi's sculptures were 
included in the Armory Show in 
New York. Alfred Stieglitz 
presented the first solo show of 
Brancusi's work at his gallery 
"291" in New York in 19 14. 
Brancusi was never a member of 
any organized artistic movement, 
although he associated with 
Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara. 
and many other Dadaists in the 
early 1920s. In 1921 he was 
honored with a special issue of 
The Little Review. He traveled to 
the United States twice in 1926 to 
attend his solo shows at 
Wildenstein and at the Brummer 
Gallery in New York. The 
following year a major trial was 
initiated in U.S. Customs Court to 
determine whether Brancusi's Bird 



111 Space was liable tor duty as a 
manufactured object or as a work 
of art. The court decided in 
1928 that the sculpture was a 
work of art. 

Brancusi traveled extensively in 
the 1930s, visiting India and 
Egypt as well as European 
countries. He was commissioned 
to create a war memorial tor a 
park in Turgu Jiu, Romania, in 
1935, and designed a complex 
that included gates, tables, stools, 
and an Endless Column. 
In 1937 Brancusi discussed a 
proposed Temple of Meditation in 
India with the Maharajah of 
Indore (who had purchased 
several of his sculptures l. but the 
project was never realized. After 
1939 Brancusi worked alone in 
Paris. His last sculpture, a plaster 
Grand Coq, was completed in 
1949. In 1952 Brancusi became a 
French citizen. He died in Paris on 
March 16, 195-. 



GEORGES BRAQUE 

1 882-1963 

Georges Braque was born in 
Argenteuil-sur-Seine on Max 1 ;. 
1882. He grew? up in Le Havre 
and studied evenings at the 
Ecole des Beaux-Arts there from 
about 1897 to 1899. He left for 
Paris to study under a master- 
decorator to receive his 
craftsman certificate in 1901. 
From 1902 to 1904 he painted 
at the Academie Humbert in 
Pans, where he met Marie 
Laurencin and Francis Picabia. By 
1906 Braque's work was no 
longer Impressionist but Fauve in 
style; after spending that summer 
in Antwerp with Othon Friesz, he 
showed his Fauve work the 
following year in the Salon des 
Independants in Paris. His first 
solo show was at D.-H. 
Kahnweiler's gallery in 1908. 
From 1909 Pablo Picasso and 
Braque worked together in 
developing Cubism; by 191 1 their 
styles were extremely similar. In 
191 2 they started to incorporate 
collage elements into their 
paintings and to experiment with 
the papier colle (pasted paper) 
technique. Their artistic 
collaboration lasted until 19 14. 
Braque was wounded during 
World War I; upon his recovery in 



1 4 1 - he began a close friendship 
with fuan Gris. 

After World War 1 his work 
became freer and less schematic. 
His fame grew in 1922 as a result 
of a major exhibition at the Salon 
d'Automne 111 Paris. In the mid- 
1920s Braque designed the decor 
for two Sergei Diaghilev ballets. 
By the end of the decade he had 
returned to a more realistic- 
interpretation of nature, although 
certain aspects of Cubism always 
remained present in his work. In 
193 1 Braque made his first 
engraved plasters and began to 
portray mythological subjects. His 
first important retrospective took 
place in 1933 at the Kunsthalle 
Basel. He won First Prize at the 
Carnegie International in 
Pittsburgh in 1937. 

During World War II Braque 
remained in Paris. His paintings at 
that time, primarily still lifes and 
interiors, became more somber. In 
addition to paintings, Braque also 
made lithographs, engravings, and 
sculpture. From the late 1940s 
Braque treated various recurring 
themes such as birds, ateliers, 
landscapes, and seascapes. In 
1953 he designed stained-glass 
windows for the church of 
Varengeville. During the last tew 
years of his life Braque's ill health 
prevented him from undertaking 
further large-scale commissions 
but he continued to paint and 
make lithographs and jewelry 
designs. He died in Paris on 
August 31, 1963. 



VICTOR BRAUNER 

I 903-1966 

Victor Brauner was born on 
June 15, 1903, in Piatra-Neamt, 
Romania. His father was involved 
in spiritualism and sent Brauner to 
evangelical school in Braila from 
19 16 to 19 1 8. In 1 92 1 he briefly 
attended the School of Fine Arts in 
Bucharest, where he painted 
C ezannesque landscapes. He 
exhibited paintings in his 
subsequent expressionist style at 
his first solo show at the Galerie 
Mozart in Bucharest in 1924. 
Brauner helped found the 
Dadaist review 75 ///' in 
Bucharest. He went to Paris in 
192s but returned to Bucharest 
approximately a year later. In 



119 



Bucharest in 1929 Brauner was 
associated with the Dadist and 
Surrealist review UNU. 

Brauner settled in Paris in 
1930 and became a friend of his 
compatriot Constantin Brancusi. 
Then he met Yves Tanguy, who 
introduced him to the Surrealists 
by 1953- Andre Breton wrote an 
enthusiastic introduction to the 
catalogue tor Brauner's first 
Parisian solo show at the Galerie 
Pierre in 1934. The exhibition 
was not well-received, and in 
1935 Brauner returned to 
Bucharest, where he remained 
until 1938. That year he moved to 
Paris, lived briefly with Tanguy, 
and painted a number of works 
featuring distorted human figures 
with mutilated eyes. Some of these 
paintings, dated as early as 193 1, 
proved gruesomely prophetic 
when he lost his own eye in a 
scuffle in 1938. At the outset of 
World War II Brauner fled to the 
South of France, where he 
maintained contact with other 
Surrealists in Marseille. Later he 
sought refuge in Switzerland; 
unable to obtain suitable 
materials there, he improvised an 
encaustic from candle wax and 
developed a graffito technique. 

Brauner returned to Paris in 
1945. He was included in the 
Exposition Internationale dn 
surrealisme at the Galerie Maeght 
in Paris in 1947. His postwar 
painting incorporated forms and 
symbols based on Tarot cards, 
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and 
antique Mexican codices. In the 
fifties Brauner traveled to 
Normandy and Italy, and his 
work was shown at the Venice 
Biennale in 1954 and in 1966. He 
died in Paris on March 12, 1966. 



ALEXANDER CALDER 

1 898-1976 

Alexander Calder was born on 
July 22, [898, in I.awnton, 
Pennsylvania, into a family of 
artists. In 19 19 he received an 
engineering degree from Stevens 
Institute of Technology in 
I [oboken, New Jersey. Calder 
attended the Art Students League 
in New York from 1923 to 1926, 
studying briefly with Thomas 
I [art Benton and John Sloan, 
among others. As ,1 freelance 



artist for the National Police 
Gazette in 1925 he spent two 
weeks sketching at the circus; his 
fascination with the subject dates 
from this time. He also made his 
first sculpture in 1925; the 
following year he made several 
constructions of animals and 
figures with wire and wood. 
Calder's first exhibition of 
paintings took place in 1926 at 
the Artist's Gallery in New York. 
Later that year he went to Paris 
and attended the Academie de la 
Grande Chaumiere. In Paris he 
met Stanley William Hayter, 
exhibited at the 1926 Salon des 
Independants and in 1927 began 
giving performances of his 
miniature circus. The first show of 
his wire animals and caricature 
portraits was held at the Weyhe 
Gallery, New York, in 1928. That 
same year he met Joan Miro, who 
became his lifelong friend. 
Subsequently Calder divided his 
time between France and the 
United States. In 1929 the Galerie 
Billiet gave him his first solo show 
in Paris. He met Fernand Leger, 
Frederick Kiesler, and Theo van 
Doesburg and visited Mondrian's 
studio in 1930. Calder began to 
experiment with abstract 
sculpture at this time and in 193 1 
and 1932 introduced moving 
parts into his work. These moving 
sculptures were called mobiles; 
the stationary constructions were 
to be named stabiles. He exhibited 
with the Abstraction-Creation 
group in Paris in 1933- m J 943 
the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York gave him a major solo 
exhibition. 

During the 1950s Calder 
traveled widely and executed 
Towers (wall mobiles) and Gongs 
(sound mobiles). He won First 
Prize for Sculpture at the 1952 
Venice Biennale. Late in the 
decade the artist worked 
extensively with gouache; from 
this period he executed numerous 
major public commissions. In 
1964-65 the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum presented a 
major Calder retrospective. He 
began the Totems and the 
Animobiles, variations on the 
standing mobile, in 1966 and 
1971, respectively. An important 
Calder exhibition was held at the 
Whitney Museum of American 
Art in New York 111 [976. 



Calder died in New York on 
November 1 1, 1976.

during the war, settling in Vitebsk, 
where he was appointed 
Commissar for Art. He founded 
the Vitebsk Popular Art School 
and directed it until disagreements 
with the Suprematists resulted in 
his resignation in 1920. He moved 
to Moscow and executed his first 
stage designs for the State Jewish 
Chamber Theater there. After a 
sojourn in Berlin Chagall returned 
to Paris in 1923 and met

retrospective took place in 1924 
at the Galerie Barbazanges- 
Hodebert, Paris. During the 1930s 
he traveled to Palestine, the 
Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and 
Italy. In 1933 the Kunsthalle

JOSEPH CORNELL 

1903-1972 

Joseph Cornell was born on 
December 24, 1903, in Nyack, 
New York. From 19 17 to 1921 he 
attended Phillips Academy in 
Andover, Massachusetts. He was 
an avid collector of memorabilia 
and, while working as a woolen- 
goods salesman in New York for 
the next ten years, developed 
his interest in ballet, literature, 
and opera. 

In the early thirties Cornell met 
Surrealist writers and artists at the 
Julien Levy Gallery in New York 
and saw Max Ernst's collage- 
novel La Femme 100 tetes. 
Cornell's early constructions of 
found objects were first exhibited 
m Surrealism, presented at the 
Wadsworth Atheneum in 
Hartford and subsequently at 
Julien Levy's gallery in 19^2. 
From 1934 to 1940 Cornell 
supported himself by working at 
the Traphagen studio in New

became familiar with Marcel 
Duchamp's readymades and Kurt 
Schwitters's box constructions. 
Cornell was included in the 1936 
exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, 
Surrealism at the Museum of 
Modern Art, New York. Always 
interested in film and cinematic 
techniques, he made a number of 
movies, including Rose Hobart of

scenarios. One of these, Monsieur 
Phot of 193 1, was published in 
1936 in Levy's book Surrealism. 

Cornell's first solo exhibition 
took place at the Julien Levy 
Gallery in 1939 and included an 
array of objects, a number of 
them in shadow boxes. During the 
forties and fifties he made Medici 
boxes, boxes devoted to stage and 
screen personalities, Aviary 
constructions, Observatories, 
Nigbt Skies, Winter Nigbt Skies,

1960s Cornell stopped making 
new boxes and began to 
reconstruct old ones and to work 
intensively in collage. Major 
Cornell retrospectives were held 
in 1967 at the Pasadena Art 



Museum and the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum, New York. 
In 19-1 the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York

Italian parents in Volos, Greece, 
on July 10, 1888. In 1900 he 
began studies at the Athens 
Polytechnic Institute and attended 
evening classes in drawing from 
the nude. About 1906 he moved 
to Munich, where he attended the 
Akademie der Bildenden Kunste. 
At this time he became interested 
in the art of Arnold Bocklin and 
Max Klinger and the writings of 
Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur 
Schopenhauer. De Chirico moved 
to Milan in 1909, to Florence in

1913 and 1914. As a frequent 
visitor to Guillaume Apollinaire's 
weekly gatherings, he met 
Constantin Brancusi, Andre 
Derain, Max Jacob, and others. 
Because of the war, in 191 5 de 
Chirico returned to Italy, where he 
met Filippo de Pisis in 1916 and 
Carlo Carra in 191 7; they formed 
the group that was later called the 
Scuola Metafisica. 

The artist moved to Rome in 
191 8, and was given his first solo 
exhibition at the Casa d'Arte 
Bragaglia in that city in the winter 
of [918—19. In this period he was 
one of the leaders of the Gruppo 
Valori Plastici, with whom he 
showed at the Nationalgalerie in 
Berlin. From 1920 to 1924 he 
divided his time between Rome 
and Florence. A solo exhibition of 
de Chirico's work was held at the 
Galleria Arte in Milan in 1921. 
and he participated in the Venice 
Biennale for the first time in 1 924.

WILLEM DE KOONING 

b. 1904 

Willem de Kooning was born on 
April 24, 1904, in Rotterdam. 
From 1916 to 1925 he studied at 
night at the Academie voor 
Beeldende Kunsten en Technische 
Wetenschappen, Rotterdam, while 
apprenticed to a commercial art 
and decorating firm and later 
working for an art director. In 
1924 he visited museums in 
Belgium and studied further in 
Brussels and Antwerp. De Kooning 
came to the United States in 1926 
and settled briefly in Hoboken, 
New Jersey. He worked as a house 
painter before moving to New 
York in 1927, where he met Stuart 
Davis, Arshile Gorky, and John 
Graham. He took various 
commercial art and odd jobs until 
1935-36, when he was employed 
in the mural and easel divisions of 
the WPA Federal Art Project. 
Thereafter he painted full-time. In 
the late 1930s his abstract as well 
as figurative work was primarily 
influenced by the Cubism and 
Surrealism of Pablo Picasso and 
also by Gorky, with whom he 
shared a studio. 

In 1938 de Kooning started his 
first scries of Women, which 
would become a major recurrent 
theme. During the 1940s he 
participated in group shows with 
other artists who would form the 



New York School of Abstract 
Expressionism. De Kooning's first 
solo show, which took place at the 
Egan Gallery in New York in 
1948, established his reputation as 
a major artist; it included a 
number of the allover black-and- 
white abstractions he had initiated 
in 1946- The Women of the early 
1950s were followed by abstract 
urban landscapes, Parkways, rural 
landscapes, and, in the 1960s, a 
new group of Women. 

In 1968 de Kooning visited the 
Netherlands for the first time since 
1926 for the opening of his major 
retrospective at the Stedelijk 
Museum in Amsterdam. In Rome 
in 1969 he executed his first 
sculptures — figures modeled in 
clay and later cast in bronze — and 
in 1970-71 he began a series of 
life-size figures. In 1974 tne 
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis 
organized a show of de Kooning's 
drawings and sculpture that 
traveled throughout the United 
States, and in 1978 the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum, New 
York, mounted an important 
exhibition of his recent work. In 
1979 de Kooning and Eduardo 
Chillida received the Andrew W. 
Mellon Prize, which was 
accompanied by an exhibition at 
the Museum of Art, Carnegie 
Institute, in Pittsburgh. De 
Kooning lives in the Springs, East 
Hampton, Long Island, where he 
settled in 1963. 



ROBERT DELAUNAY 

1885-1941 

Robert-Victor-Felix Delaunay was 
born in Paris on April 12, 1885. In 
1902, after secondary education, 
he apprenticed in a studio for 
theater sets in Belleville. In 1903 
he started painting and by 1904 
was exhibiting, that year and in 
1906 at the Salon d'Automne and 
from 1904 until World War I at 
the Salon des Independants. 
Between 1905 and 1907 Delaunay 
became friendly with Henri 
Rousseau and Jean Metzinger and 
studied the color theories of M. E. 
Chevreul; he was then painting in 
a Neo-Impressionist manner. Paul 
Cezanne's work also influenced 
Delaunay around this time. From 
190--08 he served in the military 
in Laon and upon returning to 



Paris he had contact with the 
Cubists. The period 1909-10 saw 
the emergence of Delaunay's 
personal style: he painted his first 
Eiffel Tower in 1909. In 1910 
Delaunay married the painter 
Sonia Terk, who became his 
collaborator on many projects. 

Delaunay's participation in 
exhibitions in Germany and 
association with advanced artists 
working there began in 191 1, the 
year Vasily Kandinsky invited him 
to participate in the first Blaue 
Reiter (Blue Rider) exhibition in 
Munich. At this time he became 
friendly with Guillaume 
Apollinaire, Albert Gleizes, and 
Henri Le Fauconnier. In 19 12 
Delaunay's first solo show took 
place at the Galerie Barbazanges, 
Paris, and he began his Windows 
pictures. Inspired by the lyricism 
of color of the Windows, 
Apollinaire invented the term 
"Orphism" or "Orphic Cubism" 
to describe Delaunay's work. In 
191 3 Delaunay painted his 
Circular Form or Disc pictures. 

From 19 14 to 1920 Delaunay 
lived in Spain and Portugal and 
became friends with Sergei 
Diaghilev, Leonide Massine, Diego 
Rivera, and Igor Stravinsky. He 
designed the decor for the Ballets 
Russes in 1918. By 1920 he had 
returned to Paris, where, in 1922, 
a major exhibition of his work 
was held at Galerie Paul Guillaume 
and he began his second Eiffel 
Tower series. In 1924 he 
undertook his Runner paintings 
and in 1925 executed frescoes for 
the Palais de l'Ambassade de 
France at the Exposition 
Internationale des arts decoratifs in 
Paris. In 1937 he completed murals 
for the Palais des Chemins de Fer 
and Palais de I' Air at the Paris 
World's Fair. His last works were 
decorations for the sculpture hall 
of the Salon des Tuileries in 19 58. 
In 1939 he helped organize the 
exhibition Realites nouvelles. 
Delaunay died in Montpellier on 
October 2,5, 1 941 • 



PAUL DELVAUX 

1 897-1994 

Paul Delvaux was born on 
September 2,3, 189-, in Antheit, 
Belgium. At the Academie Royale 
des Beaux-Arts in Brussels he 



studied architecture from 19 16 to 
19 17 and decorative painting 
from 1 9 1 X to 1 9 1 9. During the 
early 1920s he was influenced by 
James Ensor and Gustave De 
Smet. In 1936 Delvaux shared an 
exhibition at the Palais des Beaux- 
Arts in Brussels with Rene 
Magritte, a fellow member of the 
Belgian group Les Compagnons 
de ['Art. 

Delvaux was given solo 
exhibitions in 1938 at the Palais 
des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, and the 
London Gallery, the latter 
organized by E. L. T. Mesens and 
Roland Penrose. That same year 
he participated in the Exposition 
Internationale du surrealisme at 
the Galerie des Beaux-Arts in 
Paris, organized by Andre Breton 
and Paul Eluard, and an 
exhibition of the same title at the 
Galerie Robert in Amsterdam. 
The artist visited Italy in 1938 
and 1939. His first retrospective 
was held at the Palais des Beaux- 
Arts in Brussels in 1944-45. 
Delvaux executed stage designs 
for Jean Genet's Adame Miroire in 
1947 and collaborated with 
Eluard on the book Poemes, 
peintures et dessins, published in 
Geneva and Paris the next year. 
After a brief sojourn in France in 
1949, the following year he was 
appointed professor at the Ecole 
Supeneure d"Art et d'Archirecture 
in Brussels, a position he retained 
until 1962. From the early 1950s 
he executed a number of mural 
commissions in Belgium. About 
the middle of the decade Delvaux 
settled in Boitsfort, and in 1956 
he traveled to Greece. 

From 1965 to 1966 Delvaux 
served as president and director of 
the Academie Royale des Beaux- 
Arts of Belgium, and about this 
time he produced his first 
lithographs. Retrospectives of his 
work were held at the Palais des 
Beaux-Arts in Lille in 1965, at the 
Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris 
in 1969, and at the Museum 
Boymans-van Beuningen in 
Rotterdam in 19-3. Also in 1973 
he was awarded the Rembrandt 
Prize of the Johann Wolfgang 
Stiftung. A Delvaux retrospective 
was shown at the National 
Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo 
and the National Museum of 
Modern Art of Kyoto in 1975. In 
1977 he became an associate 



member of the Academie des 
Beaux-Arts of France. Delvaux 
died in Veurne, Belgium, on 
July 20, i9s&gt;4- 



JEAN DUBUFFET 

19OI-1985 

Jean Dubuffet was born in Le 
Havre on July 31, 1901. He 
attended art classes in his youth 
and in 191 8 moved to Paris to 
study at the Academie Julian, 
which he left after six months. 
During this time Dubuffet met 
Raoul Dufy, Max Jacob, Fernand 
Leger, and Suzanne Valadon and 
became fascinated with Hans 
Prinzhorn's book on psychopathic 
art. He traveled to Italy in 1923 
and South America in 1924. Then 
Dubuffet gave up painting for 
about ten years, working as an 
industrial draftsman and later in 
the family w^ine business. He 
committed himself to becoming 
an artist in 1942. 

Dubuffet's first solo exhibition 
was held at the Galerie Rene 
Drouin in Paris in 1944. During 
the 1940s the artist associated 
with Andre Breton, Georges 
Limbour, Jean Paulhan, and 
Charles Ratton. His style and 
subject matter in this period owed 
a debt to Paul Klee. From 1945 ne 
collected Art Brut, spontaneous, 
direct works by untutored 
individuals, such as mental 
patients. The Pierre Matisse 
Gallery gave him his first solo 
show in New York in 194"". 

From 1951 to 1952 Dubuffet 
lived in New York. He then 
returned to Paris, where a 
retrospective of his work took 
place at the Cercle Volney in 1954. 
His first museum retrospective 
occurred in 1957 at the Schloss 
Morsbroich, Leverkusen, 
Germany. Major Dubuffet 
exhibitions have since been held at 
the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, 
Paris, the Museum of Modern Art, 
New York, the Art Institute of 
Chicago, the Stedelijk Museum, 
Amsterdam, the Tate Gallery, 
London, and the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum. His 
paintings of LHourloupe, a series 
begun in 1962, were exhibited at 
the Palazzo Grassi in Venice in 
1964. A collection of Dubuffet's 
writings. Prospectus et tons cents 



suivants, was published in 1 967, 
the same year he started his 
architectural structures. Soon 
thereafter he began numerous 
commissions for monumental 
outdoor sculptures. In 1971 he 
produced his first theater props, 
the "practicables. " A major 
Dubuffet retrospective was 
presented at the Akademie der 
Kunste, Berlin, the Museum 
Moderner Kunst, Vienna, and the 
Joseph-Haubrichkunsthalle, 
Cologne, in 1980-81.111 J981 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum observed the artist's 
eightieth birthday with an 
exhibition. Dubuffet died in Paris 
on May 12, 1985. 



MARCEL DUCHAMP 

1887-1968 

Henri -Robert-Marcel Duchamp 
was born on July 28, 1887, near 
Blainville, France. In 1904 he 
joined his artist brothers, Jacques 
Villon and Raymond Duchamp- 
Villon, in Paris, where he studied 
painting at the Academie Julian 
until 1905. Duchamp's early 
works were Post-Impressionist in 
style. He exhibited for the first 
time in 1909 at the Salon des 
Independants and the Salon 
d'Automne in Paris. His paintings 
of 191 1 were directly related 
to Cubism but emphasized 
successive images of a single body 
in motion. In 1912 he painted the 
definitive version of Nude 
Descending a Staircase; this was 
shown at the Salon de la Section 
d'Or of that same year and 
subsequently created great 
controversy at the Armory Show 
in New York in 1 91 3. 

Duchamp's radical and 
iconoclastic ideas predated the 
founding of the Dada movement 
in Zurich in 19 16. By 19 13 he 
had abandoned traditional 
painting and drawing for various 
experimental forms including 
mechanical drawings, studies, and 
notations that would be 
incorporated in a major work, 
The Bride Stripped Bare by Her 
Bachelors, Even of 191 s-23. In 
1 914 Duchamp introduced his 
readymades — common objects, 
sometimes altered, presented as 
works of art — which had a 
revolutionary impact upon many 



22; 



painters and sculptors. In 191 5 
Duchamp came to New York, 
where his circle included 
Katherine Dreier and Man Ray, 
with whom he founded the 
Societe Anonyme, as well as 
Louise and Walter Arensberg, 
Francis Picabia, and other avant- 
garde figures. 

After playing chess avidly for 
nine months in Buenos Aires, 
Duchamp returned to France in 
the summer of 1919 and 
associated with the Dada group in 
Paris. In New York in 1920 he 
made his first motor-driven 
constructions and invented Rrose 
Selavy, his feminine alter ego. 
Duchamp moved back to Paris in 
1923 and seemed to have 
abandoned art for chess but in fact 
continued his artistic experiments. 
From the mid-19 30s be 
collaborated with the Surrealists 
and participated in their 
exhibitions. Duchamp settled 
permanently in New York in 1942 
and became a United States citizen 
in 1955. During the 1940s he 
associated and exhibited with the 
Surrealist emigres in New York, 
and in 1946 began Etant donnes, a 
major assemblage on which he 
worked secretly for the next 
twenty years. He died in the Paris 
suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine on 
October 2, 1968. 



RAYMOND DUCHAMP- 
VILLON 

1876-1918 

Raymond Duchamp-Villon was 
born Pierre-Maurice-Raymond 
Duchamp on November 5, 1876, 
in Damville, near Rouen. From 
1894 to 1898 he studied medicine 
at the University of Paris. When 
illness forced him to abandon his 
studies, he decided to make a 
career in sculpture, until then an 
avocation. During the early years 
of the century he moved to Paris, 
where he exhibited for the first 
time at the Salon de la Societe 
Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1902. 
His second show was held at the 
same Salon in 1 903, the year he 
settled in Neuilly-sur-Seine. In 
1905 he had his first exhibition at 
the Salon d'Automne and a show 
at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen 
with his brother, the painter 
Jacques Villon; he moved with 



him to Puteaux two years later. 

His participation in the jury of 
the sculpture section of the Salon 
d'Automne began in 1907 and was 
instrumental in promoting the 
Cubists in the early 1 9 1 os. Around 
this time he, Villon, and their other 
brother, Marcel Duchamp, 
attended weekly meetings of the 
Puteaux group of artists and crit- 
ics. In 1911 he exhibited at the 
Galerie de I' Art Contemporain in 
Paris; the following year his work 
was included in a show organized 
by the Duchamp brothers at the 
Salon de la Section d'Or at the 
Galerie de la Boetie. Duchamp- 
Villon's work was exhibited at the 
Armory Show in New York in 
1913 and the Galerie Andre Groult 
in Paris, the Galerie S. V. U. Manes 
in Prague, and Der Sturm gallery in 
Berlin in 19 14. During World War 
I Duchamp-Villon served in the 
army in a medical capacity, but 
was able to continue work on his 
major sculpture The Horse. He 
contracted typhoid fever in late 
1916 while stationed at 
Champagne; the disease ultimately 
resulted in his death on October 9, 
1918, in the military hospital 
at Cannes. 



MAX ERNST 

1891-1976 

Max Ernst was born on April 2, 
1 89 1, in Bruhl, Germany. He 
enrolled in the University at Bonn 
in 1909 to study philosophy, but 
soon abandoned this pursuit to 
concentrate on art. At this time he 
was interested in psychology and 
the art of the mentally ill. In 1 9 1 1 
Ernst became a friend of August 
Macke and joined the Rheinische 
Expressionisten group in Bonn. 
Ernst showed for the first time in 
1912 at the Galerie Feldman in 
Cologne. At the Sonderbund 
exhibition of that year in Cologne 
he saw the work of Paul Cezanne, 
Edvard Munch, Pablo Picasso, 
and Vincent van Gogh. In 1 9 1 3 he 
met Guillaume Apollinaire and 
Robert Delaunay and traveled to 
Paris. Ernst participated that same 
year in the Erste deutsche 
Herbstsalon. In 1914 he met Jean 
Arp, who was to become a 
lifelong friend. 

Despite military service 
throughout World War I, Ernst 



was able to continue painting and 
to exhibit in Berlin at Der Sturm in 
19 1 6. He returned to Cologne in 
191 8. The next year he produced 
his first collages and founded the 
short-lived Cologne Dada 
movement with Johannes Theodor 
Baargeld; they were joined by Arp 
and others. In 1921 Ernst 
exhibited for the first time in Paris, 
at the Galerie au Sans Pared. He 
was involved in Surrealist 
activities in the early 1920s with 
Paul Eluard and Andre Breton. In 
1925 Ernst executed his first 
frottages; a series of frottages was 
published in his book Histoire 
naturelle in 1926. He collaborated 
with Joan Miro on designs for 
Sergei Diaghilev that same year. 
The first of his collage-novels, 
La Femme 100 tetes, was 
published in 1929. The following 
year the artist collaborated with 
Salvador Dali and Luis Buhuel on 
the film L'Age d'or. 

His first American show was 
held at the Julien Levy Gallery, 
New York, in 1932. In 1936 Ernst 
was represented in Fantastic Art, 
Dada, Surrealism at the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York. In 
1939 he was interned in France as 
an enemy alien. Two years later 
Ernst fled to the United States with 
Peggy Guggenheim, whom he 
married early in 1942. After their 
divorce he married Dorothea 
Tanning and in 1953 resettled in 
France. Ernst received the Grand 
Prize for painting at the Venice 
Biennale in 1954, and in 1975 the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
gave him a major retrospective, 
which traveled in modified form to 
the Musee National d'Art 
Moderne, Paris, in 1975. He died 
on April 1, 1976, in Paris. 



ALBERTO GIACOMETTI 

1901-1966 

Alberto Giacometti was born on 
October 10, 1901, in Borgonovo, 
Switzerland, and grew up in the 
nearby town of Stampa. His 
father Giovanni was a Post-

the works of Paul Cezanne and 
Alexander Archipenko at the 

Venice Biennale. He was also 
deeply affected by primitive and 
Egyptian art and by the 
masterpieces of Giotto and 
Tintoretto. In 1922 Giacometti 
settled in Paris, making frequent 
visits ro Stampa. From time to 
rime over the next several years he

ALBERT GLEIZES 

r88i- I95 3 

Albert Gleizes was born in Paris 
on December 8, 1 88 1 . He worked 
in his father's tabnc design studio 
after completing secondary 
school. While serving in the arm)

for the first time at the Societe 
Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Pans, 
in 1902, and participated in 
the Salon d'Automne in 1903 
and 1904. 

With several friends, including 
the writer Rene Arcos, Gleizes 
founded the Abbaye de Creteil 
outside Paris in 1906. This 
Utopian community of artists and 
writers scorned bourgeois society 
and sought to create a 
nonallegorical, epic art based on 
modern themes. The Abbaye 
closed in 1908 due to financial 
difficulties. In 1909 and 19 10 
Gleizes met Robert Delaunay, 
Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand 
Leger, and Jean Metzinger. In

In 1 914 Gleizes again saw 
military service. His paintings had 
become abstract by 19 15. Travels 
to New York, Barcelona, and 
Bermuda during the next four 
years influenced his stylistic 
evolution. His first solo show was 
held at the Galeries Dalmau, 
Barcelona, in 19 16. Beginning in 
19 1 8 Gleizes became deeply 
involved in a search for spiritual 
values, as reflected in his painting 
and writing. In 1927 he founded 
Moly-Sabata, another Utopian 
community of artists and 
craftsmen, in Sablons. His book, 
La Forme et I'histoire, published 
in 19^2, examines Romanesque. 
Oltic, and Oriental art. In the 
1930s Gleizes participated in the 
Abstraction-Creation group. Later

World's Fair of 1937. In 1947 a 
major Gleizes retrospective took 
place in Lyons at the Chapelle du 



I ycee Ampere. From 1949 to 
1950 Gleizes worked on 
illustrations tor Pascal's Pensees.

ARSHILE GORKY 

1 904- 1 948 

Arshile Gorky was born Vosdanik 
Adoian in the village of Khorkom, 
province of Van, Armenia, on

painting with the academic artist 
Jose Maria Carbonero. In 1906 he 
moved to Paris, where he lived for 
most of the remainder of his life. 
His friends in Paris included 
Georges Braque, Fernand Leger,

Guillaume Apollinaire, Max 
Jacob, and Maurice Raynal. 
Although he continued to submit 
humorous illustrations to journals 
such as L'Assiette au beurre, Le 
Charivari, and Le Cri de Paris,

signed Gris to a contract that gave 
Kahnweiler exclusive rights to the 
artist's work. Gris became a good 
friend of Henri Matisse in 1914 
and over the next several years 
formed close relationships with 
Jacques Lipchitz and Jean 
Metzinger. After Kahnweiler fled 
Paris at the outbreak of World 
War I, Gris signed a contract with 
Leonce Rosenberg in 191 6. His 
first major solo show was held at

Pomerania and then Stettin. 
Helion escaped in 1942 and that 
same year made his way to France 
and then the United States. In 
1943 ne began to paint in a

1879-1940 

Paul Klee was born on December 
18, 1879, in Munchenbuchsee, 
Switzerland, into a family of 
musicians. His childhood love of 
music was always to remain 
profoundly important in his life 
and work. From 1898 to 1901 Klee 
studied in Munich, first with 
Hem rich Knirr, then at the 
AJcademie under Franz von Stuck. 
Upon completing his schooling, he

He settled in Bern in 1902. A series 
of his satirical etchings was 
exhibited at the Munich Secession 
in 1906. That same year Klee 
married and moved to Munich. 
Here he gained exposure to

the second time, where he saw the 
work of Pablo Picasso and Georges 
Braque and met Robert Delaunay. 
Klee helped found the Ncue 
Miinchner Secession in 1914-

FRANTISEK KUPKA 
1871-1957 

Frantisek Kupka was born on 
September 22, 1871, in Opocno in 
eastern Bohemia. From 1889 to 
1892 he studied at the Prague 
Academy. At this time he painted 
historical and patriotic themes. In 
1892 Kupka enrolled at the 
Akademie der Bildenden Kiinste in 
Vienna where he concentrated on 
symbolic and allegorical subjects. 
He exhibited at the Kunstverein, 
Vienna, in 1894. His involvement 
with theosophy and Eastern 
philosophy dates from this period. 
By spring 1896 Kupka had settled 
in Paris; there he attended the 
Academie Julian briefly and then 
studied with J. P. Laurens at the 
Ecole des Beaux-Arts. 

Kupka worked as an illustrator

known for his satirical drawings 
tor newspapers and magazines. In 
1 906 he settled in Puteaux, a 
suburb of Paris, and that same 
year exhibited for the first time at 
the Salon d'Automne. Kupka was 
deeply impressed by the hist 
Futurist Manifesto, published in 
1909 in / e Figaro. Kupka's work 
became increasingly abstract 
around 1 910-1 1, reflecting his 
theories of motion, color, and the 



relationship between music and 
painting. In 191 1 he attended 
meetings of the Puteaux group. In 
1 9 1 2 he exhibited at the Salon des 
Independants in the Cubist room, 
although he did not wish to be

Doesburg, and Georges 
Vantongerloo; in 1936 his work 
was included in the exhibition 
Cubism and Abstract Art at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New 
York, and in an important show 
with Alphonse Mucha at the Jeu 
de Paume, Paris. A major 
retrospective of his work took 
place at the Galerie S. V. U. Manes 
in Prague in 1946. The same year 
Kupka participated in the Salon 
des Realites Nouvelles, Pans, 
where he continued to exhibit 
regularly until his death. During 
the early 1950s he gained general 
recognition and had several solo 
shows in New York. Kupka died in 
Puteaux on June 24, 1957. 
Important Kupka retrospectives 
were held at the Musee National 
d'Art Moderne, Paris, in 1958 and 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum, New York, in 1975. 



HENRI LAURENS 

1885-1954 

Henri Laurens was born on 
February 18, 1S85, in Pans, where 
he attended drawing classes in 
1899. The sculpture he produced 
during the early years of the 
twentieth century reflects the 
influence of Auguste Rodin. In 
191 1 the sculptor entered into a 
lifelong friendship with Georges 
Braque, who introduced him to 
Cubism. 1 aureus participated for 
the first time in the Salon des 
Independants in Pans in 1 9 1 3, and 
two ) ears later met Juan ( iris. 
Amedeo Modigliam, and Pablo 
Picasso, from 1916 Laurens 
executed Cubist collages and 
constructions. He became a friend 



ZlH 



of Pierre Reverdy in 191 5 and 
illustrated the writer's Poetnes en 
prose that same year. 

The artist was given a solo 
show at Leonce Rosenberg's 
Galerie I'Effort Moderne in Paris 
in 1917, and signed a contract 
there the following year. During 
the 1 920s he executed designs for 
various architectural projects and 
stage decors. From 1932 to 1933 
he divided his time between Paris 
and nearby Etang-la-Ville, where 
his neighbors were Aristide 
Maillol and Ker-Xavier Roussel. 
Laurens contributed substantially 
to the World's Fair in Paris in 
1937. In 1938 he shared an 
exhibition with Braque and 
Picasso that traveled from Oslo to 
Stockholm and Copenhagen. His 
work was shown in 1945 at tne 
Galerie Louis Carre in Paris and in 
194- at the Buchholz Gallery in 
New York. About this time 
Laurens made prints for book 
illustrations. He was represented 
at the Venice Biennale in 1948 and 
1950. An important exhibition of 
his work was organized by the 
Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels 
in 1949, and a major Laurens

FERNAND LEGER 

1881-1955 

Jules Fernand Henri Leger was 
born on February 4, 1881, in 
Argentan, Normandy. After 
apprenticing with an architect in 
Caen from 1897 to 1899, Leger 
settled in Paris in 1900 and 
supported himself as an 
architectural draftsman. He was 
refused entrance to the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts, but nevertheless 
attended classes there; he also 
studied at the Aeademie Julian. 
Leger's earliest known works, 
which date from 1905, were 
primarily influenced by 



Impressionism. The experience of 
seeing the Paul Cezanne 
retrospective at the Salon 
d'Automne in 190- and his 
contact with the early Cubism of 
Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque 
had an extremely significant 
impact on the development of his 
personal style. In 19 10 he- 
exhibited with Braque and Picasso 
at D.-H. Kahnweiler's gallery, 
where he was given a solo show in 
19 1 2. From 1911 to 1914 Leger's 
work became increasingly abstract, 
and he started to limit his color to 
the primaries and black and white. 

Leger served in the military 
from 191410 191 7. His 
"mechanical" period, in which 
figures and objects are 
characterized by tubular, 
machinelike forms, began in 1917. 
During the early 1920s he 
collaborated with the writer Blaise 
Cendrars on films and designed 
sets and costumes for Rolf de 
Mare's Ballet suedois; in 192^-24 
he made his first film without a 
plot, Ballet mecanique. Leger 
opened an atelier with Amedee 
Ozenfant in 1924 and in 1925 
presented his first murals at Le 
Corbusier's Pavilion de l'Esprit 
Nouveau at the Exposition 
Internationale des arts decoratifs. 
In 193 1 he visited the United States 
for the first time. In 1935 the 
Museum of Modern Art, New 
York, and the Art Institute of 
Chicago presented exhibitions of 
his work. Leger lived in the United 
States from 1940 to 1945 but 
returned to France after the war. In 
the decade before his death Leger's 
wide-ranging projects included 
book illustrations, monumental 
figure paintings and murals, 
stained-glass windows, mosaics, 
polychrome ceramic sculptures, 
and set and costume designs. In 
1955 he won the Grand Prize at 
the Sao Paulo Bienal. Leger died 
on August 17, 1955, at his home in 
Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The Musee 
National Fernand Leger was 
founded in 19s - in Biot. 



JACQUES LIPCHITZ

Chaim Jacob Lipschit/ was born 
on August 22, 1 89 1, in 
Druskieniki, Lithuania. At age 
eighteen he moved to Paris, where 



he attended the Ecole des Beaux- 
Arrs and the Aeademie Julian and 
soon met Georges Braque, Juan 
Gris, and Pablo Picasso. In 19 12 
he began exhibiting at the Salon 
National des Beaux-Arts and the 
Salon d'Automne. Lipchitz's first 
solo show was held at Leonce

and the following year moved to 
Boulogne-sur-Seine. He received a 
commission from the Vicomte 
Charles de Noailles in 1927 for the 
sculpture Joy of Life. 

Lipchitz's first important 
retrospective took place at Jeanne 
Bucher's Galerie de la Renaissance 
in Paris in 1930. The Brummer 
Gallery in New York hosted his 
first large show in the United 
States in 1935. In 1941 Lipchitz 
fled Paris for New York, where he 
began exhibiting regularly at the 
Buchholz Gallery (later the Curt 
Valentin Gallery). He settled in 
Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, 
in 1947. In 1954 a Lipchitz 
retrospective traveled from the 
Museum of Modern Art in New 
York to the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis and the Cleveland 
Museum of Art. In 1958 Lipchitz 
collaborated with the architect 
Philip Johnson on the Roofless

in 1963. From 1964 to 1966 
Lipchitz showed annually at the 
Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in 
New York. Beginning in 196} he 
spent several months of each year 
casting in Pietrasanta, Italy. 

From 1970 until 1973 he 
worked on large-scale 
commissions for the Municipal 
Plaza in Philadelphia, Columbia 
University in New York, and the 
Hadassah Medical Center near 
Jerusalem. These projects were 
completed by Lipchitz's wife, 
Yulla, after his death. In iy~2 the 
artist's autobiography was 
published on the occasion of an 
exhibition of his sculpture at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 



2.2.9 



New York. Lipchitz died on May 
2.6, 1973, on Capri, and was 
buried in Jerusalem. 



EL LISSITZKY 

1890-1941 

El Lissitzky was born Lazar 
Markovich Lisitskii on 
November 23, 1:890, in Pochinok, 

in the Russian province of 
Smolensk, and grew up in Vitebsk. 
He pursued architectural studies 
at the Technische Hochschule in 
Darmstadt from 1909 to 1914, 
when the outbreak of World War I 
precipitated his return to Russia. 
In 1 9 1 6 he received a diploma in 
engineering and architecture from 
the Riga Technological University. 

Lissitzky and Kazimir Malevich 
were invited by Marc Chagall to 
join the faculty of the Vitebsk 
Popular Art School in 1919; there 
Lissitzky taught architecture and 
graphics. That same year he 
executed his first Proun (acronym 
in Russian for "project for the 
affirmation of the new") and 
formed part of the Unovis group. 
In 1920 he became a member of 
Inkhuk (Institute for Artistic 
Culture) in Moscow and designed 
his book Pro dva kvadrata (About 
Two Squares). The following year 
he taught at Vkhutemas (Higher 
State Art-Technical Studios) with 
Vladimir Tatlin and joined the 
Constructivist group. The 
Constructivists exhibited at the 
Erste ritssiscbe Kunstausstellung 
designed by Lissitzky at the 
Galerie van Diemen in Berlin in 
1922. During this period he 
collaborated with Ilya Ehrenburg 
on the journal 
Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet. 

In 1 923 the artist experimented 
with new typographic design for a 
book by Vladimir Mayakovski, 
Dlya golosa 1 For the Voice), and 
visited Hannover where his work 
was shown under the auspices of 
the Kestner-desellschaft. Also in 
1923 Lissitzky created his Proun 
environment for the Grosse 
Berliner Kunstausstellung and 
executed his lithographic suites 
Proun and Victory over the Sun 
1 illustrating the opera by Alcxei 
Kruchenykh and Mikhail 
Matiushin), before traveling to 
Switzerland for medical treatment. 
In 1924 he worked with Kurt 



Schwitters on the issue of the 
periodical Merz called "Nasci," 
and with Arp on the book Die 
Kunstismen {The Isms of Art). 
The next year he returned to 
Moscow to teach at Vkhutemas- 
Vkhutein (Higher State Art- 
Technical Studios-Higher State 
Art-Technical Institute), which he 
continued to do until 1930. 
During the mid- 1920s Lissitzky 
stopped painting in order to 
concentrate on the design of 
typography and exhibitions. He 
created a room for the 
Internationale Kunstausstellung in 
Dresden in 1926 and another

KAZIMIR MALEVICH 

1878-1935 

Kazimir Severinovich Malevich 
was born on February 26, i8~8, 
near Kiev, Ukraine. He studied at 
the Moscow Institute of Painting, 
Sculpture, and Architecture in 
1903. During the early years of his 
career he experimented with 
various Modernist styles and 
participated in avant-garde 
exhibitions, such as those of the 
Moscow Artists' Association, 
which included Vasily Kandmsky 
and Mikhail Larionov, and the 
Jack of Diamonds of 19 10 in 
Moscow. Malevich showed his 
neo-primitivist paintings of 
peasants at the exhibition 
Donkey's Tail in 1 9 1 1. After this 
exhibition he broke with 
Larionov's group. In 1913, with 
composer Mikhail Matiushin and 
writer Alexei Kruchenykh, 
Malevich drafted a manifesto for 
the First Futurist Congress. That 
same year he designed the sets and 
costumes for the opera Victory

the Salon des Independants in 
Paris in 19 14. 

Ar the 0.10 Last Futurist 
Exhibition in Petrograd in 191 5, 
Malevich introduced his non- 
objective, geometric Suprematist 
paintings. In 19 19 he began to 
explore the three-dimensional 
applications of Suprematism in 
architectural models. Following 
the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, 
Malevich and other advanced 
artists were encouraged hy the 
Soviet government and attained 
prominent administrative and 
teaching positions. Malevich 
hegan teaching at the Vitehsk 
Popular Art School in 1 9 1 9; he 
soon became its director. In 
1919-20 he was given a solo

Exhibition in Moscow, which 
focused on Suprematism and 
other non-objective styles. 
Malevich and his students at 
Vitehsk formed the Suprematist 
group Unovis. From 1922 to 192 - 
he taught at the Institute of 
Artistic Culture in Petrograd and 
between 1924 and 1926 he 
worked primarily on architectural 
models with his students. 

In 192- Malevich traveled 
with an exhibition of his 
paintings to Warsaw and also 
went to Berlin, where his work 
was shown at the Grosse Berliner 
Kunstausstellung. In Germain he 
met Jean Arp, Xaum Gabo, 
Le Corbusier, and Kurt Schwitters 
and visited the Bauhaus where he 
met Walter Gropius. The 
Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow gave 
Malevich a solo exhibition in 
1929. Because of his connections 
with German artists he was 
arrested in 1930, and many of 
his manuscripts were destroyed. 
In his final period he painted 
in a representational style. 
Malevich died in Leningrad on 
May E5, 1935. 



MAN RAY 
1890-1976 

Man Ray (a pseudonym adopted 

by the artist) was born on August 
2-, 1X90, in Philadelphia, and 
moved to New York with his 
family seven years later. In New 
York he frequented Alfred 
Stieglitz's gallery "29 1 " in 1 9 1 1 
and attended classes at the Ferrer 



Center in 191 2. In 1 9 1 5 his first

medium for which he was to 
become best known. Fie entered 
into a htelong friendship with 
Marcel Duchamp, with whom he 
and Walter Arensberg founded the 
Society of Independent Artists in 
[916. With Duchamp, (Catherine 
Dreier, Henry Hudson, and 
Andrew McLaren, Man Ray 
established the Societe Anonyme. 
which he named, in 1920. Before 
the artist moved from New York 
to Paris in 1921, Man Ray and 
Duchamp published the single 
issue of New York Dada. 

In Paris Man Ray was given a 
solo exhibition at the Librairie Six 
in 1921. His first Rayographs

Hollywood and then to New 
York. In 195 1 he returned to 
Paris, where he was given a solo 
show ar the Galerie Berggruen. In 
1959 a solo exhibition of Man 
Ray's work was held at the 
Institute of Contemporary Art in 
London. His autobiography Self 
Portrait was published in 1963. 
Ten years later the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York 



presented [2.5 of his photographic 
works. Man Rav died on

LOUIS MARCOUSSIS 

[878-194] 

Louis Marcoussis was born 
Ludwig Casimir Ladislas Markus 

in Warsaw on Nov ember 1 4, 
1 S-S. In 1 901 he entered the 
Academy of Fine Arts of Cracow 
to study painting with Jan 
Grzegorz Stanislawski. In 1903 
Markus moved to Paris, where he 
worked briefly under Jules 
Lefebvre at the Academic Julian 
and became a friend of Roger de 
La Fresnaye and Robert Lotiron. 
He exhibited for the first time at 
the Salon d'Automne in 1905 and 
at the Salon des Independants in 
1906. and was often represented 
in both salons in subsequent years. 

In Paris he made his living by 
selling caricatures to satirical 
periodicals, including La Vie 
parisienne and Le journal. He 
frequented the cafes, such as the 
Rotonde, Cirque Medrano, and 
the Ermitage, where he met Edgar 
Degas about 1906 and Guillaume 
Apollinaire, Georges Braque, and 
Pablo Picasso in 1910. In 1907 
Markus abandoned painting; 
when he began to paint again in 
1910, he discarded his earlier 
Impressionist style to adopt the 
new Cubist idiom. About 191 1, at 
the suggestion of Apollinaire, he 
began calling himself Marcoussis, 
the name of a village near 
Monthery. In 1912 the artist 
participated in the Salon de la 
Section d'Or at the Galerie de la 
Boetie in Paris. By this time his 
circle included Juan Gris, Max 
Jacob, Fernand Leger, Jean 
Metzinger, and Francis Picabia. 
He served in the army from 1 9 1 4 
to 191 9, returning to Poland for a 
visit after his demobilization. 

Marcoussis exhibited in 1921 
at Der Sturm gallery in Berlin with 
Albert Gleizes, Jacques Villon, and 
others. He had his first solo show 
at Galerie Pierre, Paris, in 192s. 
This was followed by solo 
exhibitions in 192S at the Galerie 
le C entaure in Brussels, a city he 
visited on that occasion, and at the 
Galerie Georges Bernheim in Pans 
in 1929. In r.930 the artist made 
the first of manj trips to England 



and met Helena Rubinstein, who 
became his supporter. In 1934-35 
he stayed for several months in the 
United States, where solo shows of 
his prints opened at the Arts Club 
of Chicago in 1934 and M. 
Knoedler and Co. in New York in 
1935. Marcoussis worked almost 
exclusively in graphics from 1930 
to 1937; a retrospective of his 
prints took place at the Palais des 
Beaux-Arts in Brussels in 1936. 
The artist traveled to England and 
Italy in 1938, and during the 
following year was given a solo 
exhibition at the London Gallery 
in London. In 1 940, as the 
German army advanced, 
Marcoussis left Paris for Cusset, 
near Vichy, where he died on 
October 2.2., 1941. 



MARINO MARINI 

1901-1980 

Marino Marini was born in the 
Tuscan town of Pistoia on 
February 27, 1901. He attended 
the Accademia di Belle Arti in 
Florence in 191 7. Although he 
never abandoned painting, Marini 
devoted himself primarily to 
sculpture from about 1922. From 
this time his work was influenced 
by Etruscan art and the sculpture 
of Arturo Martini. Marini 
succeeded Martini as professor at 
the Scuola d'Arte di Villa Reale in 
Monza, near Milan, in 1929, a 
position he retained until 1940. 
During this period Marini traveled 
frequently to Paris, where he 
associated with Massimo 
Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, 
Alberto Magnelli, and Filippo 
Tibertelli de Pisis. In 1936 he 
moved to Tenero-Locarno, in the 
Ticino canton, Switzerland; during 
the following few years the artist 
often visited Zurich and Basel, 
where he became a friend of 
Alberto Giacometti, Germaine 
Richier, and Fritz Wotruba. In 
1936 he received the Prize of the 
Quadriennale of Rome. He 
accepted a professorship in 
sculpture at the Accademia di 
Belle Arti di Brera, Milan, in 1940. 

In 1 946 the artist settled 
permanently in Milan. He 
participated in Twentieth -Century 
Italian Art at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York in 1944- 
( urt Valentin began exhibiting 



Marini's work at his Buchholz 
Gallery in New York in 1950, on 
which occasion the sculptor 
visited the city and met Jean Arp, 
Max Beckmann, Alexander 
Calder, Lyonel Feininger, and 
Jacques Lipchitz. On his return to 
Europe, he stopped in London, 
where the Hanover Gallery had 
organized a solo show of his 
work, and there met Henry 
Moore. In 195 1 a Marini 
exhibition traveled from the 
Kestner-Gesellschaft Hannover to 
the Kunstverein in Hamburg and 
the Haus der Kunst of Munich. He 
was awarded the Grand Prize for 
Sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 
1952 and the Feltrinelli Prize at 
the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome 
in 1954. One of his monumental 
sculptures was installed in the 
Hague in 1959. 

Retrospectives of Marini's 
work took place at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich in 1962 and at the Palazzo 
Venezia in Rome in 1966. His 
paintings were exhibited for the 
first time at Toninelli Arte 
Moderna in Milan in 1963-64. In 
1973 a permanent installation of 
his work opened at the Galleria 
d'Arte Moderna in Milan, and in 
1978 a Marini show was 
presented at the National Museum 
of Modern Art in Tokyo. Marini 
died on August 6, 1980, in 
Viareggio. 



JEAN METZINGER 

1883-1956 

Jean Metzinger was born in 
Nantes, France, on June 24, 1883. 
At the age of twenty he moved to 
Paris to pursue a career as a 
painter. One of his early friends in 
Paris was Robert Delaunay. About 
1 908 he met the writer Max 
Jacob, who introduced him to 
Guillaume Apollinaire and his 
circle, which included Georges 
Braque and Pablo Picasso. Picasso 
was to have a significant influence 
on Metzinger from this time to 
about [923. In 1 9 10 Metzinger 
exhibited for the first time at the 
Salon des Independants. In 19 10 
and 191 1 he published several 
articles on contemporary painting 
and afterwards periodically 
contributed to the literature on 
Modern art. Met/inger was the 
first to note in print that Picasso 



and Braque had dismissed 
traditional perspective and merged 
multiple views of an object in a 
single image; his article on this 
subject appeared in Pan in 19 10. 

In 1 9 1 1, with Robert 
Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and 
Fernand Leger, Metzinger 
participated in the controversial 
Salle 41 at the Salon des 
Independants, the first formal 
group exhibition of Cubist 
painters. His work was 
represented at the Salon 
d'Automne in Paris that same year. 
Metzinger collaborated with 
Gleizes in 19 12 on Dn cubisme, in 
which a theoretical foundation for 
Cubism was proposed. During 
that year he was a founder of the 
Section d'Or and exhibited at the 
Galerie de la Boetie in Paris with 
other members of the group, 
including Alexander Archipenko, 
Roger de La Fresnaye, Gleizes, 
Juan Gris, Leger, and Louis 
Marcoussis. In 191 3 Metzinger's 
work was again shown at the 
Salon d'Automne, and he 
continued to exhibit in the 
principal salons of Paris thereafter. 
This same year he took part in an 
exhibition at Der Sturm gallery in 
Berlin and shared a show at the 
Galerie Berthe Weill in Paris with 
Gleizes and Leger. In 19 16 
Metzinger showed with Jean 
Crotti, Marcel Duchamp, and 
Gleizes at the Montross Gallery in 
New York. After army service 
during World War I Metzinger 
returned in 1919 to Paris, where 
he lived for the remainder of his 
life. Among his solo exhibitions 
were those at the Leicester 
Galleries in London in 1930, the 
Hanover Gallery in London in 
1932, and the Arts Club of 
Chicago in 1955- The artist died 
in Paris on November 3, 1 956. 



JOAN MIRO 

1893-1983 

Joan Miro Ferra was born in 
Barcelona on April 20, 1 893. At 
the age of fourteen he went to 
business school 111 Barcelona Aud 
also attended La Lonja, the 
academy of fine arts in the same 
city. Upon completing three years 
of art studies he took a position as 
a clerk. After suffering a nervous 
breakdown he abandoned 



232 



business and resumed his art 
studies, attending Francesc Gall's 
Escola d'Art in Barcelona from 
1912 to 191 5. Miro received early 
encouragement from the dealer 
Jose Dalmau, who gave him his 
first solo show at his gallery in 
Barcelona in 1 9 1 8. In 1917 he met 
Francis Picabia. 

In 1 9 19 Miro made his first trip 
to Paris, where he met Pablo 
Picasso. From 1920 Miro divided 
his time between Paris and 
Montroig. In Paris he associated 
with the poets Max Jacob, Pierre 
Reverdy, and Tristan Tzara and 
participated in Dada activities. 
Dalmau organized Miro's first solo 
show in Paris, at the Galerie la 
Licorne in 19 2.1. His work was 
included in the Salon d'Automne 
of 1923. In 1924 Miro joined the 
Surrealist group. His solo show at 
the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925 
was a major Surrealist event; Mi 10 
was included in the first Surrealist 
exhibition at the Galerie Pierre 
that same year. He visited the 
Netherlands in 1928 and began a 
series of paintings inspired by 
Dutch masters. This year he also 
executed his first papiers colles 
and collages. In 1929 he started 
his experiments in lithography, 
and his first etchings date from 
1933. During the early 1930s he 
made Surrealist sculpture-objects 
incorporating painted stones and 
found objects. In 1936 Miro left 
Spain because of the Civil War; he 
returned in 1941. 

An important Miro 
retrospective was held at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New 
York in 1941. That year Miro 
began working in ceramics with 
Josep Llorens y Artigas and 
started to concentrate on prints; 
from 1954 to 1958 he worked 
almost exclusively in these two 
mediums. In 1958 Miro was given 
a Guggenheim International 
Award for murals for the unesco 
Building in Paris; the following 
year he resumed painting, 
initiating a series of mural-sized 
canvases. During the 1960s he 
began to work intensively in 
sculpture. A major Miro 
retrospective took place at the 
Grand Palais in Paris in 19-4. In 
1978 the Musee National dArt 
Moderne, Centre Georges 
Pompidou, Paris, exhibited over 
five hundred works in a major 



retrospective of his drawings. 
Miro died on December 25, 1983, 
in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. 



PIET MONDRIAN 

[872-1944 

Piet Mondrian was born Pieter 
Cornells Mondriaan, Jr., on 
March 7, 1872, in Amersfoort, the 
Netherlands. He studied at the 
Rijksakademie van Beeldende 
Kunsten, Amsterdam, from [892 
to 1897. Until 1908, when he 
began to take annual trips to 
Domburg in Zeeland, Mondrian's 
work was naturalistic — 
incorporating successive influences 
of academic landscape and still- 
life painting, Dutch 
Impressionism, and Symbolism. In 
1909 a major exhibition of his 
work (with that of Jan Sluyters 
and C. R. H. Spoor) was held at 
the Stedelijk Museum, 
Amsterdam, and that same year he 
joined the Theosophic Society. In 
1909 and 19 10 he experimented 
with Pointillism and by 191 1 had 
begun to work in a Cubist mode. 
After seeing original Cubist works 
by Georges Braque and Pablo 
Picasso at the first Modeme 
Kunstkring exhibition in 1911 in 
Amsterdam, Mondrian decided to 
move to Paris. In Paris from 19 12 
to 1 9 14 he began to develop an 
independent abstract style. 

Mondrian was visiting the 
Netherlands when World War I 
broke out and prevented his return 
to Paris. During the war years in 
Holland he further reduced his 
colors and geometric shapes and 
formulated his non-objective Neo- 
plastic style. In 191 7 Mondrian 
became one of the founders of De 
Stijl. This group, which included 
Theo van Doesburg and Georges 
Vantongerloo, extended its 
principles of abstraction and 
simplification beyond painting and 
sculpture to architecture and 
graphic and industrial design. 
Mondrian's essays on abstract art 
were published in the periodical 
De Stijl. In July 19 1 9 he returned 
to Pans; there he exhibited with 
De Stijl in 1923, but withdrew 
from the group after van 
Doesburg reintroduced diagonal 
elements into his work around 
1925. In 1930 Mondrian showed 
with Cercle et Carre (( irele and 



Square) and in 193 1 joined 
Abstraction-Creation. 

World War II forced Mondrian 
to move to London in i&lt;j}8 and 
then to settle 111 New York in 
October 1940. In New York he 
joined American Abstract Artists 
and continued to publish texts on 
Neo-Plasticism. His late style 
evolved significantly in response to 
the city. In 1942 his first solo show- 
took place at the Valentine 
Dudensing Gallery, New York. 
Mondrian died on February 1 , 
1944, in New York. In 19-1 the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
organized a centennial exhibition 
of his work. 



HENRY MOORE 

1 898-1986 

\ Lenrj Spencer Moore was born 
on July 30, 1898, in Castleford, 
Yorkshire. Despite an early desire 
to become a sculptor, Moore 
began his career as a teacher in 
Castleford. After military service 
in World War I he attended Leeds 
School of Art on an ex- 
serviceman's grant. In 1921 he 
won a Royal Exhibition 
Scholarship to study sculpture at 
the Royal Academy of Art in 
London. Moore became interested 
in the Mexican, Egyptian, and 
African sculpture he saw at the 
British Museum. He was 
appointed Instructor of Sculpture 
at the Royal Academy in 1924, a 
post he held for the next seven 
years. A Royal Academy traveling 
scholarship allowed Moore to visit 
Italy in 1925; there he saw the 
frescoes of Giotto and Masaccio 
and the late sculpture of 
Michelangelo. Moore's first solo 
show of sculpture was held at the 
Warren Gallery, London, in 1928. 

In the 1930s Moore was a 
member of Unit One, a group of 
advanced artists organized by Paul 
Nash, and was a close friend of 
Barbara Hepworth, Ben 
Nicholson, and the critic Herbert 
Read. From 1932 to 19^9 he 
taught at the Chelsea School of 
Art. He was an important force 
in the English Surrealist 
movement, although he was not 
entirely committed to its doctrines; 
Moore participated in the 
International Surrealist Exhibition 
at the New Burlington Galleries, 



233 



London, in 1936. In 1940 Moore 
was appointed an official war 
artist and was commissioned by 
the War Artists Advisor} 
Committee to execute drawings of 
life in underground bomb shelters. 
From 1 940 to 194} the artist 
concentrated almost entirely on 
drawing. His first retrospective 
took place at Temple Newsam, 
Leeds, in 1941. In 1943 he received 
a commission from the Church of 
St. Matthew, Northampton, to 
carve a Madonna and Child; this 
sculpture was the first in an 
important series of family-group 
sculptures. Moore was given his 
first major retrospective abroad by 
the Museum of Modern Art, 
New York, in 1946. He won the 
International Prize for Sculpture at 
the Venice Biennale of 1948. 

Moore executed several 
important public commissions in 
the 1950s, among them Reclining 
Figure, 1956-58, for the unesco 
Building in Paris. In 1963 the 
artist was awarded the British 
Order of Merit. In 1978 an 
exhibition of his work organized 
by the Arts Council of Great 
Britain was held at the Serpentine 
in London, at which time he gave 
many of his sculptures to the Tate 
Gallery, London. Moore died in 
Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, on 
August 31, 1986. 



ROBERT MOTHERWELL 

191 5- 1 99 1 

Robert Motherwell was born on 
January 4, 19 15, in Aberdeen, 
Washington. He was awarded a 
fellowship to the Otis Art Institute 
in Los Angeles at age eleven, and 
in 1932 studied painting briefly at 
the California School of Fine Arts 
in San Francisco. Motherwell 
received a B.A. from Stanford 
University in [937 and enrolled

presented at the Raymond Duncan 
Gallery in Paris in 1 9 59. 
In September of 1940 
Motherwell settled in New York 
( it\, w here lie entered Columbia 
I Iniversity to study art history 
with Meyer Schapiro, who 



encouraged him to become a 
painter. In 1941 Motherwell 
traveled to Mexico with Matta for 
six months. After returning to 
New York, his circle came to 
include William Baziotes, Willem 
de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, and 
Jackson Pollock. In 1942 
Motherwell was included in the 
exhibition First Papers of 
Surrealism at the Whitelaw Reid 
Mansion, New York. In i 944 
Motherwell became editor of the 
Documents of Modern Art series 
of books, and he contributed 
frequently to the literature on 
Modern art from that time. 

A solo exhibition of 
Motherwell's work was held at 
Art of This Century in 1944. In 
1946 he began to associate with

1910-1 1; between 1911 and 1914 
he traveled in France, Italy, and 
Spain. He lived briefly in 
Pasadena, California, in 19 17-18. 
His first solo show was held at the 
Adelphi Gallery in London in 
1922. Shortly thereafter he began 
abstract paintings influenced by 
Synthetic Cubism. By 1927 he had 
initiated a primitive style inspired 
by Henri Rousseau and early 
English folk art. 

From 1 93 1 Nicholson lived in 
London; his association with 
Barbara Hepworth and Henry 
Moore dates from this period. In 
1932 he and Hepworth visited 
Jean Arp, Constantin Brancusi, 
Georges Braque, and Pablo 
Picasso in France. Jean Helion and 
Auguste Herbin encouraged them 
to join Abstraction-Creation in

exhibition in Kassel, German}, 
and in 1968 was awarded the 
Order of Merit by Queen 
Elizabeth. The Albright-Knox 
Art Gallery, Buffalo, organized a 
retrospective of his work in 
1978. Ben Nicholson died on

AMEDEE OZENFANT 

[886-1966 

AmedeeJ. Ozenfant was born on 
April 1 5, 1886, in Saint-Quentin, 
Aisne, France. At age fourteen he 



234 



began painting, and in 1904 he 
attended the Ecole Municipale de 
Dessin Quentin-La Tour in Saint- 
Quentin. The following year he 
moved to Paris, where he entered 
an architecture studio. At this time 
he also studied painting with 
Charles Cottet at the Academic de 
la Palette, where he became a 
friend of Roger de La Fresnaye and 
Andre Dunoyer de Segonzac. 

Ozenfant's first solo exhibition 
was held in 1908 at the Salon de la 
Nationale in Paris. In 19 10 he 
contributed works to the Salon 
d'Automne and in 191 1 he

Independants. From about 1909 to 
1915 he made trips to Russia, Italy, 
Belgium, and the Netherlands and 
attended lectures at the College 
de France in Paris. In 191 5 
Ozenfant founded the magazine 
L'Elan, which he edited until 19 17, 
and began to formulate his 
theories of Purism. In 1917 the 
artist met the Swiss architect and 
painter Charles-Edouard Jeanneret 
(Le Corbusier); together they 
articulated the doctrines of Purism 
in their book Apres le cubisme. Its 
publication coincided with the first 
Purist exhibition, held at the 
Galerie Thomas in Paris in 19 17, 
in which Ozenfant was 
represented. Ozenfant and Le 
Corbusier collaborated on the 
journal L'Esprit nouveau, which

ANTOINE PEVSNER 

[884-1962 

Antoine Pevsner was born on 
January 18, 1884, in Orel, Russia. 
After leaving the Academy of Fine 
Arts in St. Petersburg in 191 1, he 
traveled to Pans where he saw the 
work of Robert Delaunay, Albert 
Gleizes, Fernand Leger, and Jean 
Metzinger. On a second visit to 
Paris in 1 9 1 3 he met Amedeo 
Modigliani and Alexander 
Archipenko, who encouraged his 
interest in Cubism. Pevsner spent 
the war years 1 9 1 5-1 7 in Oslo 
with his brother Naum Gabo. On 
his return to Russia in 191 7 
Pevsner began teaching at the 
Moscow Academy of Fine Arts 
with Vasily Kandinsky and 
Kazimir Malevich. 

In 1920 he and Gabo published 
the Realistic Manifesto. Their 
work was included in the Erste 
russische Kunstausstellung at the 
Galerie van Diemen in Berlin in 
1922, held under the auspices of 
the Soviet government. The 
following year Pevsner visited 
Berlin, where he met Marcel 
Duchamp and Katherine Dreier. 
He then traveled on to Paris, where 
he settled permanently; in 1930 he 
became a French citizen. His work 
was included in an exhibition at 
the Little Review Gallery in New 
York in 1926. He and Gabo 
designed sets for the ballet La 
Chatte, produced by Sergei 
Diaghilev in 1927. In Paris the two 
brothers were leaders of the 
Constructivist members of 
Abstraction-Creation, an alliance 
of artists who embraced a variety 
of abstract styles. 

During the 1930s Pevsner's 
work was shown in Amsterdam, 
Basel, London, New York, and 
Chicago. In 1946 he, Gleizes, 
Auguste Herbin, and others 
formed the group Realites

1958 he was represented in the 
French Pavilion at the Venice 
Biennale. Pevsner died 111 Paris on 
April 12, 1962. 



FRANCIS PICABIA 
1879-1953 

Francois Marie Martinez Picabia 
was born on or about January 22, 
1879, in Paris, of a Spanish father 
and a French mother. He was 
enrolled at the Ecole des Arts 
Decoratifs in Paris from 1895 to 
1897 and later studied with 
Fernand Cormon, Ferdinand 
Humbert, and Albert Charles 
Wallet. He began to paint in an 
Impressionist manner in the winter 
of 1902-03 and started to exhibit 
works in this style at the Salon 
d'Automne and the Salon des 
Independants of 1903. His first 
solo show was held at the Galerie 
Haussmann, Paris, in 1905. From 
1908 elements of Fauvism and 
NeoTmpressionism as well as 
Cubism and other forms of 
abstraction appeared in his 
painting, and by 1912 he had 
evolved a personal amalgam of 
Cubism and Fauvism. Picabia 
worked in an abstract mode from 
this period until the early 1920s. 

Picabia became a friend of 
Guillaume Apollinaire and Marcel 
Duchamp and associated with the 
Puteaux group in 191 1 and 19 1 2. 
He participated in the 1 9 1 3 
Armory Show-, visiting New York 
on this occasion and frequenting 
avant-garde circles. Alfred Stieglitz 
gave him a solo exhibition at his 
gallery "29 1 " that same year. In 
1915, which marked the beginning 
of Picabia's machinist or 
mechanomorphic period, he and 
Duchamp, among others, 
instigated and participated in Dada 
manifestations in New York. 
Picabia lived in Barcelona in 1916 
and 1 9 1 7; in 1 9 1 ~ he published his 



^35 



first volume of poetry and the first 
issues of 391, his magazine 
modeled after Stieglitz's periodical 
191. For the next few years 
Picabia remained involved with 
the Dadaists in Zurich and Paris, 
creating scandals at the Salon 
d'Automne, but finally denounced 
Dada in 1921 for no longer being 
"new." He moved to Tremblay- 
sur-Mauldre, outside of Paris, the 
following year and returned to 
figurative art. In 1924 he attacked 
Andre Breton and the Surrealists 
in 391. 

Picabia moved to Mougins in 
1925. During the 1930s he 
became a close friend of Gertrude 
Stein. By the end of World War II 
Picabia returned to Paris. He 
resumed painting in an abstract 
style and writing poetry. In March 
1949 a retrospective of his work 
was held at the Galerie Rene 
Drouin in Paris. Picabia died in 
Paris on November 30, 1953. 



PABLO PICASSO 

1881-1973 

Pablo Ruiz y Picasso was born on 
October 25, 1881, in Malaga, 
Spain. The son of an academic 
painter, Jose Ruiz Blanco, he 
began to draw at an early age. In 
1895 the family moved to 
Barcelona, and Picasso studied 
there at La Lonja, the academy of 
fine arts. His visit to Horta de 
Ebro from 1898 to 1899 and his 
association with the group at the 
cafe Els Quatre Gats about 1899 
were crucial to his early artistic 
development. In 1900 Picasso's 
first exhibition took place in 
Barcelona, and that fall he went 
to Paris for the first of several 
stays during the early years of the 
century. Picasso settled in Paris in 
April 1904 and soon his circle of 
friends included Guillaume 
Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Gertrude 
and Leo Stein, as well as two 
dealers, Ambroise Vollard and 
Berthe Weill. 

His style developed from the 
Blue Period ( 1901-04) to the Rose 
Period (1905) to the pivotal work 
Les Demoiselles d' Avignon, 1907, 
and the subsequent evolution of 
Cubism from 1909 into 191 1. 
Picasso's collaboration on ballet 
and theatrical productions began 
in 1916. Soon thereafter Ins work 



was characterized by 
neoclassicism and a renewed 
interest in drawing and figural 
representation. In the 1920s the 
artist and his wife Olga (whom he 
had married in 1918) continued to 
live in Paris, to travel frequently, 
and to spend their summers at the 
beach. From 1925 into the 1930s 
Picasso was involved to a certain 
degree with the Surrealists and 
from the fall of 193 1 he was 
especially interested in making 
sculpture. With large exhibitions 
at the Galeries Georges Petit in 
Paris and the Kunsthaus Zurich in 
1932 and the publication of the 
first volume of Christian Zervos's 
catalogue raisonne the same year, 
Picasso's fame increased markedly. 
By 1936 the Spanish Civil War 
had profoundly affected Picasso, 
the expression of which 
culminated in his painting 
Guernica, 1937. Picasso's 
association with the Communist 
party began in 1944. From the 
late 1940s he lived in the south of 
France. Among the enormous 
number of Picasso exhibitions 
that were held during the artist's 
lifetime, those at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York in 1939 
and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs 
in Paris in 1955 were most 
significant. In 1961 the artist 
married Jacqueline Roque, and 
they moved to Mougins. There 
Picasso continued his prolific 
work in painting, drawing, prints, 
ceramics, and sculpture until his 
death on April 8, 1973. 



JACKSON POLLOCK 

1912-1956 

Paul Jackson Pollock was born 
January 28, 19 12, in Cody, 
Wyoming. He grew up in Arizona 
and California and in 1928 began 
to study painting at the Manual 
Arts High School in Los Angeles. 
In the fall of 1930 Pollock came to 
New York and studied under 
Thomas Hart Benton at the Art 
Students League. Benton 
encouraged him throughout the 
succeeding decade. By the early 
1930s Pollock knew and admired 
the murals of Jose Clemente 
Orozco and Diego Rivera. 
Although he traveled widely 
throughout the United States 
during the 1 9}os, much of 



Pollock's time was spent in New 
York, where he settled 
permanently in 1935 and worked 
on the WPA Federal Art Project 
from 1935 to 1942. In 1936 he 
worked in David Alfaro 
Siqueiros's experimental 
workshop in New York. 

Pollock's first solo show was 
held at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of 
This Century gallery in New York 
in 1943. Guggenheim gave him a 
contract that lasted through 1947, 
permitting him to devote all his 
time to painting. Prior to 1947 
Pollock's work reflected the 
influence of Picasso and 
Surrealism. During the early 
1940s he contributed paintings to 
several exhibitions of Surrealist 
and abstract art, including 
Natural, Insane, Surrealist Art at 
Art of This Century in 1943, ar *d 
Abstract and Surrealist Art in 
America, organized by Sidney 
Janis at the Mortimer Brandt 
Gallery in New York in 1944. 

From the fall of 1945, when 
Lee Krasner and Pollock were 
married, they lived in the Springs, 
East Hampton. In 1952 Pollock's 
first solo show in Paris opened at 
the Studio Paul Facchetti and his 
first retrospective was organized 
by Clement Greenberg at 
Bennington College in Vermont. 
He was included in many group 
exhibitions, including the annuals 
at the Whitney Museum of 
American Art, New York, from 
1946 and the Venice Biennale in 
1950. Although his work was 
widely known and exhibited 
internationally, the artist never 
traveled outside the United States. 
He was killed in an automobile 
accident on August 11, 1956, in 
the Springs.

1887-1948 

Herman Edward Karl Julius 
Schwitters was born in Hannover 
on June 20, 1887. He attended the 
Kunstgewerbeschule in Hannover 
from 1908 to 1909 and from 
1909 to 1914 studied at the 
Kunstakademie Dresden. After 
serving as a draftsman in the 
military in 1917, Schwitters 
experimented with Cubist and 
Expressionist styles. In 19 18 he 
made his first collages and in 
191 9 invented the term "Merz," 
which he was to apply to all his 
creative activities: poetry as well 
as collage and constructions. This 
year also marked the beginning of 
his friendships with Jean Arp and 
Raoul Hausmann. Schwitters's 
earliest Merzbilder date from 
1919, the year of his first 
exhibition at Der Sturm gallery, 
Berlin, and the first publication of 
his writings in the periodical 
Der Sturm. Schwitters showed at 
the Societe Anonyme in New York 
in 1920. 

With Arp he attended the 
Kongress der Konstructwistcu in 
Weimar in 1922. There Schwitters 
met Theo van Doesburg, whose De 
Stijl principles influenced his work. 
Schwitters's Dada activities 
included his Merz-Matineen and 
Merz-Abende at which he 
presented his poetry. From 192} to 
1932 he published the magazine 
Merz. About 1923 the artist 
started to make his first Merzbau, a 
fantastic structure he built over a 
number of years; the Merzbau 
grew to occupy much of his 
Hannover studio. During this 
period he also worked in 
typography. Schwitters was 
included in the exhibition 
Abstrakte mid surrealistische 
Malerei mid Plastik at the 
Kunsthaus Zurich in 1 929. The 
artist contributed to the Parisian 



review Cercle et Carre in 1 930; in 
1932 he joined the Paris-based 
Abstraction-Creation group and 
wrote for their organ of the same 
name. He participated in the 
Cubism and Abstract Art and 
Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism 
exhibitions of 1936 at the Museum 
of Modern Art, New York. 

The Nazi regime banned 
Schwitters's work as "degenerate 
art" in 1937. This year the artist 
fled to Lysaker, Norway, where he 
constructed a second Merzbau. 
After the German invasion of 
Norway in 1940, Schwitters 
escaped to Great Britain, where he 
was interned for over a year. He 
settled in London following his 
release, but moved to Little 
Langdale in the Lake District in 
1945. There, helped by a stipend 
from the Museum of Modern Art, 
he began work on a third 
Merzbau in 1947. The project was 
left unfinished when Schwitters 
died on January 8, 1948, in 
Kendal, England. 



GINO SEVERINI 

1883-1966 

Gino Severini was born on 
April 7, 1883, in Cortona, Italy. 
He studied at the Scuola Tecnica 
in Cortona before moving to 
Rome in 1899. There he attended 
art classes at the Villa Medici and 
by 1 90 1 met Umberto Boccioni, 
who had also recently arrived in 
Rome and later would be one of 
the theoreticians of Futurism. 
Together Severini and Boccioni 
visited the studio of Giacomo 
Balla where they were introduced 
to painting with "divided" rather 
than mixed color. After settling in 
Paris in November 1906, Severini 
studied Impressionist painting and 
met the Neo-Impressionist Paul 
Signac. 

Severini soon came to know 
most of the Parisian avant-garde, 
including Georges Braque, Juan 
(iris, Amedeo Modigliani, and 
Pablo Picasso, Lugne-Poe and his 
theatrical circle, the poets 
Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Fort, 
and Max Jacob, and author Jules 
Romains. After joining the 
Futurist movement at the 
invitation ot Filippo Tommaso 
Marinetti ,\n&lt;\ boccioni, Severini 
signed the Manifesto tecnico delta 



238 



pittum futurista of April 1910, 
along with Balla, Boccioni, Carlo 
Carra, and Luigi Russolo. 
However, Severini was less 
attracted to the subject of the 
machine than his fellow Futurists 
and frequently chose the form of 
the dancer to express Futurist 
theories of dynamism in art. 

Severini helped organize the 
first Futurist exhibition at 
Bernheim-Jeune, Pans, m 
February 191 2, and participated 
in subsequent Futurist shows m 
Europe and the United States. In 
191 3 he had solo exhibitions at 
the Marlborough Gallery, 
London, and Der Sturm, Berlin. 
During the Futurist period 
Severini acted as an important 
link between artists in France and 
Italy. After his last truly Futurist 
works — a series of paintings on 
war themes — Severini painted in a 
Synthetic Cubist mode, and by 
1920 he was applying theories of 
classical balance based on the 
Golden Section to figurative 
subjects from the traditional 
commedia dell'arte. He divided 
his time between Paris and Rome 
after 1920. He explored fresco 
and mosaic techniques and 
executed murals in various 
mediums in Switzerland, France, 
and Italy during the 1920s. In the 
1950s he returned to the subjects 
of his Futurist years: dancers, 
light, and movement. Throughout 
his career Severini published 
important theoretical essays and 
books on art. Severini died in 
Paris on February 26, 1966.

the international avant-garde. He 
participated in an exhibition of 
abstract Italian art at the Galleria

YVES TANGUY 

1900-195 5 

Raymond Georges Yves Tanguy 
was born on January 5, 1900, in 
Paris. While attending lycee during 
the 1 9 1 os, he met Pierre Matisse, 
his future dealer and lifelong 
friend. In 191 8 he joined the 
Merchant Marine and traveled to 
Africa, South America, and 
England. During military service 
at Luneville in 1920, Tanguy 
became a friend of the poet 
Jacques Prevert. He returned to 
Paris in 1922 after volunteer 
service in Tunis and began 
sketching cafe scenes that were 
praised by Maurice de Vlaminck. 
After Tanguy saw Giorgio de 
Chirico's work in 1923, he 
decided to become a painter. In 
1924, he, Prevert, and Marcel 
Duhamel moved into a house that 
was to become a gathering place 
for the Surrealists. Tanguy became 
interested in Surrealism in 1924, 
when he saw the periodical La 
Revolution surrealiste. Andre 
Breton welcomed him into the 
Surrealist group the following year. 

Despite his lack of formal 
training, Tanguy's art developed 
quickly and his mature style 
emerged by 1927. His first solo 
show was held in 1927 at the 
Galerie Surrealiste in Paris. In 
1928 he participated with Jean 
Arp, Max Ernst, Andre Masson, 
Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, and 
others in the Surrealist exhibition 
at the Galerie au Sacre du 
Printemps, Paris. Tanguy 
incorporated into his work the 
images of geological formations 
he had observed during a trip to 
Africa in 1930. He exhibited 
extensively during the 1930s in 
solo and Surrealist group shows 
in New York, Brussels, Paris, and 
London. 

In 19^9 Tanguy met the 
painter Kay Sage in Paris and 
later that year traveled with her 
to the American Southwest. They 
married in 1940 and settled in 
Woodbury, Connecticut. In 1942 
Tanguy participated in the Artists 
in Exile show at the Pierre 
Matisse Gallery in New York, 
where he exhibited frequently 
until 1950. In 1947 his work was 
included in the exhibition I e 
Surrealisme en '94-, organized 
In Breton and Marcel Duchamp 



at the Galerie Maeght in Paris. He 
became a United States citizen in 
1948. In 1953 he visited Rome, 
Milan, and Paris on the occasion 
of his solo shows in those cities. 
The following year he shared an 
exhibition with Kay Sage at the 
Wadsworth Atheneum in 
Hartford and appeared in Hans 
Riehter's film 8 x 8. A 
retrospective of Tanguy's work 
was held at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York eight 
months after his death on 
January 15, 1955, in Woodbury. 



THEO VAN DOESBURG 

1883-193 1 

Christian Emil Marie Kiipper, 
who adopted the pseudonym 
Theo van Doesburg, was born in 
Utrecht, the Netherlands, on 
August 30, 1883. His first 
exhibition of paintings was held 
in 1908 in the Hague. In the early 
1910s he wrote poetry and 
established himself as an art 
critic. From 1914 to 1916 van 
Doesburg served in the Dutch 
army, after which time he settled 
in Leiden and began his 
collaboration with the architects 
J. J. P. Oud and Jan Wils. In 1917 
they founded the group De Stijl 
and the periodical of the same 
name; other original members 
were Vilmos Huszar, Piet 
Mondrian, Bart van der Leek, and 
Georges Vantongerloo. Van 
Doesburg executed decorations 
for Oud's De Vonk project in 
Noordwijkerhout in 1917. 
In 1920 he resumed his 
writing, using the pen name 
I. K. Bonset and later Aldo 
Camini. Van Doesburg visited 
Berlin and Weimar in 1921 and 
the following year taught at the 
Weimar Bauhaus, where he 
associated with Raoul Hausmann, 
I e Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van 
der Rohe, and Hans Richter. He 
was interested in Dada at this 
time and worked with Kurt 
Schwitters as well as Jean Arp, 
Tristan Tzara, and others on the 
review Mecano in 1922. 
Exhibitions of the architectural 
designs of Gerrit Rietveld, \^\n 
Doesburg, and Cor van Eesteren 
were held in Paris in 192} at 
I eonce Rosenberg's Galerie 
['Effort Moderne and in 1924 at 



240 



the Ecole Speciale d' Architecture. 

The Landesmuseum of Weimar 
presented a solo show of van 
Doesburg's work in 1924. That 
same year he lectured on modern 
literature in Prague, Vienna, and 
Hannover, and the Bauhaus 
published his Grundbegriffe der 
neuen gestaltenden Kunsi 
(Principles of Neo-Plastic Art). 
A new phase of De Stijl was 
declared by van Doesburg 111 his 
manifesto of "Elementarism," 
published in 1926. During that 
year he collaborated with Arp and 
Sophie Taeuber-Arp on the 
decoration of the restaurant- 
cabaret L'Aubette in Strasbourg. 
Van Doesburg returned to Paris in 
1929 and began working on a 
house at Meudon-Val-Fleury with 
van Eesteren. Also in that year he 
published the first issue of Art 
concret, the organ of the Paris- 
based group of the same name. 
Van Doesburg was the moving 
force behind the formation of the 
group Abstraction-Creation in 
Paris. The artist died on March 7, 
193 1, in Davos, Switzerland. 



GEORGES VANTONGERLOO 

1 886-1965 

Georges Vantongerloo was born 
on November 24, 1886, in 
Antwerp. He studied about 1900 
at the Aeademie des Beaux-Arts of 
Antwerp and of Brussels. He 
spent the years 19 14-18 in the 
Netherlands, where his work 
attracted the attention of the 
queen. While working on 
architectural designs there, 
Vantongerloo met Piet Mondrian, 
Bart van der Leek, and Theo van 
Doesburg and collaborated with 
them on the magazine De Stijl, 
which was founded in 19 17. Soon 
after his return to Brussels in 
1918 he moved to Menton, 
France. In France he developed a 
close friendship with the artist 
and architect Max Bill, who was 
to organize many Vantongerloo 
exhibitions. In 1924 Vantongerloo 
published his pamphlet "L'Art et 
son avenir" in Antwerp. 

In 1928 the artist-architect- 
theorist moved from Menton to 
Paris; there in 1 93 1 he became 
vice-president of the artists' 
association Abstraction-Creation, 
a position he held until l^r. His 



models of bridges and a proposed 
airport were exhibited at the 
\ hi see des Arts Decoratifs in Paris 
in 1930. In 193d he participated in 
the exhibition Cubism and 
Abstract Art at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York. His first 
solo show was held at the Galerie 
de Berri in Paris in 1943. 
Vantongerloo shared an exhibition 
with Max Bill and Antoine 
Pevsner in 1949 at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich. His seventy-fifth birthday 
was observed with a solo 
exhibition at the Galerie Suzanne 
Bollag in Zurich in 1961. The 
following year Bill organized a 
large Vantongerloo retrospective 
for the Marlborough New London 
Gallery in London. Vantongerloo 
died on October 5, 1965, in Paris. 



EMILIO VEDOVA 

b. 1919 

Emilio Vedova was born on 
August 9, 1 9 19, in Venice. He is 
essentially self-taught as an artist. 
About 1942 he joined the 
Milanese artists' association 
Corrente, which also included 
Renato Birolli, Renato Guttuso, 
Ennio Morlotti, and Umberto 
Vittorini. Vedova participated in 
the Resistance movement from 
1943-45. I" T 94 6 he collaborated 
with Morlotti on the manifesto 
Oltre (iiienncj in Milan and 
was a founding member of the 
Fronte Nuovo delle Arti in Venice. 
He describes his paintings of 
this period, 1946-50, as 
Geometrie nere. 

Vedova's first solo show in the 
United States was held at the 
Catherine Viviano Gallery in New 
York in 1951. In the same year he 
was awarded the prize for young 
painters at the first Sao Paulo 
Bienal. In 1952 he participated in 
the Gruppo degli Otto, organized 
by Lionello Venturi. Vedova was 
represented at the first Documenta 
exhibition in Kassel in 1955 and 
won a Guggenheim International 
Award in 1956. He executed his 
first lithographs in 1958, the year 
he went to Poland on the occasion 
of his retrospective at the 
Muzeum Narodowe in Poznari 
and the "Zacheta" in Warsaw. In 
1959 he created large L-shaped 
canvases, called Scontri di 
situazioni, which were exhibited 



in an environment created h\ 
Carlo Scarpa for the exhibition 
Vitalita nell'arte, which opened at 
Palazzo Grassi, Venice, and 
traveled to the Stedelijk Museum, 
Amsterdam. This led to the first 
l'liinnn in [961—63: free-standing, 
hinged, and painted sculpture/ 
paintings made of wood and metal. 

Vedova was awarded the 
Grand Prize for Painting at the 
i960 Venice Biennale, the year in 
which he created moving light sets 
and costumes for Luigi Nono's 
opera Intolleranza '6o. From [963 
to 1965, Vedova worked in Berlin, 
at the Deutsche Akademischer 
Austausch Dienst, and created his 
best known Plurimi, the Absurdes 
Berliner Tagebuch, seven of which 
were presented at Documenta III, 
Kassel. From 1965 to 1969 (and 
in 1988), he succeeded Oskar 
Kokoschka as Director of the 
Internationale Sommerakademie 
in Sal/burg. In 1965 and 1983 he 
traveled in the United States, 
where he lectured extensively. For 
the Italian Pavilion at Expo '6j, 
Montreal, he created a light- 
collage using glass plates to 
project mobile images across a 
large asymmetric space. Vedova 
taught at the Accademia di Belle 
Arti, Venice, from 1975 to 1986. 
Since the late 1970s, he has 
experimented with a variety of 
new techniques and formats such 
as the Plurimi-Binari (mobile 
works on steel rails), monotypes, 
double-sided circular panels 
(Dischi), and large-scale glass 
engraving. In 1995 he began a 
new scries of multifaceted and 
manipulable painted objects called 
Disco-Plurimo.
