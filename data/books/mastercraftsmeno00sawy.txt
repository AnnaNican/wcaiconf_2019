ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 



The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ordinarily chooses to 
devote its exhibition and publication program to painting and 
sculpture of the modern era, a designation intended to comprise 
the last hundred years, from the emergence of Impressionism to 
our time. MASTERCRAFTSMEN OF ANCIENT PERU as here pre- 
sented is, therefore, an innovation as well as an experiment which 
the Foundation's Trustees approved as a possible precursor to 
other exhibitions surveying the creative richess of a particular, 
now historic, civilization. Peru seemed a promising subject to 
begin such visual inquiries, for its many levelled Pre-Columbian 
cultures, stretching partly in chronological, partly overlapping 
sequences through centuries, are mirrored in objects which 
become, simultaneously, carriers of a great episode in the civili- 
zation of mankind and an autonomous achievement speaking 
through its perfection to modern sensibilities. 
For the purposes of the current exhibition project, more than 600 
objects, large and small, representational and decorative, func- 
tional and symbolic, in stone, wood, metal, clay and in fabric, 
have been assembled from divergent sources to constitute the 
most comprehensive such view of Peru's collective genius ever 
attempted. An exhibition of such scope is always an undertaking 
that depends upon the generous participation of many, variously 
qualified individuals. This is even more true with a subject that 
lies beyond the Museum's curatorial competence and of a project 
that required years of search and preparation in distant parts of 
the world, outside the bounds and conventions of a familiar art 
world. Thus, to a more exclusive degree than with subjects more 
familiar to us, the curatorial responsibility for this exhibition was 
placed in the hands of a specialist in the field. Dr. Alan Sawyer, 
Director of The Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. and Peru- 
vian scholar, was one of the few individuals to whom this show 
and its accompanying catalogue could be safely entrusted, and 
who therefore was appointed curator of the exhibition. 
Dr. Sawyer, on his frequent journeys through the Peruvian lands 
was accompanied by staff members of the Guggenheim Museum, 
partly to assist with the securing of loans, but chiefly to inject 
the Museum's presence in the inevitably complex and highly 
responsible negotiations with lenders, museums, and government 
officials, who in concert with the curator of the exhibition and 
with our administrative staff gradually cleared the formidable 
obstacles to the project. Special thanks are due to Everett Ellin, 
formerly Assistant to the Director, and to Orrin H. Riley, Con- 
servator, who during the past three years spelled each other in 
the completion of this task. Mr. Riley, in addition, must be 
credited with having devised methods through which the safe 
transfer of objects could be assured, first from the far reaches 
of Peru to a central gathering point in Lima, and eventually from 
the Peruvian capital to New York City. The last phase of Mr. 
Riley's contribution is the installation on the ramps of the Frank 
Lloyd Wright building which through its ready adaptation to yet 
another untried exhibition type proved again its great versatility 
under conditions of competent planning and execution. 
It would have been more convenient to rely on sources of easy 
access, but it was decided in the initial exhibition phases, to avoid 



expedients so as to arrive at an exhibition based almost wholly 
upon material previously unseen in this country. The lending 
burden, therefore, rested heavily upon the country of origin where 
twenty-five private individuals and seven National Museums, in 
full awareness of the cultural significance of this event, went far 
beyond the bounds of normal participation, as they decided to 
part for more than standard exhibition time with objects of un- 
common rarity and beauty. 

Even so, there is reason to doubt, that MASTERCRAFTSMEN OF 
ANCIENT PERU could have been presented at the Guggenheim 
Museum, had it not been possible to count on the most consistent 
and effective support from the highest authorities in the country 
of origin. We are greatly indebted to His Excellency, President 
Fernando Belaunde Terry and His Excellency, Ambassador Celso 
Pastor de la Torre for their unfailing support throughout the four 
years during which this exhibition has been in preparation. 
Others in both Peru and the United States made, at various times, 
decisive contributions towards the success of the exhibition. Not 
to exceed the format of this brief roster of acknowledgements 
their part must be mentioned in much abbreviated fashion 
although not without sincere gratitude for invaluable services 
rendered. Among Lima citizens ever ready to furnish needed 
guidance and assistance, were in particular Walter Gross, Alex 
Ciurlizza and other members of the Institute of Contemporary Art, 
Manuel Checa Solari, Carmen Gonzales, Elena Gaffron, Juana 
True!, Gene Savoy, Pedro Rojas Ponce and Gonzalo del Solar. 
Mr. Ciurlizza and Manual Ulloa took an active part in obtain- 
ing, through private subscription funds, a scholarship enabling a 
Peruvian student to join the project here and thereby derive 
useful instruction in Museum methods eventually to be applied 
in his own country. 

William Kaplan offered many hours of his time and skill to aid 
the Guggenheim Museum in the preparation of the works for 
exhibition. 

I wish to acknowledge gratefully financial contributions made in 
the form of free and reduced services by the Official Tourist 
Bureau, Grace Lines, Braniff International Airlines, Eastern Air- 
lines, Faucett Airlines, The Hotel Crillon, and Ford Motor Com- 
pany. We are also appreciative of the care and efficiency of the 
Peruvian investigation police in safeguarding the loans during 
their assembly. 

A few desired loans could not be negotiated in Peru and thanks 
are due to eight anonymous private collectors of the United 
States, Brazil and Argentina together with the American Museum 
of Natural History in New York, The Art Institute of Chicago and 
The Textile Museum of Washington, D.C. for select supplemen- 
tary loans. 

It would be unjust not to mention in closing the quietly effective 
part played by all Museum Departments in the staging of 
MASTERCRAFTSMEN OF ANCIENT PERU, an exhibition that 
will, within our ranks, be long remembered as one of the most 
exacting and rewarding ever presented.

INTRODUCTION 



The Spanish conquistadors of the early 16th Century were tough, 
determined, and resourceful men, stripped of tolerance and com- 
passion by the Inquisition and hardened by Spain's bitter struggle 
to drive the Moslems from their homeland. They were fired by the 
adventurer's lust for easy riches and had but slight awareness of 
the great intellectual and artistic achievements of the civilizations 
they destroyed. Beautifully wrought ritual objects of gold and 
silver were melted down. Exquisitely woven textiles and beauti- 
fully fashioned objects of ceramic and other materials were cast 
aside as worthless or destroyed in iconoclastic zeal. 
After the splendid kingdoms of Mexico and Central America had 
been sacked in rapid succession, enriching the participants 
beyond imagination and sending a steady stream of treasure back 
to mother Spain, those who had not yet made their fortunes turned 
southward to the fabled realm of the Incas. The conquest of Peru 
was swift and final. In 1532 Francisco Pizarro landed at Tumbes, 
just south of the present Ecuadorian border, with less than 200 
followers. Within a few months he had captured the Inca Ata- 
hualpa by treachery, exacted a huge ransom, and put him to 
death. Then, reinforced by 150 men under Diego de Almagro, he 
quickly routed the native armies, disorganized by the loss of their 
absolute ruler, and methodically set about looting the great cities 
of the Inca Empire. By 1536 the last organized resistance was 
crushed. In the fighting among the victors over the spoils both 
Almagro and Pizarro met death. 

Throughout the Colonial period that followed, the treasure hunt 
went on. The land was divided among the victors and favorites of 
the Spanish crown while the population was forced to work the 
mines and ransack the temples and cemeteries of their ancestors 
for precious metals. Attempts by the crown to lay claim to the 
treasure were largely ignored as were its administrative reforms 
aimed at protecting the Indians. In 1 780 a widespread insurrection 
led by Tupac Amaru II was brutally suppressed. In 1820 Peru 
joined its neighboring South American colonies in a successful 
revolt against Spain, leaving the country solidly under the control 
of the landowners. 

Meanwhile, in Europe and North America the end of the 18th 
Century saw a great reawakening of interest in antiquity stimu- 
lated by Winckelmann's discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii 
and the archeological plunder brought back by Napoleon's sol- 
diers after their invasion of Egypt. Inevitably this new wave of 
interest spread to the long overlooked ancient civilizations of 
the Americas. 

John Lloyd Stethens and Frederick Catherwood began their trail 
blazing explorations of Maya ruins in 1839. The sensation created 
by the publication of their Incidents of Travel in Yucatan was 
closely followed by that stirred by William H. Prescott's thorough- 
ly researched and eminently readable The Conquest of Mexico. 
In 1847 his equally remarkable The Conquest of Peru appeared, 
focusing public attention for the first time in three centuries on 
the ancient heritage of that remote and almost forgotten land. 
In 1 863 the famed pioneer American archeologist Ephriam George 
Squier arrived in Peru and for 3 years traveled throughout the 
coast and highlands filling notebooks with accurate observations 



and detailed plans of ancient ruins. His profusely illustrated 
account, Peru; Incidents of Travel and Exploration in the Land of 
the Incas, published in 1877, laid the cornerstone of Peruvian 
archeology. 

The interest and involvement of the scholarly community in 
ancient Peruvian studies gradually increased during the remainder 
of the 19th Century. It culminated in the extensive excavations 
conducted by Max Uhle in the 1890's and the early years of this 
century, for various American institutions. In addition to materials 
brought back by archeologists, large collections of Peruvian antiq- 
uities that had been gathered by hacienda owners, foreign 
residents, and travelers, found their way into European and 
American museums. 

In 1911 Hiram Bingham startled the world with his discovery of 
Machu Picchu. Two years later the Peruvian government estab- 
lished its National Museum of Anthropology and Archeology 
under the directorship of Dr. Julio C. Tello. The appearance of 
this dedicated and gifted man on the Peruvian archeological scene 
could not have been more timely. With extraordinary energy he 
conducted reconnaissance and excavation of ancient sites 
throughout the length and breadth of Peru and assembled at the 
National Museum the largest and most comprehensive collection 
of Peruvian antiquities in the world. His sensational discoveries 
stimulated an ever-increasing number of Peruvian and foreign 
archeologists to turn their talents and energies toward unveiling 
the mysteries of Peru's past. After his death in 1947 his spirit 
continued to be a primary source of inspiration to those who 
followed in his footsteps. 

The role that the private collector has played in Peruvian art and 
archeology cannot be minimized. Almost invariably he has freely 
shared his collection and his knowledge with the archeologist 
and art historian and in some cases has developed outstanding 
scholarship in his own right. This was particularly true of Don 
Rafael Larco Hoyle, founder of the Larco Herrera Museum, whose 
contribution to our knowledge of Peruvian prehistory ranks 
second only to that of Dr. Tello, Most Peruvian collectors have 
been closely associated with the land from which their collections 
derived. Their interest has tended to be strongly antiquarian 
though they were also moved by the esthetic qualities of their 
possessions. In recent years their ranks have been joined by an 
increasing number of art-oriented collectors located principally 
in Lima. Together they hold an important segment of the nation's 
historic treasure. 

With the advent of the collector in the 19th Century, a new 
profession was created, that of the "huaquero" or pot hunter. He 
was a direct descendant of the colonial laborer used by the land- 
owner in his search of precious metals. Now he was employed in 
the systematic looting of ancient cemeteries not only for objects 
of gold and silver, which had come to be worth more as art than 
as precious metal, but for pottery, textiles and other artifacts. As 
the demand increased, greater profits were to be realized and the 
huaqueros soon began digging clandestinely on their own. A new 
wave of pillage spread across the land compounding the damage 
to ancient sites wrought by colonial treasure hunters. 



In their hasty probing for saleable objects, the huaqueros not only 
destroyed or seriously damaged fragile materials but Irrevocably 
lost information important to the scholar such as association and 
provenience. Tello had the practice outlawed In 1930 but It has 
been difficult to control, especially In sparsely populated rural 
areas. The problem resembles that of the sorcerer's apprentice. 
Today the looting still goes on, aided and abetted by public 
Indifference, a rising art market, and the depressed economic 
status of the lower class. "Huaqueando" is about the only means 
Its members have of breaking the grip of poverty. It is a sad fact 
that, In spite of the dedicated efforts of many archeologlsts, the 
majority of ancient Peruvian art objects In public and private col- 
lections of the world today derived from huaquero activity. 
As the twentieth century has progressed, there has been an 
ever-Increasing awareness of the artistic as well as the archeo- 
loglcal aspects of Peruvian antiquities. Because of the relative 
inaccessibility of Peru before the advent of air travel, however, 
world recognition of the art of ancient Peru has tended to lag 
somewhat behind that of Mexico and Central America. It was not 
until the 1950's that It began to be given Its rightful place In art 
museums beside objects representing other great art traditions. 
In 1952 The Art Institute of Chicago placed on exhibition the 
famous collection of Dr. Edward Gaffron assembled In Peru during 
the 19th Century and made famous through German publications. 
It was soon to form the founding acquisition of the Institute's 
Department of Primitive Art — the first such department estab- 
lished in a major art museum. In 1954 the Museum of Modern Art 
presented Its renowned "Ancient Arts of the Andes" show which 
Included objects from all the western South American countries, 
assembled by Rene d'Harnoncourt from sources In Europe, the 
United States, and South America. The exhibition travelled to 
Minneapolis and San Francisco. 

In 1955 Peru sent an exhibition of ancient, colonial, and modern 
Peruvian art to Mexico City and Toronto followed by a larger 
exhibit of the same type shown in 1957 in Paris. Since that time 
there have been numerous exhibitions of varying size and 
emphasis in museums throughout the world. The present ex- 
hibition Is the largest, most comprehensive and, we believe, the 
most selective ever assembled of those limited to the country's 
ancient heritage. It has been drawn almost entirely from seven 
national museums and twenty-six private collections In Peru. A 
large proportion of the objects shown have never before been 
exhibited or published outside the country. 

GEOGRAPHY 

To understand the complexity of Ancient Peruvian cultural history 
one must begin with an awareness of the country's diverse and 
hostile geography. Formidable physical barriers tended to sep- 
arate the population Into more or less Isolated groups. Progress 
towards civilization was the result of the ancient Peruvians' 
organized efforts to survive and prosper within the harsh limi- 
tations of their environment. A brief discussion of the three prin- 
cipal geographical zones of Peru will afford the reader an under- 
standing of the character of the ancient civilizations they produced 



and some comprehension of the problems facing the modern 
researcher in his attempts to reconstruct the history of these 
areas. 

THE COAST 

The most accessible and best l&lt;nown area of Peru is its narrow 
coastal plain cut at uneven intervals by about forty river valleys. 
These valleys vary considerably in size, and in the amount of 
vi^ater their rivers bring dov\/n from the mountains. Some streams 
flow to the sea all year round, while others furnish water for a 
relatively short period. In ancient times survival depended on the 
efficient use of water by irrigation and the stock piling of staple 
foods such as corn and beans against long periods of drought. 
The climate was ideal but life was always precarious. Natural 
disasters such as flash floods or earthquakes could destroy cities 
and irrigation systems without warning, and the population had 
to be constantly alert against armed invasion by peoples from 
less fortunate climes. Even the sea, an important source of food, 
was subject to unpredictable cycles of fecundity. 
Quite naturally, the more extensive and well watered valleys, 
which could support large populations, became the homes of the 
more advanced ancient civilizations. Groups of valleys in close 
geographic proximity tended to form federations for greater 
economic and military security. Population centers were con- 
centrated along the valley's desert margins and on land elevated 
above the broad intensively cultivated valley floor. Preference 
was given to sites that were easily defensible and further pro- 
tection was afforded by strategically placed walls and garrisoned 
fortifications. Since rains were rare and no threat to adobe 
building, most construction was of that material. 
Because of their wealth and accessibility, the coastal cities were 
among the first to be sacked during the conquest, and during the 
colonial treasure hunt and subsequent huaquero activity scarcely 
a coastal site large or small escaped being plundered. Architec- 
tural remains not destroyed in the pillage have suffered from 
earthquakes and wind-driven sand. In the north they have also 
been eroded by infrequent rains. Yet there is one great com- 
pensation to the archeologist faced with such handicaps. The 
preservation of archeological materials in the arid sandy wastes 
of the coast is remarkable. Fragile textiles, feather work and 
other perishable materials are often found in almost perfect 
condition. 

Strange as it may seem, many of the largest and most impressive 
ruins on the coast are among the least understood. Their thorough 
study will require sustained archeological campaigns such as 
have characterized the archeology of the Mediterranean area but 
which have not yet been initiated in Peru. 

THE HIGHLANDS 

The second important geographical zone of Peru is composed of 
the incredibly rugged Central Andes crowded with peaks rising 
as high as 22,205 feet above sea level. To the north, the zone is 
comparatively narrow and is made up of ranges running roughly 
parallel to the coast. These broaden out in the central highlands 



and in the south form a vast high plateau much of which is barren 
and inhospitable. 

Water is plentiful throughout much of this zone but, because of 
the high altitude and harsh topography, only a few of the more 
extensive highland basins and intermountain valleys were capable 
of supporting large unified populations. Life in the highlands was 
and is hard. Floods, landslides, and earthquakes are an ever 
present menace. The practice of agriculture is difficult and travel 
is arduous in the rugged terrain and lung-bursting altitudes, yet 
the Andean Indian long ago became well adapted to his strenuous 
environment. His carefully terraced fields climb up the mountain 
sides to 16,000 feet and higher, and a vast network of trails 
traverses the steep scarps and mountain ridges where modern 
roads cannot follow. The ruins of countless well constructed 
stone cities and fortifications give eloquent testimony to the 
organization, skill, and tenacity of the ancient population. As we 
shall soon see, three times in the history of ancient Peru highland 
peoples were able to bring all, or nearly all, of the Central Andean 
area under their sway. 

Much of the highland area has been explored by archeologists 
but physical hardship has limited their excavations to a few 
samplings in some of the more accessible areas. Little is known 
of the regional cultures that lay outside the temporal span and 
sphere of influence of the three major Pan-Andean civilizations 
and even the history and origin of these is shrouded in mystery. 
Not only is the work of the archeologist more difficult in the high- 
lands but it is much less rewarding in terms of well preserved art 
objects than on the coast. Perishable materials such as textiles 
survive only under the most fortuitous circumstances. 

THE EASTERN SLOPES 

The third archeologically important zone of Peru is made up of the 
Jungle-shrouded eastern slopes of the Andes. It is an area of 
heavy rainfall where deeply cut valleys drop abruptly in altitude 
as they merge with the upper Amazon basin. For many years the 
zone was thought to be archeologically unimportant on the 
grounds that its dense tropical vegetation was incompatible with 
highland agricultural techniques. 

Persistent reports of large and impressive jungle cities tended to 
be ignored until in recent years the well documented and widely 
publicized discoveries of the American explorer Gene Savoy 
prodded the archeologists into action. Now an increasing number 
of scientific incursions into the zone have been made and excited 
reports of new discoveries follow in rapid succession. It is 
obvious that the area developed distinctive regional cultures of 
its own. Few ceramic styles have yet been identified and perish- 
able materials do not survive, but the architecture shows a 
preference for circular forms as opposed to the generally rec- 
tangular tradition of the highlands. 

In the vicinity of Pucallpa on the eastern limits of the zone, 
Donald Lothrop has conducted excavations which reveal a long 
unbroken sequence of highly sophisticated cultures in the area. 
Some of his earlier levels suggest relationships to the site of 
Kotosh in the Central Andes recently excavated by the University 



of Tokyo. As the eastern slopes of the Andes are opened up to 
the outside world by President Belaunde's new marginal highway, 
we may expect an ever Increasing number of important dis- 
coveries. Some may revolutionize our thinking about the origin 
and evolution of ancient Andean civilization. 

SUMMARY 

After a century of archeological Investigation, the broad outlines 
of ancient Peruvian cultural history in the coastal valleys are 
known, though our knowledge is far from complete. Only a few 
highland centers have been investigated and much remains to be 
done before we will fully understand the history and character 
of ancient civilizations in this important area. Of the eastern 
slopes of the Andes we know almost nothing other than its 
important potential as an area for future research. 
The exhibition, like the collections from which it is drawn, places 
vastly disproportionate emphasis on the coastal zone, and there- 
fore gives a distorted impression of ancient Andean civilizations. 
This is inevitable, not only because of the unequal attention the 
zones have received from archeologists (and the huaquero) but 
on account of drastically different conditions affecting the sur- 
vival of archeological materials. 

In selecting objects for the exhibition, the curator has placed 
primary emphasis on esthetic quality while at the same time seek- 
ing to present the major aspects of ancient Peruvian art. Special 
attention was given to major art styles such as Chavin and Vicus 
which have not previously been shown in quantity outside Peru. 
Ceramics, because of their consistent survival, make up the bulk 
of the show. Through the courtesy of the Trustees of The Textile 
Museum in Washington, D.C., some of the finest textiles in 
Peruvian collections have been cleaned and mounted for the 
exhibition under the supervision of their conservation staff. Many 
of the finest objects of gold in Peruvian collections recently 
toured the United States and most owners were therefore reluc- 
tant to lend them again after so short an interval of time. 
In the catalog of the exhibition that follows, the listing of each 
group of objects is preceded by a brief resume of their cultural 
background. Space does not permit a discussion of the many 
problems of chronology and cultural relationship which engage 
the Peruvianist. The curator has therefore had to state his inter- 
pretations without qualifying argument. 



PROLOGUE 



Peru's earliest inhabitants were nomadic bands of Stone Age hunt- 
ers, fishermen, and food gatherers who roamed the coast and 
highlands between seven and twelve thousand years ago and 
perhaps earlier. Subsequent occupation of the more inhabitable 
areas have obliterated all traces of their campsites but artifacts 
have been found in ancient shell middens along the Pacific shore, 
in highland caves, and in once verdant areas of the coastal desert 
left desolate by climate change. One such area is the Pampa de 
los Fosiles in the barren Cupisnique Quebrada located in the 
desert between the Chicama and Jequetepeque Valleys on the 
north coast.

THE EARLIEST PERUVIAN ART 



THE EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD 



From about 5,000 to 3,000 B.C. there was a gradual transition 
throughout the central Andean area from the nomadic way of life 
to the establishment of permanent settlements utilizing domesti- 
cated plants and animals to supplement wild food supplies. At 
the site of one such community on the north coast, Huaca Prieta 
in the Chicama Valley, Dr. Junius B. Bird discovered the earliest 
known art objects of Peru. 

The stratified refuse of Huaca Prieta yielded a large number of 
fragments of twined cotton textiles that Dr. Bird has shown, 
through careful analysis of their warp movements, to have been 
ornamented with highly stylized bird, animal, human, and other 
motifs. He also found the fragile remains of two small beautifully 
carved gourds which, because of their dissimilarity to other ex- 
cavated materials, he has suggested were importations to the 
site. The surprising degree of sophistication in the designs of 
both the textiles and the gourds indicate that a considerable 
period of cultural development had preceded them.

The earliest known ceramics from Peru are dated around 2,000 
B.C. By 1,500 B.C. the basic techniques of reduction and oxi- 
dation firing and modes of decoration such as incising, painting, 
and the use of clay slip were all being practiced. The following 
examples were excavated by Dr. Bird at a site close by Huaca 
Prieta.

THE ART OF CHAVIN 



HIGHLAND CHAVIN STONE CARVINGS 



The first great civilization of Peru crystalized in the northern 
highlands around 1,200 B.C. It is called Chavin after the most 
famous of its ceremonial centers at Chavin de Huantar, a little 
town in the Mosna Valley, one of the southernmost branches of 
the large Marainon Valley that bisects the Northern Andes, 
Another elaborate temple complex called Pacopampa is located 
over 200 miles to the north-west in the western reaches of the 
Maranon drainage. Many other Chavin sites have been found in 
the area between and in the valleys of the north coast. The 
influence of Chavin religion and its distinctive art style has been 
traced northward into Ecuador and south along the coast as far 
as the Nazca Valley, a span of 1 ,000 miles. 

In the light of present knowledge, the Chavin culture appeared 
suddenly, full grown, advanced in the arts and architecture, and 
motivated by a dynamic religion. This has led to speculation as to 
its possible relationships with the Chou Dynasty in China and the 
Olmec civilization of Mexico, both of which were contemporary. 
Chavin art features jungle creatures such as the jaguar, cayman, 
and serpent, and it is possible that the original home of the 
Chavin people may someday be found hidden under the dense 
tropical foliage of the little explored eastern slopes of the Andes. 




The symbolism of Chavin art is best displayed in the superb 
reliefs and carvings that ornamented the culture's principal stone 
structures. The basic elements are few: jaguar, human, bird of 
prey, cayman, and serpent, but they are combined with infinite 
complexity into apparitions of powerful supernatural beings. 
Since many of these carvings are massive and could not be 
moved, we supplemented our examples with rubbings taken from 
the originals by Fred D. Ayers, and lent to us by the American 
Museum of Natural History. The Chavin style is thought to have 
covered a period of about 800 years. Exact chronological 
relationships have not yet been established and our dates are 
therefore expressed in broad tentative terms.

THE CHAVIN ART OF CHONGOYAPE 

A number of Chavin style gold objects have been found in the 
vicinity of Chongoyape in the Lambayeque Valley. By comparison 
with Highland Chavin stone monuments, most may be assigned to 
the Middle Chavin period. Ceramics found in the same area are 
characterized by the skillful use of surface texture, and are usually 
non-religious in subject matter. The examples listed here are 
tentatively assigned to the same period as the gold.

Sr. Raphael Larco gave the name Cupisnique to north coast 
Chavin ceramics after finding sherds of the type in the Cupis- 
nique Quebrada in 1933. Most ceramics of the style have been 
found in the Chicama Valley at sites such as Sausal. This selec- 
tion all dates from the Late Chavin period.

THE CHAVIN ART OF TEMBLADERA 



In recent years a large number of Chavin ceramics and stone 
artifacts fiave appeared on the market whicfi are said to have 
come from the vicinity of Tembladera in the Jequetepeque Valley. 
The style is contemporary with, and very similar to that of, Cupis- 
nique, but tends to be more flamboyant with greater emphasis on 
religious subjects. This might be explained by its close proximity 
to the important Chavin ceremonial center at Kuntur Wasi (La 
Copa) higher up in the Jequetepeque Valley. Evidently, there is 
an absence of ground water at the burial sites since paints applied 
after firing are often well preserved. (They were also used on 
Cupisnique and other Chavin pottery styles, but seldom survive.)

THE ART OF VICUS 



CHAVIN ART IN TRANSITION 

Towards the end of the long Chavin period centralized control of 
the culture waned and Chavin art displayed the strong techno- 
logical and cultural influences of new groups moving into the 
north coast area. This change was particularly evident in ceramics 
which showed a shift to oxidation firing and the use of colored 
clay slips with traditional incised lines.

Six years ago huaqueros encountered ancient burials in the upper 
Piura Valley near a hill called Cerro Vicus on the hacienda Pabur. 
Their discovery touched off one of the greatest flurries of hua- 
quero activity in recent times. Literally thousands of graves were 
opened and today the vast cemetery lies depleted, looking like a 
World War I battlefield. 

The flood of art materials which appeared on the market as a 
result of this new find has caused great excitement and no little 
confusion among Peruvianists. A bewildering variety of art ob- 
jects is represented with some clear relationships to, and many 
striking differences from, previously known ancient Peruvian art 
styles. Ceramics can now be assigned with some degree of 
certainty to phases within two cultural periods: Classic Vicus, 
and Negative Vicus. Many gold, copper, and stone objects are, 
however, still difficult to place in their proper chronological 
context. 

The owner of the hacienda Pabur, Sr. Domingo Seminario, unable 
to control the activities of the huaqueros, began buying the finest 
of the Vicus materials as soon as they appeared and today has 
the largest and richest collection of the styles in the world 
Almost our entire selection is derived from this source.

THE CLASSIC VICUS CERAMIC STYLE, 
400 B.C.-100 A.D. 



The Classis Vicus ceramic style is closely related in many ways 
to that of the early periods of the Mochica culture found in the 
Chicama and Moche Valleys some 200 miles to the south. The 
northern varient is, however, superior from both a technical and 
artistic point of view. The range of its subject matter, while over- 
lapping, is far wider and it shows a greater preference for sculp- 
tural rather than painted pottery. The historical relationship 
between the two centers is as yet not understood and we know 
litlte about the early periods in the extensive valleys which lie 
between them. The dates and phase designations used in our 
discussion here are, therefore, tentative. The Classic Vicus cul- 
ture may prove to be the parent of Mochica. 



CLASSIC VICUS CERAMICS, CHAVINOID PHASE, 
400-300 B.C. 

The early phase of Classic Vicus ceramics is strongly Chavinoid 
and may well be at least partly contemporary with the final transi- 
tional period. Chavin ceramics are found at Vicus (Nos. 25, 76, 77, 
79, and 81) and a nearby site called Morropon. The Chavinoid 
phase style is characterized by strongly modeled forms and fine 
line incised detail. A preference is shown for black or greyware, 
but some mauve and orangewares decorated with cream slip as 
well as incising, do occur.

CLASSIC VICUS CERAMICS, MATURE PHASE, 
300-100 B.C. 



The term mature is used to indicate the fully developed early 
Vicus style. The virtuosity of Vicus ceramists was no doubt due 
in part to the superior clays they had to v^ork with, but their 
creative genius ranks them among the finest artist craftsmen of 
ancient Peru.

CLASSIC VICUS CERAMICS, VIRU PHASE, 
100 B.C.-lOO A.D. 

Towards the end of the mature phase, Vicus ceramics began to 
manifest the strong influence of a culture known as Viru (Galli- 
nazo). This group had appeared on the north coast at the close 
of the Chavin period and had been displaced in the Chicama and 
Moche Valleys by the Mochica culture. It was known to have 
continued in the Viru and other Valleys to the south (see Nos. 
191-210), but its movement northward to the Piura Valley had 
not been suspected. While the Viru culture had little effect on 
Mochica art, its ceramic style blended smoothly with that of the 
mature phase of Classic Vicus indicating a peaceful merging of 
the two traditions. 

Ceramics in a pure Viru style are found at Vicus (Nos. 112-116) 
exhibiting their typical simplified modeling and peculiar long taper- 
ing spout and arched tubular handle. Most pieces showing a 
blending of the two styles have this type of spout and handle 
(Nos. 117-123), but some have the traditional stirrup spout of 
Classic Vicus ceramics (Nos. 1 24-1 28).

CLASSIC VICUS AND "FRIAS" GOLD 



An infinite variety of gold nose ornaments and other objects are 
reported to have been found at Vicus and at a site called Frias 
near Ayabaca about 50 miles to the north east in the highlands 
near the Ecuadorian border. No archeologist has yet visited Frias 
and there is an unexplained absence of ceramics and other 
material associated with "Frias gold". Stylistically, there is little 
to distinguish it from that for which there is more reliable Vicus 
provenience. While we cannot rule out the existence of other 
sites, we will treat the gold as one stylistic unit. 
It is extremely difficult to relate Vicus gold and ceramic objects 
stylistically since the two mediums impose quite different limi- 
tations on craftsmen. The only evidence we have to go on are 
actual miniature gold nose ornaments on modeled pottery ( # 97), 
sculptural representations of figures wearing gold ornaments 
(#119) and painted motifs on pottery which appear to relate more 
closely to gold motifs than to the sculptured ones ( # 128). An 
examination of such meagre indications has led to the following 
hypotheses: that the Classic Vicus culture was skilled at fash- 
ioning gold ornaments by soldering together thin sheet gold, 
twisted gold wire and gold granules; and that the Viru culture 
introduced the use of repousse, and bi-metallic (gold and silver 
or electrum) sheets. As with the ceramics, it is assumed that 
there was a considerable blending of the two traditions during 
the Viru phase of the Classic Vicus period.

THE NEGATIVE VICUS STYLE, 100-700 A.D. 



TRANSITIONAL NEGATIVE VICUS CERAMICS, 
100-200 A.D. 



In 1966 Dr. Hans Disselhoff conducted a brief excavation at Vicus 
in which he encountered burials containing negative decorated 
pottery. Carbon 14 tests of organic materials found associated 
with them yielded dates averaging around 300 A.D. This important 
discovery establishes without question the fact that the negative 
style follows that of the Classic Vicus and is roughly contem- 
porary with the fourth period of Mochica. It does not, however, 
provide a basis for the chronological ordering of the many 
stylistic variations within Negative Vicus pottery. The broad 
period designations proposed here are tentative and need further 
refinement by careful seriation. 



The earliest ceramics of the Negative Vicus Period clearly show 
the influence of the Classic Vicus tradition it displaced. Classic 
subjects are translated into the more primitive negative wares and 
the stirrup spout form is often copied. Only rarely, however, did 
the new ceramists use the fine clays preferred by their predeces- 
sors.

THE EARLY NEGATIVE VICUS STYLE, 200-500 A.D. 



THE LATE NEGATIVE VICUS STYLE, 500-700 A.D. 



Ceramics of the Early Negative Vicus period bear some style 
relationships to those of Viru but are much more primitive and 
exhibit far less technical skill. Closer stylistic relationships may 
be found to the north, Vi/ith pottery found in Ecuador and Colum- 
bia. Whatever their cultural ties may have been. Negative Vicus 
ceramics have a persuasive, almost childlike, charm of their own. 
The examples listed are, with few exceptions, of two ceramic 
types. One is a double vessel, one-half bottle, the other, a sculp- 
tural figure. The other is a watermellon-shaped bottle with a 
spout and a bridge-like handle leading to a modeled head or 
figure. Both types have a whistle in the sculptural portion which 
sounds when liquid within the ceramic is sloshed.

In the late period of the Negative Vicus style the same ceramic 
forms continued but tended to become smaller, better executed, 
and more elaborate in their negative and cream slip decoration. 
Spouts become longer and more tapered until at the end of the 
period the double spout bottle form became a direct precedent 
for those of the later North Coast Wari, Lambayeque, Chimu, and 
Inca wares. ( # 183.)

NEGATIVE VICUS GOLD, 100-500 A.D. 



NEGATIVE VICUS STYLE COPPER OBJECTS 



The metalurgical skills of the Negative Vicus peoples were not 
as advanced as their predecessors'. They did, however, master 
the technique of combining gold with electrum to form heavy 
bi-metalllc nose ornaments. ( # 184) The wearing of this type of 
ornament is shown in ceramic # 107 where the bi-metallic division 
is clearly indicated. Ceramic # 181 shows a late period version 
of the same kind of nose ornament. The dangles of # 184-A may 
indicate that it belongs in the transition period, but no assignment 
to period is attempted for the other pieces.

THE EARLY HISTORY 

OF THE NORTH COAST OF PERU 



Thanks mainly to the research and publications of Rafael Larco 
Hoyle, the chronological sequence of ancient cultures on the 
north coast is well understood. He has shown that a group called 
Salinar moved into the area at the close of the Cupisnique 
(Coastal Chavin) period and that it was soon supplanted by the 
Viru (Gallinazo) culture. The Mochica (Moche) people then oc- 
cupied the Chicama and Moche Valleys, but the Viru style con- 
tinued to dominate the nearby Viru Valley. We have already 
witnessed the impact of the Viru culture on the late phase of 
Classic Vicus art on the far north coast. The ceramics listed 
below demonstrate the Inter-mixing of styles which took place in 
the transition period between Chavin and Mochica times, and the 
Viru style, in the valley for which it is named.

THE RECUAY CULTURE, 300 B.C.-700 A.D. 



Another culture which exerted a formative influence on the early 
phases of the Mochica style was Recuay, named after a town In 
the highland valley called the Callijon de Huaylas where its 
ceramics were first found. The Recuay style is encountered over 
an extremely wide area, including the coastal valleys from the 
Viru to the Casma and inland to the Maranon. Its center appears 
to have been the Santa river drainage (which includes the 
Callijon) but little is known of its history and stylistic develop- 
ment.

The highland stone temples of the Recuay culture were orna- 
mented with sculptured tenoned heads, high reliefs, and free- 
standing figure sculpture. In Post-Wari times, this practice con- 
tinued, though the carvings are more primitive. The late style is 
called Huaylas. The dividing line betwesn the two styles is 
difficult to define.

THE MOCHICA CULTURE, 200 B.C.-700 A.D. 



Mochica ceramics are perhaps the best known art of ancient 
Peru- The sensitive realism of their modeled subjects and the 
animation and expressiveness of their painted scenes have often 
been noted. The superlative examples shown in this exhibition 
can only enhance the style's reputation as one of the greatest 
ceramic traditions the world has ever seen. 

Rafael Larco published detailed studies of the Mochica ceramic 
style in which he defined five periods. The first three appear to 
have been rather short evolutionary phases, while the fourth was 
a long period of maturity and the fifth a period of gradual decline. 
With the discovery of the Classic Vicus style, it became apparent 
that the origin of the Mochica culture could not be explained in 
terms of developments in the Chicama and Moche Valleys alone. 
It must have been strongly influenced by its northern counterpart, 
and did not assume artistic leadership of the joint tradition until 
its third period- 

All Mochica ceramics listed are stirrup spout bottles unless 
otherwise indicated 



THE MOCHICA I CERAMIC STYLE, 200-50 B.C. 

Ceramics of this period were simple and monumental with little 
of the attention to detail which characterized the Mature Classic 
Vicus style (compare Nos. 108 and 236).

THE MOCHICA III CERAMIC STYLE, 0-200 A.D. 

In the third period Mochica ceramic art reached technical and 
artistic maturity. The cameo-like perfection of its finest wares was 
never to be surpassed. A greater range of colored slips were 
employed. Spouts had a characteristic flaring rim and were some- 
times concave in profile.

THE MOCHICA V CERAMiC STYLE, 500-700 A.D. 

The last period of the Mochica culture was one of gradual decline 
as it experienced the ever increasing pressure of the agressive 
highland Wari people which finally brought about its collapse 
around 700 A.D. Both modeled and painted pottery were often 
executed in a rather perfunctory manner. Painted ceramics in 
particular express a kind of nervous tension which must have 
been characteristic of the times. The surfaces of vassels were 
crowded with motifs and space fillers. 

Number 294 of this exhibition is a most extraordinary masterpiece 
of the Mochica V period. Literally hundreds of animated figures 
are crowded upon the bottles' surface, acting out an elaborate 
ritual scene evidently representing offerings being brought to the 
warrior king. It is as if by their intensity they sought to stave off 
their impending doom. The work is an eloquent testimony of the 
tenacious vitality of a long and glorious tradition.

THE PARACAS CULTURE, 1,100-200 B.C. 



CHAVINOID PARACAS CERAMICS, 1,100-700 B.C. 



The term Paracas is used to cover a very long and complex inter- 
play of cultural traditions that took place on the south coast of 
Peru during most of the first millennium B.C. Archeological infor- 
mation is spotty and chronological relationships between regional 
styles as well as dating are a matter of some speculation. The 
general trends of cultural development are known, however, and 
the periods indicated place objects in their relative positions in 
time. Numbered phase designations published by Menzel, Rowe 
and Dawson are correlated with these periods on the chronology 
chart. Like Tembladera ceramics, those of Paracas styles gener- 
ally have well preserved paints applied after firing. Potteries 
have incised designs and the typical form is a double spout bottle 
with one spout non-functional and in the form of a modeled head. 
Exceptions are noted. 




309 



The Paracas culture began with a period of strong Chavin 
influence during which changing stylistic trends in the north were 
reflected. The first two examples are negative wares which may 
represent the local pre-Chavin pottery tradition. They are curi- 
ously related to early Columbian and Ecuadorian ceramic styles.

Around 500 B.C. a new religion and iconography involving a 
trophy head cult gained dominance at Ocucaje and other impor- 
tant centers while it appears to have had relatively less effect on 
others that continued to follow their Chavinoid traditions. (Juan 
Pablo, Callango, Palpa Valley.)

PARACAS TEXTILES, 500-200 B.C. 



The most famous event in the history of Peruvian art and archeol- 
ogy was unquestionably the discovery of the Paracas Necropolis 
cemetery by Tello in 1925. On the sandy slopes of a hill called 
Cerro Colorado overlooking the Paracas bay, he found several 
hundred funeral bundles within the foundation of ancient build- 
ings. When he opened the larger of these bundles, he found the 
body encased by layer after layer of exquisitely embroidered 
mantles and other garments separated by plain cotton shrouds. 
We are privileged to have a number of these fabulous textiles in 
this exhibition. Paracas textiles have also been found at Ocucaje 
and other sites but none match the splendor of the Necropolis

THE PROTO NAZCA PERIOD, 200-100 B.C. 



NECROPOLIS CERAMIC TYPES, 200-100 B.C. 



Towards the end of the Late period, Paracas ceramics and tex- 
tiles began to reflect new religious concepts. An increasing 
number of natural motifs such as birds and animals joined the 
symbols of the trophy head cult. In the Proto Nazca period thai 
followed, this trend culminated in the formation of the Nazca 
culture whose main religious preoccupation was agricultural 
fertility. At the same time, ceramics were undergoing a techno- 
logical revolution evidently stimulated by Necropolis techniques 
but centered in the Rio Grande de Nazca Valley. 



Necropolis ceramics justly famous for their superb technology 
and sophisticated simplicity were found by Tello with Proto 
Nazca period textiles at Cerro Colorado. (Nos. 378-381.) Similar 
types have been found at Ocucaje (Nos. 382-384).

OTHER PROTO NAZCA ART FORMS, 200-100 B.C. 



Ceramists shifted from the use of resin paints to colored clay 
slips as the medium of decorating pottery. At the close of the 
period ceramics had only to lose their incised lines to become 
Early Nazca in style.

THE NAZCA CULTURE, 200 B.C.-600 A.D. 



The emergence of the vital new Nazca style reflects the develop- 
ment of a dynamic new religion which unified the peoples of the 
south coast valleys for the first time. Its emphasis was on life 
rather than on death, and Early Nazca art expresses joy with all 
living things and wonder at the generative power of nature. As 
the Nazca culture evolved, ceramics and textile designs reflected 
an increasing emphasis on the mystery of life, expressed in a 
complex pantheon of mythological beings symbolizing spiritual 
powers. 

Nazca ceramics occupy a unique position in world art for their 
unsurpassed mastery of the use of colored slip decoration and 
their subtle relationship of ornamentation and form. As many as 
twelve or fourteen distinct colors may be found on a single 
vessel. For convenience of discussion, Nazca art is divided into 
early, middle and late periods. They are correlated on the chronol- 
ogy chart with nine phases proposed by Lawrence Dawson 
which include one each for the formative Proto Nazca and the 
final Nazca Wari phases.

THE LATE NAZCA STYLE, 300-600 A.D. 



THE NAZCA WARI TRANSITION 600-700 A.D. 



The beginning of the Late Nazca style is marked by a sudden 
elaboration in the rendering of whiskered diety motifs. Face 
whiskers, forehead ornaments and plumes proliferate in detail 
until they almost obscure the basic motif. These elements are 
rendered in sharp, crisp lines interspersed with barb-like trophy 
hair symbols, making the surface of ceramics crackle with energy 
like a Fourth of July sparkler. (Nos. 447-449.) Vegetable guardian 
dieties are elaborate but still recognizable ( # 450). 
The reason for this dramatic change in the Nazca art style is still 
obscure. Some strong outside influence seems to have been 
involved and the highland Ayacucho area is suspected as its 
source. Relationships between the highland cultures and the 
Nazca grew progressively stronger during the period.

During the final phases of the Late Nazca period a vigorous new 
highland culture with its capitol at Wari near Ayacucho developed 
as the result of the conversion of the local Nazca-related culture 
to the militant religion of the Tiahuanaco people located in the 
southern high-plane around Lake Titicaca. The conversion must 
have been peaceful since Tiahuanaco ceramic types do not occur 
at Wari as they would have, had a conquest been involved. Tia- 
huanaco ceramics were thin and elegant polychrome wares (see 
Nos. 544-547). Wari pottery was simple in form, solidly construct- 
ed, and decorated in a few clear colors with red and orange pre- 
dominant. They soon displaced late Nazca types on the south 
coast.

THE WARI ART STYLE 600-1,000 A.D. 



Wari iconography follows that of the Tiahuanaco culture quite 
closely and most of its motifs may be found on stone monuments 
at the great ruined city of Tiahuanaco in Bolivia. It is quite likely 
that these motifs were brought to Wari primarily on textiles. 
Finely woven tapestry designs of the period often follow Tia- 
huanaco models closely, and some motifs peculiar to these 
textiles are frequently seen on Wari ceramics (Nos. 479, 488, etc.) 
though they are not characteristic of Tiahuanaco pottery. 
After the Tiahuanaco religion was firmly established at Wari the 
culture quickly and aggressively brought most of Peru under its 
control. This expansion does not appear to have been as peace- 
ful as it evidently had been in the south coast. The subjugation 
of an area is usually recorded for the archeologist by a thick 
layer of ashes above which few vestiges of the conquered 
people's culture survive. 

The war-like spirit of the Wari is admirably conveyed by their art 
style. Motifs are rendered in strong straight and curved lines 
accented by striking color contrasts. Craftmanship is highly com- 
petent and the total effect is one of strength and vitality. Wari 
ceramics of remarkable uniform quality are found throughout the 
area the culture once dominated. Since regional Wari styles are 
also found it is inferred that the highland types were for special 
ceremonial or official use

WARI TEXTILES 

Finely woven interlocking tapestry poncho shirts that were evi- 
dently official Wari garments have also been found in all parts 
of the Wari controlled area. Like Wari ceramics, they are quite 
uniform in quality, design and technique of manufacture. The 
weaving of two matched halves of the garment on an extremely 
broad horizontal loom appears to be a higland tradition that may 
have originated at Tiahuanaco. Several distinct groups of motifs 
occur, each evidently associated with a definite rank of official. 
The following examples show the principle design types listed in 
the order of their frequency of occurence.

A GLIMPSE OF SOUTHERN HIGHLAND 
STYLES 



Not enough is known of the archeology of the southern highlands 
for us to be able to reconstruct its early history with any reason- 
able degree of clarity. Excavations have been conducted at 
Pukara, a site northwest of Lake Titicaca, revealing an early 
culture whose incised and slip decorated ceramics and stone 
sculpture show a close relationship with the Tiahuanaco culture. 
It has been proven to be contemporary with the early cultural 
stages at Tiahuanaco, Bolivia, but the relationship between the 
two groups is not yet understood.

THE EARLY LIMA STYLE, 100-700 A.D. 



During the first millennium B.C., cultural development in the 
central coast area lagged somewhat behind that of the north and 
south coast zones. In the early centuries of the Christian era, 
however, large ceremonial centers were constructed in the Rimac 
and neighboring valleys by what is called the Early Lima or 
Maranga culture. The ceramic art of this group is less known than 
that of their Mochica and Nazca contemporaries, but in its own 
way it is their esthetic equal. 

Early Lima ceramics are relatively rare in museum collections due 
in part to the heavy looting of cemeteries in the area during 
colonial times. They are a fine orangeware and combine skillful 
modelling with artful slip decoration.

CENTRAL COAST WARI STYLES, 700-1000 A.D. 



Around 600 A.D., the Early Lima culture came under strong high- 
land influence and soon its capitol Pachicamac became one of 
the most important Wari ceremonial centers on the coast. Typical 
Wari wares are found at Pachicamac, but elsewhere on the 
central coast ceramics showed a distinctly regional interpreta- 
tion of the Wari style.

THE NORTH COAST WARI STYLE 

A distinctive coastal Wari ceramic style is found in the area 
formerly dominated by the Mochica culture (the Casma to the 
Chicama Valleys). It is usually rather crudely made orangeware, 
densely decorated with highly stylized motifs in black and white 
slip. At its best it exhibits a barbaric vitality.

THE PERIOD OF KINGDOMS AND 
CONFEDERATIONS, 1000-1450 A.D. 



Following the break up of the Wari empire the populations of 
groups of neighbouring coastal valleys and large highland basins 
were unified into a number of separate kingdoms and confedera- 
tions. They varied considerably in size and prosperity but some 
of them on the coast achieved great advancement in social and 
political organization and constructed large well planned cities 
and ceremonial centers. By comparison with earlier epochs, the 
level of artistic achievement during this period generally declined 
but the irrepressible vitality of ancient Peruvian society con- 
tinued to be expressed in a variety of regional styles. 

THE CAJAMARCA STYLE, 1000-1450 

Cajamarca had become the cultural center of the northern high- 
lands during the Wari period. It continued as a focus of northern 
cultural activity down to the time of the conquest when it was 
the setting for the Incas fatal confrontation with Pizarro in 1532. 
The term Cajamarca is applied to a variety of related ceramic 
styles found over a wide area extending from the upper portions 
of the coastal valleys to the Maranon. Many examples found in 
recent years are said to have come from the vicinity of Tembla- 
dera. The Cajamarca style shows a continuation of late Recuay 
slip decorated creamware types modified by Wari influence.

THE LAMBAYEQUE KINGDOM, 700-1200 A.D. 



THE LAMBAYEQUE STYLE, 700-1200 A.D. 



The Lambayeque valley occupies the broad coastal plain just 
below the Sechura Desert on the far north coast of Peru. Actually 
it is a complex of three valleys incorporating the Leche and 
Motupe, whose rivers never reach the sea. Together they irrigate 
the largest single area of cultivated land in modern Peru. In 
ancient times the area under cultivation was much larger since 
today's crops of rice and sugar cane use several times the 
amount of water needed for pre-Columbian corn and beans. 
The research of Paul Kosok and others has revealed that the 
ancients had also incorporated the Zafia and Jequetepeque 
valleys to the south into one vast irrigation network with the 
Lambayeque bringing over 100 miles of coastal plain under con- 
tinuous cultivation. Kosok estimates that the combined area com- 
prised one third of the cultivated land in pre-Columbian coastal 
Peru and supported an equal proportion of its population. 
It is a surprising fact that this important zone teeming with ancient 
ruins, is one of the least studied and understood of all Peru. Its 
remoteness from Lima and its very size and complexity have 
discouraged archeologists. It will require a sustained program 
of many specialists to unveil its secrets. 

Practically nothing is known of early Lambayeque history though 
there are indications that it shared some of the cultural trends 
recently discovered at Vicus. A few Mochica V ceramics have 
been discovered at Batan Grande in the Leche valley ( # 299), 
along with even fewer examples of the Wari style (Nos. 510 and 
533) but neither of those cultures appear to have gained much of 
a foothold north of the Zaina valley. The large and well organized 
Lambayeque population, while susceptible to outside influences, 
appears to have maintained its independence until around 1200 
when it was incorporated into the expanding Chimu empire. 



Unless otherwise indicated, the following ceramics are

applied after firing are also preserved. ( # 610.) This

A SAMPLE FROM TUMBES 



Tumbes, where Pizarro landed in 1532, is the northernmost port 
of modern Peru. The area is archeologically related to the great 
Bay of Guayaquil region of Ecuador. Though Tumbes means 
tombs, very few ancient art objects from the area have found 
their way into museums and private collections. Our single 
example offers a glimpse of a strange style unrelated to other 
Peruvian antiquities.

THE CHIMU KINGDOM, 1000-1470 A.D. 



The largest and most impressive ruin on the coast of Peru is 
Chan Chan near Trujillo which was the capitol of the Chimu, the 
best known of the kingdoms that formed after the collapse of the 
Wari empire. It was in many ways a renaissance of the Mochica 
culture. By the 15th century the Chimu had extended their in- 
fluence throughout most of the coast of Peru and were the 
principle rivals of the Incas. 

Chimu ceramics were predominantely blackwares and in the 
absence of specific knowledge there has been a tendency to 
lump all black ceramics under the term, especially those of 
diverse north costal groups which were eventually absorbed into 
the Chimu empire. Most of these late ceramics were mass pro- 
duced and poor in quality, giving the term Chimu a connotation 
of artistic decadence. By careful selection, this exhibition dem- 
onstrates that Chimu art at its best is worthy of inclusion among 
ancient Peru's great art styles. 

The sequence of Chimu art styles has not been well clarified 
archeologically. The tentative periods suggested below place 
the selected examples in what seems to be their general chrono- 
logical order.

CHANCAY CERAMICS 

Chancay ceramics, like those of the Chimu have been looked 
down on because of their abundance and connparatively poor 
workmanship. The style is primitive, almost child-like, but while 
it is never particularly forceful, it often has great charm. It began 
in early post-Wari times with the use of red and black on cream 
slip, but gradually dropped the red decor in favor of stark black 
and cream or pure cream colored wares.

THE ICA CULTURE, 1000-1470 A.D. 




690 



The craft production of the late south coast lea culture was com- 
petant but dull by comparison with the splendid art traditions that 
had preceded it. Textiles were usually ornamented with repetitive 
small figured geometric patterns and the pottery, consisting of a 
few rather elegant simple forms was decorated with the same 
motifs. Sculptured pieces were relatively rare. Our selection falls 
far short of representing all major types, but stresses the un- 
usual modeled wares.

THE INCA EMPIRE, 1470-1532 A.D. 



The far-flung Inca empire encountered by the Spaniards stretched 
from northern Ecuador southward into Chile and Argentina, a 
distance of 2500 miles. It was linked together by a vast system 
of well constructed roads and efficiently administered by a corps 
of highly trained officials. It was the most extensive and best 
organized political unit the Americas had ever seen, yet it had 
begun less than a century before the Spanish arrived, and some 
of its territories had been incorporated in the empire for a re- 
latively short time. 

The Incas' inspired leadership constituted their chief talent. They 
were not innovaters, but were quick to adopt and exploit the skills 
of the people they conquered. Their power was absolute, but just, 
and their high standards brought renewed prosperity to all parts 
of the realm.

IMPERIAL INCA ART, 1438-1532 A.D. 

The forms of Inca art were rigidly prescribed and subjected to 
exacting standards. So all-pervading was its influence that arti- 
facts of the brief period are readily identifiable wherever they 
are encountered. It is unfortunate that we were unable to arrange 
loans from the University of Cuzco Museum which has the finest 
collection of imperial Inca Art, but we have assembled a few 
outstanding examples from other sources.

PROVINCIAL INCA ART, 1470-1532 A.D. 



Though imperial Inca art is found in all parts of the empire, each 
area had its own style influenced by Inca conventions such as 
aryballoid form and flanged spout lip, but incorporating local 
traditions as well. It is symbolic of the success of the administra- 
tive policies of the Incas that these local Inca period styles 
represented a considerable revival of regional creative genius. 

THE TALLAN STYLE OF THE PIURA VALLEY 

In the Piura valley there was a revival of the use of the fine clays 
that had been an outstanding feature of Classic Vicus ceramics. 
The local style called Tallan produced some of the most colorful 
and delightful of all Inca period ceramics.
