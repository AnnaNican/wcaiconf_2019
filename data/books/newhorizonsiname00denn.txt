PREFACE AND 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 



Young talent shows, on both national and international levels, have been sporadically re- 
curring components of the Guggenheim's exhibition schedule ever since the 1950s. But not 
until Exxon assured their financial basis in 1978 did they become annual events. New 
Horizons in American Art: 1985 Exxon National Exhibition thus follows within an established 
sequence of periodic assessments in which special attention, alternately focused on the 
American and foreign cultural theaters, is given to the work of artists young in years or at 
least in reputation. Current production is thereby presented to museum visitors and, by way 
of the accompanying catalogues, to a still wider public interested in extending the radius of 
their awareness of contemporary painting and sculpture. Young American Artists (1978), 
79 Artists: Emergent Americans (1981) and New Perspectives in American Art (1983), 
punctuated during alternate years by selections of current British, Italian and Australian art, 
constitute the broad view of new talent that the Exxon contributions have opened up for the 
Guggenheim and its audience during the better part of the past decade. 

Every one of the four American exhibitions, including New Horizons in American Art, has 
displayed its own distinct character, if only because each was entrusted to a different curator 
in order to encourage changing viewpoints within an existing institutional continuity. None- 
theless, certain attributes were common to all four shows. Invariably, the search that even- 
tually resulted in a highly condensed selection required a concentrated curatorial effort: the 
sifting of hundreds of slides provided the basis for repeated visits to scores of studios, after 
which the final decisions could at last be made. Invariably also, the search itself, which 
necessarily yielded many more rejections than acceptances, encouraged the artists whether 
or not they were ultimately included, and simultaneously provided the Museum and its 
curatorial staff with firsthand information not otherwise obtainable. With respect to the final 
result, the media more often than not have found much to argue with, frequently seeking 
in these personal choices a representation of the Museum's ideological position that was 
not in the organizers' minds. It has been important to us, on the other hand, to assure for 
the Museum's permanent collection a number of annual purchases that would in time take 
their place among the valued holdings in the area of contemporary art. The Exxon grants, 
supplemented by help from other Guggenheim benefactors, have made such acquisitions 
possible, and we here express our sincere thanks for this aid. And this year there is again 
much to be grateful for to Exxon for its renewed support of this particular aspect of the 
Museum's activity. 

Lisa Dennison, who selected the nine artists represented in New Horizons in American 
Art, is following in the footsteps of others who, whether as members of the Guggenheim's 
curatorial staff or as guest curators with temporary missions, have previously carried out 
analogous tasks. It is a pleasure to acknowledge her efforts herewith and to thank those 
various staff members, singled out in Miss Dennison's prefatory remarks, who provided her 
with the necessary advice and assistance.

NEW HORIZONS IN AMERICAN ART 



by Lisa Dennison 

Across the nation, there is a resurgence of pride in America. The feelings of pride and the 
prosperity enjoyed by large segments of the population quite naturally touch many aspects 
of contemporary culture, and indeed nourish our performing arts, popular music, film, lit- 
erature and architecture. As the second half of the decade begins, the younger American 
artist, like the general public, seems to be motivated by a strong sense of national identity. 
And this sense of identity is in turn encouraging painters and sculptors to reconsider our 
national artistic heritage. 

The artist population is growing, stimulated by a greatly expanded art audience and a 
booming art market which have focused more attention on museums, galleries and auction 
houses than ever before. Nowhere is the support structure for emerging artists as strong 
as in New York. Galleries are opening at a record pace, in particular in the East Village, 
where, despite the shortcomings of small spaces and a sometimes disconcerting emphasis 
on fashion, there are now many new opportunities for artists to exhibit their work. The 
ramifications are both positive and negative: positive in that much of the work is very fresh 
and exciting; negative because artists are often showing before they have had time to 
develop a resolved body of work. Today's standards of success, fostered by an exaggerated 
star system at the top of the younger artist population, have created a complex set of 
expectations and pressures that surround the emerging artist. Indeed, in her controversial 
book Has Modernism Failed?, Suzi Gablik denounces " . . .an art world transformed beyond 
recognition by material prosperity." She claims that "success and security now play such 
a central role in the American imagination, the inducements of a conformist society are 
proving so great, that even artists have learned to strive along an imposed scale of careerist 
values, mapping out their lives like military strategists ..." and pleads for an art that can 
"reconstitute the moral will."' 

Despite the competitiveness and emphasis on achievement encountered in the current 
New York art world, the city nonetheless offers young artists a great number of opportunities 
for attaining recognition and exposure to the most avant-garde aesthetics. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that in recent years there has been a renewed influx of artists to this city, each 
of whom imports a bit of the spirit of his or her previous milieu. Though this exhibition, for 
example, appears to boast five New Yorkers, only two are natives; the other three, originating 
in California, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, and often making lengthy stops along the way, 
arrived here in 1981 and 1982. 

A wide variety of aesthetic attitudes has prevailed throughout the first half of the eighties. 
Yet the dominant style, Neo-Expressionism, is on the wane. Coming into sharper focus now 
are other forms of expression: among these, figuration, historicism, appropriation, religious 
imagery, abstraction and landscape painting all engage the attention of today's painters 
and sculptors. 

The figure, the primary vehicle of Neo-Expressionist painting, continues to be a powerful 
force, sustained by an apparently insatiable appetite for narrative content in art. It is used, 
however, in a wider range of contexts to convey meaning, to portray extremes of human 



emotion and to comment upon broad areas of contemporary culture. There has also been 
a shift from the personal mythologizmg and intense subjectivity of Neo-Expressionist paint- 
ing to a more politically and socially oriented art that maintains a dialogue between the artist 
and the powerful exterior forces that determine contemporary existence. The potent issues 
addressed range from sexuality to advanced technology to the threat of nuclear annihilation. 
Such an engagement with so many aspects of society has encouraged a style of "appro- 
priation," whereby both the images and image-making strategies draw directly from their 
sources in art history, popular culture and mass media. This idiom has a strong appeal for 
artists who reject what they consider a frustrating quest for originality. Today, appropriated 
imagery is more topical, more contextual than Pop Art and lacks the irony and wit that is 
an important aspect of the commentary made by that movement of the sixties. 

Side by side with a focus on contemporary concerns, artists express their desire to 
establish links between the past and the present and to raise psychological and spiritual 
issues. Consequently there is now a new historicizing tendency that has produced a broad 
crop of "neo-isms" since Neo-Expressionism emerged, including Primitivism, Mannerism, 
Romanticism and Surrealism. Unlike the direct borrowings or blatant quotations of appro- 
priation, the spirit of past styles is infused into the new art form, rather than copied from it. 

Religious imagery and iconography have also invaded much of contemporary art. Altar- 
pieces, reliquaries, shrines, icons and panel paintings have provided new formats which, 
when either simple and unadorned or encrusted with glitzy materials, can be intensely brutal 
or highly precious. Subject matter, from crosses and crucifixions to saints and angels, 
reinforces the religious connotations of much work today. Yet one wonders if there is indeed 
a compelling religious motivation for contemporary art. It is Gablik's belief that "... the 
essential inner attitude is missing — the devotional frame of mind. In addressing this issue, 
of the way signs of ultimate meaning have been devalued by our culture to objects of 
transitory and commercial interest. . . . that we are really addressing a much larger theme: 
the failure, in our secularized age, of the moral and religious impulse. . . . " 2 Whether or not 
the author is right in doubting the sincerity of religious symbols and iconography in current 
art, there definitely is a renewed quest for the expression of spirituality in all genres. Fig- 
uration, landscape and abstraction are vehicles today, as they have been throughout history, 
to express this condition. What is unique now is the increasingly urgent desire to convey 
spirituality in such a variety of contexts. 

Currently, abstraction is steadfastly and intelligently holding its own amidst the barrage 
of figuration, with the organic mode prevailing over the geometric. Despite the stylistic 
diversity within abstraction, there are some common traits that lend a new vitality to the 
genre. Small scale, which can impart a concentrated density, impact and energy to the 
work, is gaining currency among both abstract and representational artists. The Utopian 
vision and reductive modes of the abstract painters and sculptors who emerged in the mid- 
sixties have inspired succeeding generations. However, in keeping with a general trend in 
today's art, younger artists are emphasizing more narrative content in abstraction. They are 



stressing a connection with the real world and are extending allusions, symbols and references. 

Painting is the medium of the moment. Though many artists are working in sculptural 
idioms, there is a preponderance of work that is either wall-related or installation-oriented 
or that incorporates both painting and sculpture and can thus be defined as neither. However, 
painting itself is becoming more sculptural, more object-like. As the scale of much painting 
becomes smaller, artists more frequently frame their works, thus enhancing their object- 
like quality. Additionally, artists are turning to less traditional materials and using encaustics, 
plaster and collage elements to build out the surfaces of the paintings to the point where 
some become high reliefs. For many artists, paint on canvas is no longer enough; their 
forays into more sculptural concerns have encouraged them to work freely in both mediums. 

There is one particular tendency in contemporary American art that deserves to be high- 
lighted. Landscape painting is gaining momentum from coast to coast, and it is worthwhile 
to examine some of the possible causes behind this phenomenon. In general, traditions 
and values that are deep rooted in American society and culture have gained new relevance 
for today's artists. Their attitude is an outgrowth not only of the new positive spirit and sense 
of confidence in America, but perhaps also of the conservative political climate of the past 
five years. It may be propelled as well by the precedent set by the younger generation of 
European artists that came to our attention in the late seventies and early eighties: the 
Italian Transavanguardia and the German Neo-Expressionists draw much of their inspiration 
from the past. For the Italians, their cultural and artistic heritage is inextricably wedded to 
the present; it is an inescapable part of the environment and education of the artist. As 
Diane Waldman wrote in the introduction to the catalogue for the 1982 Exxon exhibition 
/fa//ar? Art Now: An American Perspective, "The recovery of myth, the symbolic meaning 
in performance ... the renewed preoccupation with alchemy are fundamental to even the 
sparest form of expression in recent Italian art. These concerns, deep rooted in the Italian 
heritage and imagination, are neither integral to our [American] culture nor germane to our 
history and, thus, are not central to our art." 3 The concerns of the German Neo-Expres- 
sionists are also grounded in their past — in art, culture, mythology, history and politics, 
and the way that history in particular is transmitted and interpreted. 

Because myth and allegory, which have nourished so much European art, are not a part 
of the heritage of the American artist, the myths and symbols in much of our Neo-Expres- 
sionist painting become so disconnected from their sources that the meanings of the works 
themselves are drained of their power. Many artists are now seeking to substitute for sym- 
bolism a more concrete and tangible reality. What sort of inspiration, then, can American 
artists derive from the past? America's history is about its frontier, its enormous land. Its 
monuments are its natural wonders — the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Great Lakes, 
the vast forests, mountain ranges, prairies and deserts. Turning to the past or facing the 
present, the prominence of our landscape is inescapable. 

In the nineteenth century, this immense horizon became the horizon of American art; 
landscape painting was the major innovation of that period. Through a portrayal of the 



10 



vastness and grandeur, the isolated, moody and often lonely aspects of nature, landscape 
painting addressed spiritual ideas. It became the prime outlet for a romantic sensibility, 
which was linked to the European Romantic tradition. Also embodied in the concept of 
Romanticism was man's search for meaning and identity within the greatness and sublimity 
of his surroundings. Thus, from the heroic vision and sweeping vistas of the Hudson River 
School to the ensuing mysticism of the Luminists. landscape painting encompassed not 
only the observation of nature but also drama, poetry, metaphysics and morality. 

The notion of nature as a source of spiritual experience became more objectified and 
universal in the early twentieth century. Among the early modernists in America, Marsden 
Hartley, Arthur Dove and Georgia O'Keeffe found in European antecedents a source for 
their own expression. They saw nature as vibrant, alive and immediate, and sought to 
represent it in organic terms. Their reduction and indeed distillation of nature resulted in 
shapes that were highly abstracted from the literal images, yet retentive of vestiges of the 
original forms. Throughout succeeding decades, landscape continued to serve as a point 
of departure for abstraction. Although the locus of inspiration for Abstract Expressionism 
lay in the unconscious, the imagery ultimately suggests landscape. Robert Rosenblum has 
traced the linkages between the Northern European Romantic tradition and Abstract 
Expressionism, stating, for example, that "the genealogical table that can be constructed 
for the erratic configurations and gigantic scale of Still's paintings would seem to lead back 
through the history of Romantic landscape painting. The situation is also the same for much 
of the work of Jackson Pollock, whose images, like Still's, may be abstract but nevertheless 
elicit metaphors within a range of natural, organic phenomena. ..."' The identification with 
nature felt by the Earthworks artists took them from the studio into the actual physical 
landscape: the earth was their palette. Though the finite object and accessibility to the 
viewer were sacrificed, nature became form, medium, content and place for these artists. 4 

We are now at a point where landscape has reclaimed many of its traditional meanings 
and values for younger artists. Landscape today elicits a variety of attitudes and is treated 
in a wide range of styles, mediums and formats. It can be perceived or remembered, top- 
ographical or imaginary. It can be nostalgic, dreamlike, otherworldly or visionary. It can 
evoke the idea or sensation of landscape without having the look of landscape. 

Artists today are not painting America, but their work draws its strength from America. 
The physical qualities of the environment, native traditions and beliefs and contemporary 
culture are inspiring forces for artists now. Throughout the country, artists echo a similar 
refrain: it speaks of the traditional American desire to represent a sense of place. A "place" 
is the product of an encounter between the artist and his or her surroundings. The process 
of experiencing deeply is the catalyst that transforms any physical location into a place. To 
claim a place as his or her own, the artist must isolate the particular qualities of the encounter 
and express them through the medium of art. 

The contemporary artist's concern with place may be symptomatic of the feared loss of 
human values in our increasingly technologized and depersonalized society. In dealing with 



11 



landscape and the natural world, the artist can assert the value of those things in ourselves 
and in our environment that we risk losing. In the past few years, there have been many 
exhibitions devoted to the theme of the apocalypse. 6 If apocalyptic painting portended the 
end of the world, paintings that invoke "place" would seem to make a more affirmative 
statement about the possibility of restoring human values and the sanctity of our environ- 
ment. Further, there appears to be a desire on the part of many artists to make a distinction 
between real and fictive (for example, television and movie) spaces. The flimsiness and 
vulgarity of the shopping malls and fast-food chains that have claimed so much of our 
environment have sparked a yearning for genuine and enduring objects and experiences. 

Artists' engagement with landscape today may also be due to its capacity to mediate 
between figurative and abstract tendencies. With the figurative impulse so strong in art now, 
artists may be reluctant to relinquish imagery drawn from the real world. Landscape retains 
tangible references to reality, yet is an ideal conveyance of abstraction. Thus, younger 
artists are continuing the historical dialogue between abstraction and landscape, and in so 
doing, they establish the parentage of the early American modernists. 

The association of artists today with the Romantic tradition may also account for the 
current appeal of landscape. As mentioned above, one facet of Romanticism is the notion 
of man's search for identity. Equally important, perhaps, is the focus of Romanticism on 
emotional content. The themes of the spiritual landscape and human emotional drama that 
intrigued the painters of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have a renewed appeal 
for younger artists. Using imagery pertinent to our own time, they have revitalized Roman- 
ticism to express spirituality and emotional content in their art. 

Four of the nine artists in this exhibition work in a landscape tradition that looks back to 
our American heritage but at the same time is responsive to the mood of the present. Though 
the paintings of Tobi Kahn, Rex Lau, Mark Innerst and Joan Nelson are highly individual in 
mood and meaning, they have in common a departure from more traditional mediums (oil 
or acrylic on canvas) and their work draws strength and beauty from their technical inno- 
vations. Additionally, all four artists speak of their desire to articulate, often metaphorically, 
their intensely personal feelings about nature, reality and art. While others among the group 
do not work specifically within a landscape genre, they do touch upon aspects of natural 
phenomena: the organic forms in Phoebe Adams's sculpture draw direct inspiration from 
nature; Mark Kloth has spoken of his abstract installations as landscapes; and Irene Pijoan's 
primordial figures either literally emerge from stone or are set within highly abstracted land- 
scapes. Jim Peters's figures project a mood of deep introspection and are situated in intri- 
guing and ambiguous interior spaces, and Anthony-Peter Gorny's photographs explore both 
the real world and the world of the imagination: although their work reveals approaches 
different from those of the other seven artists, it is equally compelling in its expression of 
the universal, the timeless and the metaphysical. 

Tobi Kahn received his initial training in photography, and perhaps it is this grounding that 
has enriched his admirable ability to select, order and crop his landscape images until they 



12 



take on a compositional "Tightness ." Working from photographs or from memory, the artist 
strips landscape to its essential core so that it evokes place, always serene and meditative, 
yet also serves as a vehicle for abstraction. These landscapes are about form, color, texture, 
mood; in them, little attention is paid to topographical detail or description. Intuitive adjust- 
ments of forms from smaller to larger scale, and the fluent draftsmanship that defines the 
contours of these forms assure that the works are experienced as deeply by the viewer as 
they are felt by the artist. Gently rolling hills, bulbous or sharply peaked mountains, triangular 
or trapezoidal patches of sea, serpentine rivers and roads are powerful shapes which tightly 
interlock on the surface of the canvas. As shapes, they are at once abstract and archetypal, 
yet in the context of the whole, there is no mistaking their relationship to forms in the natural 
world. 

The ambiguity between abstraction and representation is deliberately cultivated by Kahn. 
The artist is, in fact, a master at subverting traditional expectations. Horizon lines seem to 
sit on the same plane as foreground forms; roads that recede in a Munchian fashion do not 
create the illusion of deep space; bright colors, which usually move forward, are used in 
backgrounds. Color does not conform to its expected associations either, causing us to 
wonder, for example, if the curving pink path in Azba II (cat. no. 29) is a river or a road, an 
enigma that remains unsolved. 

Though the aforementioned pictorial devices may seem to emphasize the paintings' flat- 
ness, this flatness is subverted by a pronounced sculptural quality. The artist's technique 
enhances this volumetric sensation: Kahn prepares his ground with a chalky white acrylic 
polymer, which gives the works a built-up, toothy surface texture. By working his paint in 
one direction up to the boundary of the next form, the artist creates a sculptural ridge which 
simultaneously reinforces the integrity of that form and makes it more volumetric. The frames, 
too, which are conceived as part of the work and are painted in a dark hue that relates to 
the tonalities of the compositions, stress the works' plastic dimension. 

Kahn is a student of Josef Albers's color theories; he believes in the master's statement 
that "In visual perception a color is almost never seen as it really is — as it physically is. 
This fact makes color the most relative medium in art." 7 The manipulation of color for Kahn 
is a deliberate and thoughtful process; the expressive power and poetry of the paintings 
emanate first and foremost from the gentle pulsation of his exquisite close-valued hues. 
The artist painstakingly layers his pigment, working from dark to light or light to dark, some- 
times creating opaque areas of dark colors which are then successively lightened, and 
sometimes rubbing black into lighter zones to impart a resonance and depth. Elsewhere, 
areas of thinly applied washes retain an ethereal translucency. Color is not localized: one 
hue may be subtly rubbed into a neighboring area to reinforce the essential harmony of the 
whole. More recently, the artist has used metallic pigments that allude to natural ores or 
imitate the effect of sunlight on water: these range from golden and coppery earth tones 
to silvery whites and blues to shimmering greens and rich scarlets. Though there is no 
discernible light source in Kahn's works, there is a magical interior luminosity that emanates 



13 



from the white ground and is enhanced by the delicate translucency of his veils of color. 

Sculpture is a natural outgrowth of Kahn's concern with plasticity in his paintings. The 
paintings from the late seventies and early eighties are often so compact and boxy that 
they straddle the line between painting, sculpture and object. Recently, the artist arrived at 
a means of unleashing some of the power and intensity of these works by enlarging his 
scale and by conceiving of sculpture as separate from painting. The sculpture is at its most 
potent in a series of wooden shrines that house smaller figurative statues, as in Brun (cat. 
no. 30). Kahn speaks of searching for contemporary equivalents to ancestral religious shrines 
in these works, and in their nonspecificity and haunting mysticality they communicate with 
the viewer on a spiritual level. 

Like Arthur Dove, whom he greatly admires, Kahn has sought to transcend the temporal 
in his work. He, too, strives to transform nature so that it reflects a spiritual state of mind, 
and in so doing he equivocates between abstraction and reality. Kahn also draws inspiration 
from the formal qualities of the work of the American modernists: one is reminded of Hartley's 
Maine seascapes, in particular the way his ocean and rock configurations interlock; or of 
Dove's organic shapes which fill their shallow landscape background; or of O'Keeffe's con- 
centration on the sensual in elemental natural forms, her celebration of the land as its own 
monument, possessed of an inner pulse. There are strong affinities, too, with Milton Avery's 
eloquent and lyrical landscapes of the fifties, which approach abstraction in their spare, 
simplified forms, elegant line and soft and harmonious palette. Kahn acknowledges other 
important influences as well: Alberto Giacometti, whose exaggerated attenuations of figures 
have affected his own expressive distortions of nature; and the contemporary sculptor Martin 
Puryear, whose reductivist aesthetic, organic forms and subtle handling of color he admires. 

Rex Lau's vision, like Tobi Kahn's, is rooted in nature. Though on the surface Lau's stately 
images seem emblematic — unspecific and generalized — they are in fact explicit forms 
based on the artist's observations of his surroundings in Montauk, on the eastern tip of Long 
Island. One critic relates his discussions with Lau regarding the genesis of the subject 
matter: "The image for The Wind Demons [see cat. no. 42], for instance, came when he 
looked out his window during a storm and saw a cedar tree bowing in the gale. He noted 
that the wind was so fierce that it wouldn't allow the tree to spring out of its bend, in effect 
'freezing' it in its torturous position. It was an epiphanic image, one that burned into his 
mind and which he heightened into a compelling emblem through planar simplification and 
a hieratically presented doubling.' " 8 

The boulders that make up Montauk's dramatic coastline, the peaks of waves and the 
barren trees of winter are images drawn from Lau's environment. These subjects, explored 
singly and in combinations, are stripped to their essence and give structure to the work. 
Repetition of forms, sensitivity to cropping and edge, an insistent frontality and luminous, 
nondescriptive color catapult these paintings into the realm of abstraction. 

The solid, sculptural quality of Lau's paintings is owed in part to the material upon which 
they are executed: carved Hydro-stone bestows an actual three-dimensionality and weight 



14 



on his forms. This jagged and irregular shallow relief is particularly appropriate to the imagery 
of craggy rocks and spiky, menacing trees. Enhancing the works' sculpturality is the elab- 
orate facture of the surfaces: tiny incisions, crosshatchings and other scarring in the Hydro- 
stone create a compelling immediacy, and also absorb and refract light as it dances across 
these enlivened planes. Pushed up to the surface to claustrophobic effect, Lau's forms 
confront the viewer head-on. Though Lau does not frame his works, he often creates a 
framelike border that is either explicit or suggested by the edges of his forms, as in Cape 
Fear and the Deep in the Forest series (cat. nos. 43, 47, 48). These "frames" have an 
important function in terms of restoring a spatiality that is threatened by the forceful forward 
movement of the imagery. 

Lau applies his oil paint in layers, sometimes blending and subtly modulating them, some- 
times retaining a lively brushy quality. In works such as Leaping Without Looking (cat. no. 
46). color is highly saturated. In others, for example Deep in the Forest II (cat. no. 48), Lau 
exploits complementary contrasts of red and green so that each vibrates intensely. And 
where color is subtle and low-keyed, as in Petrified Forest (cat. no. 45), it projects a quiet, 
introspective mood. Lau's forms, though compressed, breathe color and light, like Monet's 
haystacks. His work speaks of color as derived from, but ultimately independent of, nature. 
Through Lau's paintings we share his understanding of the powerful sensations that lib- 
erated color can provoke as optical phenomenon and physical sensation. 

By working in what can loosely be defined as series, Lau is free to explore the shifts in 
meaning, mood and psychological impact created by changes in form, palette and com- 
position. The different pairings of trees in the various versions of The Wind Demons and 
Deep in the Forest, for example, impart to the works an air of fantasy and mystery that 
recalls Metaphysical and Surrealist painting. A similar effect occurs in certain works by 
Kahn, such as Azin I (cat. no. 25). Though neither artist juxtaposes unrelated objects, their 
tree and mountain forms can have a figural presence, a persona that recalls the allusions 
of inanimate forms to human beings in paintings by de Chirico and Magritte. Shifts in palette 
also suggest shifts in time of day, ranging from bright and revealing daylight to mysterious 
and romantic night. The sinister quality of the green and orange sawtooth-edged trees in 
The Wind Demons is tempered in other versions executed in soft, pastel tones of lavenders 
against pink, for example. On the other hand, in Untitled Seascape (Large Pink Wave) (cat. 
no. 44), rendering the sharp, pointed crests of waves in a candied pink does little to mitigate 
the implication of nature's annihilating powers. What this proves is that there are no formulas 
to be applied here — the emotional expression of each work results entirely from the inter- 
action of that particular combination of elements. 

Like Kahn, Lau is concerned with essences and distillations. He, too, shares a spiritual 
kinship with Hartley and Dove. In particular, Hartley's strongly colored bulky forms with their 
ragged edges seem to have inspired Lau. And Dove's deep feelings about nature as the 
wellspring of his images are undoubtedly shared by the young artist. Though Lau's obser- 
vations of nature are extremely personal, their universal qualities are unmistakable. His 



15 



simultaneous truth to nature and to painting is a rare accomplishment that enriches our 
viewing experience. 

Joan Nelson's stark and haunting landscapes are reductive in color and imagery, yet rich 
in nuance and poetry. Unlike Kahn and Lau, Nelson does not strip nature to its essences, 
nor does she celebrate the inherent beauty of forms in the natural world. Her spare com- 
positions emanate a profound sense of desolation; there is an unsettling and inexplicable 
emptiness in these unpeopled environments. 

In 1984, the artist abandoned oil on canvas for egg tempera on plaster or Masonite. 
Though tempera is not a medium used widely by contemporary artists, Nelson has been 
able to coax great subtlety and refinement from this technique by building up thin layers of 
wash. Smooth and glistening white gesso underpainting and the irregular and wavy surface 
of a thin layer of plaster provide grounds on which the artist glazes a narrow but exceedingly 
rich range of monochromatic pigments. A close study of these colors reveals blacks, ochers, 
sepias and rich sienas, and surprising blushes of pinks or oranges in the mottled skies. 
Nelson recently has expanded her palette to include a pale and ethereal turquoise blue 
which reads as a diaphanous film in paintings such as Untitled (cat. no. 56). In 1985, Nelson 
also began using encaustic, either inlaying solid-colored wax to "draw" the image, or ap- 
plying alternating layers of wax and oil paint until the image emerged in its final state. The 
surface quality of the wax, uneven and sometimes pitted or scarred, renders these easel- 
scale paintings tactile and sensuous. 

Architecture is the primary subject of these "scapes." Nelson is not concerned with de- 
scriptive detail, but rather with the formal properties of her subjects and the sensations that 
her minimal and poetic renditions of them evoke. Though the artist generally eschews 
identifying architectural features, the volumes of her forms are often inobtrusively punc- 
tuated by windows, chimneys, balconies and stairways. Nelson's settings are unlocalized 
and isolated from particular contexts. They range from the type of place one might encounter 
in a dream, to images that have a more striking familiarity yet elude definition. The artist 
paints from her imagination, from reality and from photographs, rearranging her sources to 
remove them from the realm of specificity. What is conveyed are generic subjects: we may 
think of barns, industrial buildings, dwellings and walls. Beyond that, the mystery remains. 
The articulation of these forms when transferred into paint is the only reality that ultimately 
concerns us. 

The absence of people in these barren environments raises ominous questions, prompt- 
ing one critic to see the works as having an apocalyptic message. 9 This is perhaps an 
unintended result, not a direct aim of the artist. What seems more important is the concern 
with the simultaneous beauty and ugliness of manmade forms in our environment. Nelson 
approaches her compositions like an abstract painter, setting up a series of formal problems 
which she resolves in the working process. Many of the paintings are extremely minimal in 
their imagery; the artist thus focuses our attention on the juncture of ground and sky, on 
the volumes and angularities of the forms or on the arrangement of lights and darks. In 



16 



others, the creation of a deep space through geometric and perspectival devices is a primary 
concern Nelson's structures are rarely depicted frontally; most often, our perspective is 
from above or below, and the buildings are sited so that we read the corner intersection of 
their two faces rather than their facades. Buildings often jut into the picture plane as dra- 
matically foreshortened wedge-shaped volumes, so that the orthogonal lines of their top 
and bottom edges converge at a vanishing point on the horizon. Indeed, these exaggerated 
raking diagonals, defined by buildings, roads, walls, telephone poles or railway tracks, have 
become a hallmark of the artist's style. 

Like the work of the Precisionist painters Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, Nelson's 
architectural landscapes are realistic at base, but controlled by geometric simplification and 
stripped of detail to the point where they become abstract in their impact. Yet Nelson infuses 
her paintings with a warmth and surface richness that removes them from a Precisionist 
aesthetic. We are also reminded of Edward Hopper's depictions of urban and rural America, 
and the silence, detachment and loneliness they exude. The essentially geometric organ- 
ization of his picture planes, his sensitivity to light and the static quality of his images find 
parallels in Nelson's art. However, the poetic evocations of Nelson's mysterious universe, 
and the intermingling of dream and memory with reality are uniquely her own. 

The exquisite landscape paintings of Mark Innerst convey great power and intensity on 
a diminutive scale. The specificity of the images he chooses to record contrasts sharply 
with the unnamed places in Nelson's world. Even his titles reinforce this particulanzation: 
Brooklyn Seen from the East River Park or The Mississippi (New Orleans, LA). Innerst 
either culls his sublets from photographs of his environment — such as the central Penn- 
sylvania landscape of his youth, or the view from his East Village rooftop — or appropriates 
them from sources as diverse as television, medical journals, issues of National Geographic 
and dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History. Though they often retain the 
look of their photographic sources, the paintings are not meant only to be representations 
of external reality; on the contrary, in their complex layering of both technique and meaning, 
they consistently transcend mere observation. 

In the work of Kahn. Lau and Nelson, landscape, while an end in itself, also serves as a 
point of departure for abstract invention. This dialogue between representation and abstrac- 
tion is present in Innerst's paintings as well, but instead of progressing from realistic to more 
abstract, universal images, he reverses the process. His intricate working method entails 
laying an acrylic ground of one saturated color or a geometric pattern of several colors. He 
then builds up layers of translucent oil glaze to achieve a high degree of finish that recalls 
the look of the photographic source. Though the underpaintmg is for the most part obscured, 
portions are allowed to remain visible as specific forms, patches of color or brilliant strips 
of light in the completed work. This separation of form and color refers to the mechanical 
process of printmakmg, a medium in which the artist has been trained. 

Innerst constructs elaborate frames for his works, sometimes incorporating fragments of 
old frames or moldings. These frames, which the artist considers part of the works, often 



17 



double the pieces' sizes. They are not merely artistic conceits; rather, they further develop 
the associations of the images, echoing and enriching the temperament of the works. As 
one critic has written, they "limit the works and reinforce their evocative isolation, diminishing 
them in scale, serving to make them, like Cornellian boxes, places of reverie and contem- 
plation, defined spaces of magic."' 

Innerst imbues even the most banal subject with drama and exoticism. Confronted by 
Brooklyn Seen from the East River Park (cat. no. 24), we might think we are viewing one 
of Canaletto's Venetian scenes rather than the bland industrial horizon of Brooklyn's riv- 
erfront. The expressive painterliness, the intense and fiery orange light, passionate color, 
low horizons and awe-inspiring skies conjure up mystical and otherworldly associations that 
make Innerst an indisputable heir to the Romantic tradition. Moreover, the air of nostalgia 
and threat of change or impending disaster that we perceive in certain works, even the 
gruesome imagery in Untitled (Miscreant) and the landscape of skulls and bones in Cat- 
acomb (cat. nos. 18, 20), refer as well to nineteenth-century Romantic attitudes toward 
nature. 

Yet this work is a curious hybrid of many Romantic sources. Innerst draws upon elements 
of the European Romantic tradition, encompassing, for example, the Barbizon School paint- 
ers' direct study of nature and Corot's more poetic approach. One also sees a fusion of the 
Hudson River School painters' romantic realism based on nature with the Luminists' con- 
centration on the descriptive and expressive qualities of light. There is a pronounced Amer- 
ican quality to Innerst's penchant for flat landscapes with low horizon lines and palpable 
light that recall the work of Sanford Robinson Gifford, John Frederick Kensett and Fitz Hugh 
Lane. In particular, the subjective and dreamlike expression of George Inness's visionary 
landscapes, his intimate conception of nature, painterly handling of form and intensity of 
hue seem pertinent, as do Martin Johnson Heade's highly charged nocturnal skies. 

Innerst makes references to his sources with great deliberateness; indeed this intentional 
historicizing seems part of the cultivated artifice of the whole. But these allusions are sincere, 
stemming from a deeply personal response to his subjects. The artist does not dilute the 
power of his sources by working in a diminutive scale; rather, he reconciles a heroic and 
epic quality with the intimacy and poetry of his own vision. 

Figuration in contemporary art resembles landscape painting in its diversity and the 
extreme degree to which the artists' emotions are a shaping force in the creative process. 
Both Jim Peters and Irene Pijoan employ the figure and place it in narrative contexts that 
are ambiguous and enigmatic, but tantalizingly real. 

Jim Peters s work keeps its meanings mysteriously uncertain through an unusual mixture 
of imagery drawn from the realms of reality and dreams. His private interior landscapes are 
tinged with eroticism and unexplained tensions between male and female. These deeply 
psychological themes center around the image of the female, whom the artist seems to 
view with both sympathy and antipathy. In Against the Grid and Night Cottage (cat. nos. 
61 , 62), it appears that the naked female is being cruelly punished, pressed up against the 



18 



cold tile wall. Yet In Doxology (cat. no. 63) the suggestion of a halo above the still naked 
female's head hints at her deification. Peters insets smaller and equally ambiguous narrative 
panels within many of the larger works. This dislocation of scale is discontinuous with the 
imagery as a whole, and further confounds its meaning. We wonder, for example, whether 
the panel at the bottom left in Untitled (Reclining Figure) (cat. no. 65) depicts a view into 
another room, or provides a clue to the cause of the terrified look on the woman's face. 
Through the use of plexiglass panels Peters increases the tension and erotic, dreamlike 
associations of the works. Painted on both sides and affixed to portions of the canvas, they 
function as windows and thereby add a voyeuristic note, making us feel as if we have gained 
access to a scene that we were not intended to witness. 

Though Peters is allusive in his imagery, he is extremely direct in his technique. His 
paintings frequently incorporate collaged objects, ranging from photographs (often the same 
one is used in different paintings) that either retain their integrity or are painted over, to bits 
of wood, tin and other detritus the artist scavenges in Provincetown. An old sink cover 
becomes a powerful framing element in Against the Grid, and Untitled (Reclining Figure) 
is painted on a splayed shower stall. Often Peters paints on small panels which he then 
groups together to form the final image of the work: this accounts for the irregular contours 
and unusual surfaces of certain pieces and, in some cases, for the dislocations of meaning 
as well. Found objects have also inspired three-dimensional compositions, such as Decision 
and Summer (cat. nos. 59, 60), that are highly simple and direct, yet instilled with the same 
mystery as the monumental paintings. 

Peters frequently uses a triptych arrangement, whose associative link with altarpieces 
cannot be coincidental. Religious undercurrents are found throughout Peters's oeuvre, in 
the contemporary altarpiece format of Untitled (Reclining Figure) — whose subject also 
reminds us of a reclining Buddha; in the modern-day angel as well as the very title of 
Doxology; and in the strange resemblance to a confessional of the enclosure at the lower 
right in The Gift (cat. no. 64). A crucifixion image occurs in a different version of Against 
the Grid and An Italian Honeymoon can be interpreted as a contemporary rendition of the 
Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. 

In paintings such as Doxology we can find references to a few of the many artists Peters 
admires: the decorative tracery of railings against flat planes of color recalls Henri Matisse, 
and the architectonic color structure is reminiscent of Richard Diebenkorn. Though their 
explicit detail and shock effect is relatively reduced, many of Peters's works bring to mind 
the tableaux of Edward Kienholz. Peters's agglomeration of materials from the everyday 
world onto the surfaces of the canvases, and his use of the connotative powers of these 
materials to heighten the meanings of his narratives, certainly hark back to Kienholz's 
chillingly real constructions. Perhaps most important to Peters is the work of Gregory Gil- 
lespie, the American artist whose painstakingly executed realistic paintings possess an 
intense visionary quality. Gillespie's clarity of detail and method of setting elaborate mini- 
ature panels into the surfaces of his paintings have parallels in Peters's work. Further, the 



19 



dreamlike narratives of figures engaged in disquieting confrontations, the unresolved ten- 
sions and the mood of religious allegory are similarly invoked by the younger artist. 

Like Jim Peters, Irene Pijoan depicts private and ambiguous narratives that center on the 
human figure. She has experimented with a wide range of styles and techniques, beginning 
with nestlike sculptures constructed of found objects and progressing to plaster-covered 
pillow sculptures, to expressionistic figurative paintings on abstract shaped pieces of styro- 
foam and later to sculpture in stone, bronze and wax, often embedded with high- or low- 
relief portraits modeled in encaustic. Most recently, the artist has synthesized many of these 
approaches in a striking group of encaustic-relief and oil paintings that draw on both the 
physical immediacy and power of her sculpture and the sensuality, drama and lyricism of 
her paintings. 

The human figure first entered Pijoan's art in the guise of portraiture. Working from pho- 
tographs of herself and of close friends, in these pieces the artist alternates between a 
fresco technique and a modeled-encaustic relief which is sometimes affixed to stone. The 
portraits are rooted in direct, intent observation of the external person. This exterior may 
be subject to expressive deformation: in works such as House Guest (cat. no. 67), Man- 
neristic distortions are applied in the physiognomic rendenng. Yet Pijoan infuses her figures 
with a melodramatic quality as well, so as to emphasize isolation and emotional introspec- 
tiveness. In accordance with her belief that "a face is merely a shell encompassing a million 
thoughts past and future,"" Pijoan imbues these portraits with great psychological depth. 

The artist extended many of the concerns addressed in the portraits in a series of more 
vigorously modeled figures set within exotic and vague terrains. Earth tones make up the 
overall palette of these pieces, and the irregular surfaces, built up with plaster, are lush and 
painterly. The works conjure up strong primordial associations, which are enhanced by the 
primitively carved, bald and naked figures crouched in animalistic poses. The fetal-like 
positions of the figures and the human forms emerging from stone in such works as Mes- 
opotamia and Streams (cat. nos. 69, 70) evoke images of birth and raise questions about 
mans origins. 

Primitivism is deliberately cultivated by the artist, who speaks of her love of paleolithic 
art, in particular the cave paintings, which hold a special fascination for her. It is not sur- 
prising, then, that her enigmatic narratives have the ritualistic overtones that are associated 
with much prehistoric and primitive art, and that the irregular surfaces of her canvases recall 
the uneven topography of ancient cave walls. 

In recent works such as Glacier and Ransom Earth (cat. nos. 71, 72), precisely carved, 
luminous encaustic figures rise in relief from rich grounds of plaster and oil paint. The figural 
elements are hauntingly real as they extend into our domain, yet they are otherworldly and 
ethereal, too. The pale, translucent surfaces of their flesh palpitate with life, and indeed 
become the focal points of the compositions. In Glacier, the highly finished figure is sus- 
pended in a no-man's land between heaven and earth This figure s polished surface creates 
a vital tension with the rawness of the environment and the cruder carving of the other 



20 



figures. Whereas the earlier portraits achieved their expressivity through distortions of fea- 
tures and mien, the full figures, though faceless, are equally expressive in their contorted 
and balletic poses. 

Italian art, from the frescoes at Pompeii to the paintings of the Italian Primitives to the 
Renaissance and Mannerist periods, has provided considerable inspiration for the artist. 
Ransom Earth, like many of Pijoan's works, recalls Giotto in its narrative power, depiction 
of space, the strength and simplicity of the highly plastic forms and the serene mood. Indeed, 
the finely executed Leonardesque figure in the upper right acts in counterpoint to the pre- 
dominant Italian Primitive style of the piece. A similar drawing style prevails in Church and 
Stale (cat. no. 73), and its rich red tonalities evoke the Pompeian frescoes that the artist 
has seen on several trips to Italy. 

The undefined grounds in Pijoan's work lack even so much as references to architecture, 
natural landmarks or any other signs that would give us a clue to time or place. As one critic 
has noted, these works illuminate "states" rather than events. 12 States of being or becom- 
ing, states recalling primitive existence in their emotional urgency, states that relate to inner 
experience and memory are the focus of this artist's imagination and creativity. 

All the artists discussed so far have in some way explored the boundaries between 
painting and sculpture. Phoebe Adams is a sculptor, and though her works seem to indicate 
painterly concerns — in their relationship to the wall, suggestion of calligraphic drawing and 
richly colored patinas — they remain strictly in the realm of sculpture in their conception and 
realization. 

In this decade, the rich tradition of bronze sculpture has provided new impetus for many 
artists. Their search for an expanded range of materials has brought sculptors to reconsider 
the time-honored medium of bronze and to seek ways of investing it with a new vitality. In 
keeping with recent expressionist tendencies in art, sculptors have exploited bronze for the 
expressive possibilities of its form, color and surface texture. Phoebe Adams is one of a 
small number of artists who work exclusively in bronze. In her exploration of the medium, 
she has developed fresh and captivating forms and patinas. Her works are all unique casts, 
and each investigates a new and different set of challenges that she creates for herself. 

Adams's work is abundant in references to the real world, especially to organic and 
biomorphic forms and natural phenomena and processes. Allusions to amoebas and the 
undersea world in trailing tentacles and fronds, to flora and fauna in such works as Pointed 
Trap (cat. no. 1 ), to the flow of water in Headlong Fall, to human organisms and body parts 
in The Nerve Cell and / Can Fear That, Too attest to the works' relationship with the natural 
world. At the same time, however, the pieces are abstract and metaphoric, suggesting 
movement and states of being — opening and closing, sprouting and growing, orbiting and 
gyrating. 

The wall is an essential counterpoint to Adams's forms, and the relationship of the sculp- 
ture to this vertical surface receives vigilant attention. In many works, the point of attachment 
is a primary consideration: the orbit of The World (cat. no. 5), for example, begins and ends 



21 



with the light lapis-colored ball on the wall. This anchor point is all the more important 
because it keeps in check the floating impression created by the piece. Whereas some 
works seem buoyant, others obey the laws of gravity in their orientation. The wall also 
provides a backdrop for the play of shadows; it is activated by these distorted echoes of 
the sculptures' protruding elements. 

Like free-standing sculpture, this work addresses traditional problems of volume, mass, 
balance and proportion. It intrudes into the viewer's space not by sitting on the floor but by 
projecting from the wall, declaring itself emphatically, at first frontally, and then more coyly 
in its irresistible invitation to peer around and within. The artist is extremely sensitive to the 
twists and turns of forms, to angles of projection, to the views of the inside or underneath. 

Adams enlivens her sculptures with a range of variegated colors and textures achieved 
in the casting, chasing and patination processes. She endows some works with a bumpy 
and prickly skin (cat. nos. 4, 9), whereas others are stippled or corrugated (cat. nos. 5, 6). 
The combination of these different textures in the same piece is provocative and inspired. 
Half Laugh (cat. no. 6), for example, sports a pleated upper portion, a midsection that is 
activated by closely packed ridges and a flatter yet subtly modulated lower section that 
recalls the time-worn surface textures of antique artifacts. Indeed, many of the patinas 
generate such archaeological associations. The astounding array of colors the artist achieves 
is, for the most part, that traditionally obtained from bronze, though imbued with great depth, 
complexity and nuance. Golds, greens, turquoises, blacks and rusts predominate. Even the 
surprising reds and whites do not seem artificial, owing partly to the fact that these colors 
are found in the material and not applied to it. Though Adams's work may call to mind Nancy 
Graves's polychromed bronzes, it is very different. Adams does not polychrome her pieces, 
and her hues are rich and deep in contrast to Graves's strident colors. Additionally, Adams 
casts her sculptures whole or in sections, whereas Graves's process is additive, involving 
the agglomeration of casts of found objects and plant materials to form the final image. 

Adams's oeuvre comprises a range of classical to baroque (or what the artist has called 
"eccentric") forms and colors. Songbird (cat. no. 2), for example, recalls a Greek amphora 
in its shape. The reverse "S" curve of this work has an elegant sway, an exaggerated 
contrapposto that is echoed in Half Laugh. The "eccentric" works are often tougher and 
less lyrical; for their impact they depend on spiky and jagged forms, quivering drawings in 
space and great loops of bronze that thrust out from the wall. Whether flat or three-dimen- 
sional, geometric or organic, angular or rounded, the parts of each sculpture are artfully 
orchestrated to achieve a lively rhythm and graceful fluidity. 

Mark Kloth gathers found objects and materials into environmental installations that are 
at once dramatic, spiritual and contemplative. His alteration of his spaces is total, incor- 
porating painting, drawing and light, so that the sum of the piece transcends the meaning 
of the parts. Kloth's background is in performance art, and the theatrical nature of the 
medium is indeed brought to bear in his installations — in their staging, lighting and manip- 
ulation of space. 



22 



In his earliest work, Kloth explored the notion that creative activities and processes focus 
attention on the artist. Physical participation in the work was a responsibility that Kloth 
transferred from himself to the viewer when he began creating installations. The viewer's 
participation — entering and moving through and around the piece — was vital to experi- 
encing the work. In Penumbra, a 1981 installation (cat. no. 33), for example, the artist built 
an igloo-like structure from stacked newspaper "bricks." In a darkened basement, with only 
the igloo and a small cart spotlighted, the viewer was invited to lie face-up on the cart, and 
to pull himself or herself hand over hand by a rope along a track into the igloo. Within the 
solitude of the environment, the viewer saw patterns of diffused light and heard the muffled 
echoes of his or her own voice. Only by approaching the piece in this manner and by entering 
its essential core could the viewer partake of the complete experience. 

The ramifications of this piece are far-reaching within the artist's oeuvre. The architectural 
concept of building by stacking, and the use of ephemeral materials such as paper as 
construction elements, became leitmotifs for Kloth. The igloo in Penumbra conveyed a 
strong sculptural presence, and such central elements, constructed by the artist, were 
essential to subsequent installations as well. The light source, always visible, and the shad- 
ows cast by it also became integral to Kloth's work. 

In Encore, a 1 983 installation (cat. no. 34), the primary sculptural element was composed 
of a cylindrically rolled sheet of copper covered with asphalt; an intricate webbing of thin 
steel strips crowned the work. The process of stacking and arranging these strands to form 
a nestlike web recalls similar processes in nature — the weaving of a bird's nest, for example. 
While most of Kloth's imagery is abstract, it nonetheless retains a referential and symbolic 
element; thus in Encore the nest form was strongly suggestive of a haven or sanctuary. A 
powerful beam of light acted as a directional signal, drawing the viewer to the work's core. 
Attracted by the hallucinatory glow, the viewer walked through a wide chalk ring inscribing 
the sculpture, and as he or she stepped out again and traveled around the "nest," his or 
her track marks replicated the pattern of the steel tracery. Within the circle of illumination, 
the viewer was projected into the work and thus became part of it. The notion of focusing, 
expressed through either the use of light or the placement or juxtaposition of elements, is 
a strong undercurrent that runs throughout Kloth's oeuvre. 

If we were to remove one of the steel members of the central element in Encore, the 
piece would fall apart like a house of cards. This vulnerability is completely antithetical to 
our conception of the properties of steel. In a similar play on antithesis, Kloth confounds 
our expectations by often constructing the walls and ceilings of his installations of newspaper 
covered with black casein — thus employing a fragile material for a structural function. This 
tenuous line between strength and vulnerability, between permanence and impermanence, 
is a dominant concern of the artist. Indeed, his installations are always disassembled ulti- 
mately — the final proof of their ephemerality. 

Kloth considers his work to be a dialogue. There is, to be sure, an intimate interchange 
among parts in his installations. But this dialogue first takes place between the artist and 



23 



his world: Kloth scavenges his environment, collecting those articles that speak to him in 
both an aesthetic and an informative way, such as rusted drainpipes, the core of a baseball, 
a piece of a boiler, a roll of roofing material. The manner in which these manmade materials 
have been transformed through their use, and their revelation of a past appeal to the artist 
He lives with these objects in his work space, and in so doing receives from them suggestions 
for new incarnations. Through simple or complex manipulation and recombinations, these 
articles are transformed so that their abstract qualities rather than referential ones prevail. 

The realization of an installation is an intuitive process for Kloth. In Blindfolds and Pas- 
sages (cat. no. 35), the artist stacked cobblestone blocks in four graduated rows, feeling 
obliged to create a wall at the suggestion of the material. He then thought about movement 
through the wall and the metaphoric meanings of "breaking through," of overcoming life's 
hurdles. Long, thin metal strips resembling hay punctured this wall, and five charred paper 
cylinders straddled it. The resulting configuration was that of a cross, which enhanced the 
spiritual associations of the work. This reference to religion is not unique in Kloth's oeuvre: 
indeed, the central image of many of his pieces has an altarlike character. Color appeared 
for the first time in the artist's work in Blindfolds and Passages, on four panels of highly 
saturated red, green, violet and yellow placed on the four walls. The arms of the cross 
directed the viewer's attention to these "stations," simultaneously diffusing and emphasizing 
its centralized force. 

The introduction of color has had important repercussions in two more recent pieces, 
and indicates a possible direction for the future. In Bridging Paths and Passing Stage, (cat. 
nos. 39, 40), the artist has rubbed an intense chrome yellow into the canvas portions of the 
sculptures, so that the light sources are synonymous with the objects themselves. The 
circular rubbing of the pigment reinforces the theme of "focusing inward" or "honing in" that 
recurs throughout Kloth's oeuvre. The power of these works also rests in their nature as 
discrete objects, and as such they are strongly heraldic, even totemic. Yet the elements of 
chance and intuition are still inherent in the creative process: the metal drainpipes are found 
objects with preexisting forms and functions, but in each work Kloth himself makes the 
canvas into a cone by shaping it and stapling it to the wall. It therefore has no existence 
without the wall, and is as ephemeral as the installation itself. Though separate pieces, 
when installed together in a room Bridging Paths and Passing Stage have a unified impact 
on the viewer. Forced to the center of the room by intense color and the points of the cones, 
the viewer takes over the role of "essential core" formerly reserved for inanimate objects, 
a radical yet entirely logical shift in direction for the artist. 

Kloth's installations partake of an oriental tradition in the serenity and contemplativeness 
of his formal arrangements. The work also invites comparison with that of the Italian Arte 
Povera artists who sought to discover and extol the intrinsic magical worth of the elemental 
forces of nature — earth, air, fire, water, light and minerals. Kloth is also drawn to the 
sensitivity to and manipulation of materials in the work of Joseph Beuys and Anselm Kiefer. 

Kloth's environments are strongly evocative of landscape. We feel that he is seeking to 



24 



replicate a sense of place in his art, to make a record of an encounter between himself and 
his surroundings. To recall the experience of coming to a place, of concentrating on it and 
of the place holding onto us is part of the artist's intention in these installations. Kloth's work 
is at once physical and metaphysical. It retains both purity and clarity of purpose. 

The making of art is for Anthony-Peter Gorny a passionate concern, one that encom- 
passes all aspects of his life. As one critic has so aptly noted, it is a kind of secular religion 
for this artist." Gorny's art is a search for meaning; he believes in the artist's ability to extract 
meaning from what he or she sees and experiences. Yet at the same time he questions the 
possibility of attaining absolute meaning, knowing finally that paradox, inconsistency and 
change are basic conditions of human existence. 

The key (if indeed there is a key) to Gorny's art and thought is contained in his dianstic 
journals. These books are contemporary equivalents of illuminated manuscripts; they are 
magnificent objects, each unique, made by him of his own handmade papers and bound 
with colored endpapers embedded with a glorious array of leaves, flowers and pods. Though 
sometimes embellished with drawings or photographs, the books are mostly |ammed with 
the artist's thoughts, ideas and feelings, either jotted down in note form or elaborated upon 
as prose poems. On these pages, subjects as diverse as literature, art criticism, film, video 
and the artist's own work are explored with uncanny honesty; they are a wellspring for both 
the images and techniques that Gorny uses in his art. 

Gorny's oeuvre comprises drawings, handmade books, lithographs, photographs and 
sculpture; though each is treated as a separate and equally important discipline, the works 
overlap in iconography and style. The lithographs (cat. no. 1 3) display a meticulous balance 
of tone, nuance of texture and intricacy of line. Sometimes the artist prints on both sides of 
translucent Japanese paper, so that the layering of image and meaning takes on added 
complexity and ambiguity. The richness of detail in the lithographs is awe-inspiring. Man- 
nerist distortions in drawing, cryptic mirror writing reminiscent of Leonardo's, ambiguous 
spatial effects, unexpected viewpoints and juxtapositions, art-historical references and a 
wry humor contribute to the idiosyncratic quality of these pictorial diaries. 

References to ecclesiastical art and architecture abound in Gorny's oeuvre. The hand- 
made books, which have painted and carved wood or cast-bronze covers, recall medieval 
manuscripts. The bronze bookcover The Golden Book: The Root of All Evil (cat. no. 14) is 
reminiscent of fifteenth-century Florentine bronze baptistery doors in the way that the bas- 
relief figures emerge powerfully from the metal. A photographic installation entitled Alter a 
Plan of Duccio's Maesta (cat. no. 15) was conceived to replicate the format of the high altar 
of the Cathedral of Siena. Though translated into a modern-day context with themes of 
violence, nuclear destruction and white-collar crime, the spirit of the fifteenth-century mas- 
terpiece is magically preserved in Maesta. The simultaneous monumentality of the whole 
and intimacy of the individual panels of the Sienese source is retained in Gorny's work. So, 
too, is the hierarchical ordering of images (the central panel depicting the Madonna en- 
throned is replaced in Gorny's work with a brutal rape scene), narrative detail and elaborate 



25 



iconography. However, Gorny deliberately neutralizes the topical and violent character of 
his staged scenarios, in his words "cooling off" their reality to the point where they are 
"stillborn." 

The allegorical predella panels at the base of the Sienese altar appear again in a later 
work by Gorny, Transitivity Volumes 7-5 (cat. no. 10). Like the journals, these five large 
bookworks — handmade books encased in large sculptural frames — resemble illuminated 
manuscripts; each is a contemporary book of hours in its wealth of information and rich 
detail. The almost jewel-like front covers of layered rhoplex, pigment and carbon transfer 
are reminiscent of Romanesque art which, though often crudely embellished, achieves a 
high degree of elegance. The ornamented frames, which are cast in polyester resin from 
old frames and feature elaborate bas-reliefs of objects related to the volumes' themes, recall 
the foliated borders in illuminated manuscripts. Installed on a wall with their Predella Diptych 
panels of photographs beneath them (cat. no. 11), they truly become a contemporary 
altarpiece. 

Gorny spent a year studying in Siena, and it is therefore not surprising that Italian art and 
architecture from the late Romanesque period through the present have had a major impact 
on his work. Profoundly influential is fifteenth-century Sienese painting, which the artist 
knows not only from his travels, but also from visits to the extensive collection of the Phil- 
adelphia Museum of Art. The rich narrative quality of this north Italian art, the beautiful and 
somewhat primitive drawing, the realistic — yet not mimetic — qualities and the manner of 
capturing the essence of relationships and gestures are elements that Gorny seeks to 
translate into his lithographs and photographs. 

The photographs that comprise Maesta and the Predella Diptych panels are like small 
theatrical pieces in their composition and imagery. Just as a play can be performed again 
and again, some of these photographs are reused by Gorny in other contexts, such as It's 
Another Thing Altogether, a book that he published in1 978. These tableaux explore personal 
as well as universal images in contrived, Magritte-like situations which the artist stages in 
his studio. They are distillations of many of the thoughts recorded in his diaries, and are 
replete with verbal and visual puns. His props are objects drawn from the real world that 
evoke poetic responses in him. He writes in his journal of the possibility of a sacra con- 
versazione between these inanimate objects. 

There is an intense Surrealist quality to these photographs, and to some of the lithographs 
as well. The Surrealists' random and unexpected juxtapositions of objects are paralleled in 
the juxtapositions of images within Gorny's individual photographs, and in the combination 
of photographs into a larger oeuvre. Gorny insists, however, that despite the seeming ran- 
domness, the connections that exist in and among these works are strong and rational. 
Another goal of the Surrealists was to replenish poetic imagery through the illogical juxta- 
position and combination of words. The interplay of language and narrative in Gorny's work 
has a precedent in this Surrealist tradition. His oeuvre is filled with marvelous aphorisms 
of his own invention ("Nuclear Burns/Litter. Which is Worse, Paper or Plutonium?") that 



26 



cause us to rethink the meaning of words or of the visual images to which they are attached. 

The Surrealists believed the unconscious to be an essential source for art and life. Gorny 
differs slightly in this regard as his ideas, while often recorded in his writings in a stream- 
of-consciousness fashion, are not probed in dreams, but in a conscious and deliberate 
search within himself. His images are very much grounded in visual events and in the 
associations they trigger, and in art-historical sources ranging from Classical to Byzantine 
to Romantic. Gorny stresses that it is the spirit of past art, not the look of it, that he seeks 
to capture. 

The techniques Gorny employs reinforce the Surreal quality of his photographs. Picto- 
grams, double images, sharp contrasts of light and dark, inverted perspective, altered scale, 
stop-action photography, blurring, scratched negatives and extreme points of view are pro- 
vocative devices with which he challenges our perceptions. Additionally, the grainy textures, 
soft focus and selenium toning which endows the prints with a warm, purple cast impart a 
romantic, nineteenth-century aura to the photographs. 

Gorny's art, like Joseph Cornells, is acutely personal. The complex layering of imagery 
and meaning in the young artist's work also recalls the mystery and metaphor found in the 
American Surrealist's shadow boxes and collages. Like Cornell, Gorny has made his art 
his world, and his art becomes a poetic theater, reflecting that world. 

Though the nine artists in this exhibition do not represent an identifiable movement or school, 
one feature is salient when we consider them as a group That is their extraordinary achieve- 
ment in reconciling often opposing concerns in art: painting and sculpture, abstraction and 
representation, the secular and the spiritual, the private and the universal. These artists 
often turn to the art of the past for stylistic and technical inspiration. Yet in looking toward 
the future, they all achieve a clarity of expression that signals exciting new directions on 
the ever-changing horizon of American art.

PHOEBE ADAMS 



Statement by the artist 

An Example: I had a personal loss; one com- 
mon to most of us, but I didn't have a name for 
the feeling of that experience. I made an 
image of flying wings that don't work, pro- 
pelled by a symmetrical form that also no 
longer works; it sags. The sculpture con- 
notes its own history. 

There have always been crevices of west- 
ern art that are not concerned with any brand 
of heroicism. This is my lineage. I look at the 
outside world for particulars, for specifics 
that are clues. Similarly, I look at my internal 
landscape. Movement, form, growth, color, 
these parts of natural structures exist out- 
side our conceptions of the picturesque and 
political usefulness. That these sculptures 
are informed by the oddities of nature is nec- 
essarily true because that is what I see. The 
urgency to make an object is to give an ac- 
count of unnamed experiences, the unspeak- 
able feelings gleaned from peripheral vision.

MARK INNERST 



Statement by the artist 

Amidst irresistible technology, artistic hy- 
bridization, and mandatory appropriation, a 
well-considered painting on a single support 
seems as clear and unfettered an expression 
as a person could hope for.

T O B I K A H N 



Statement by the artist 

The surface always differs from what lies 
within, just as the entrance to a cave appears 
black, but, one step in, reveals a new world. 
My goal is to take that step into the cave, to 
find the hidden form. 

As a photographer I saw the scene as compo- 
sition, without detail, and as a painter I have 
tried to capture that ambiguity between fact, 
memory and imagination. The shapes I have 
chosen are deliberately simplified into 
archetypes of mountain, island, sea and sky. 
Later I may find a human form in the mountain 
and change the mountain to disclose both im- 
ages. So, the actual mountain (the fact) is re- 
membered as an archetype and then recast 
into another form as well. 

Sometimes I add shadows where, in reality, 
none could be cast, to emphasize that land- 
scape can also be read as a three-dimen- 
sional image against a background— much 
like the objects inside the shrines. The paint- 
ings are then both landscapes, referring to 
reality, and composites of free-floating 
forms, otherworldly and seductive in their al- 
lusiveness, their suggestion of something 
you think you know. They are meant to evoke 
a place you once visited but can no longer 
quite recall, remote as dreams.

Statement by the artist 



All of my current work comes from an obser- 
vation of nature, in its many moods and con- 
ditions. I hope to bring to this observation my 
personal vision, and to make the best paint- 
ing I can.

JOAN NELSON 



Statement by the artist 

There are human-constructed places which 
exist seemingly without habitation by living 
things. These insipid monuments to neglect 
are, from inception, built for utility and 
economy only; hence, any embellishment 
becomes superfluous. 

The attractive/repulsive quality of these 
areas beckons my memory to visit them 
again and again. Although I construct these 
images from personal recollection, I feel that 
they are universal, part of a collective 
memory.

JIM PETERS 



Statement by the artist 

For me painting is running through the 
streets of Manhattan trying to reach Mariel 
Hemingway before she leaves the country... 
or jumping fully clothed into the Seine as 
Jules and Jim talk philosophy.. . or dressing 
Viridiana in an old wedding dress searching 
for what you can not have.

IRENE PIJOAN 



Statement by the artist 

As a painter I observe, and connect the 
within to the without. 

Paintings are purposes gone askew; positing 
differs from intent. The making is a vehicle 
for an interminable dialogue between uttered 
and utterer. 

My job is to be fluid, with specificity. An at- 
tempt at finding balance in vertigo. 

Paintings: a bright one born at night, like 
plankton; one the sight of an escape, another 
of an excavation, another one, mulch. In this 
unbandaged march, memory and desire are 
of little bearing. Truth is of the moment only.
