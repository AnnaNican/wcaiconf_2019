A 



retrospective of Mark Rothko's painting would be an event of signifi- 
cance in any circumstances. The current presentation, however, is unique in 
two respects: first, it is the most comprehensive survey of Rothko's work ever 
held and, second, the artist's tragic death in 1970 bestows upon it a finality 
which obviously would not obtain in an exhibition mounted during his 
lifetime. Furthermore, this is the first show of Rothko's painting after an 
almost decade-long hiatus caused by extensive litigation — court proceed- 
ings that made it impossible until now to realize an exhibition or even to gain 
access to a representative sampling of the artist's lifework from which a 
selection could be made. 

Foremost among those who have extended their confidence to the 
Guggenheim Museum are the artist's daughter, Kate, and her husband, Ilya 
Prizel. Together with Edward J. Ross, of Breed, Abbott &amp; Morgan, legal 
representative for the Estate of Mark Rothko, and Sally and William Scharf, 
the Prizels continued to extend their help and support in every aspect of the 
project. In addition, Herbert Ferber, Executor, Estate of Mary Alice Rothko, 
and Stanley Geller, of Butler, Jablow and Geller, attorney for the Estate of 
Mary Alice Rothko, have helped us with the extensive work relating to the 
estate of the artist's wife. We also wish to acknowledge favorable action 
recommended by the newly-appointed Board of the Mark Rothko Foundation 
comprised of Donald Blinken, Chairman, Dorothy C. Miller, Gifford Phil- 
lips, David Prager, Emily Rauh Pulitzer, William Scharf and Jack Tworkov. 
Financing subsequently assumed great importance because of the exhi- 
bition's comprehensive scale and the high values of the works involved. The 
enormous interest shown by leading American museums from coast to coast 
resulted in a welcome pattern of collaboration. The Museum of Fine Arts, 
Houston, William C. Agee, Director; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 
Martin Friedman, Director; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
Kenneth Donahue, Director, agreed to cosponsor the presentation with the 
Guggenheim, thereby assuming for all participants a double advantage: 
broadened national impact for the show and increased financial resources, as 
each of the four museums assumed basic costs during the retrospective's 
year-long circulation. But even with this collaboration, expenses would have 
outrun available finances had the enterprise not benefited from corporate as 
well as governmental support — the two principal sources of funding that 
have become increasingly important for cultural institutions in recent years. 
We therefore underline the appreciation of all the participating museums for 



the equivalent sponsorship of the exhibition by the Atlantic Richfield 
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Both may take credit 
for helping to launch this significant event. 

The selection, organization and staging of the exhibition, as well as the 
authorship of the catalogue which accompanies it were the responsibility of 
Diane Waldman, the Guggenheim's Curator of Exhibitions. Mrs. Waldman 
approached her task with exemplary thoroughness, seeking out primary 
sources of information and thus adding substantially to the existing fund of 
knowledge about the artist, his life and his work. In the process of her 
researches, she obtained much new and valuable information, often in the 
form of previously unpublished documentary material, from the following 
friends and colleagues of Mark Rothko: Mrs. Milton Avery, Jimmy Ernst, 
Mrs. Adolph Gottlieb, H. R. Hays, Buffie Johnson, Katharine Kuh, 
Mildred and Joseph Liss, Dorothy C. Miller, Dr. Max Naimark, Mrs. 
Barnett Newman; Wallace Putnam, Jon Schueler; Lee Sievan, Joseph Sol- 
man, Oliver Steindecker, Pat Ttivigno, Jack Tworkov and Edward Wein- 
stein. The following have helped us obtain photographs and gather informa- 
tion about Rothko's work: Ronnie Baer, The Museum of Modern Art, New 
York; Sidney Janis Gallery; Mayor Gallery; David McKee Gallery; Pace 
Gallery; Betty Parsons Gallery. The catalogue obviously has been greatly 
enriched by Mrs. Waldman's extensive essay and by the personal recollec- 
tions of Bernard Malamud which shed new light upon the subject of this 
study. 

An undertaking as far-reaching as the current exhibition and catalogue 
involves all levels of the Museum's organization. Therefore, the 
Guggenheim's staff as a whole should be thanked for their diligence and 
devotion. The following staff members were most directly concerned with 
the preparation of the exhibition and the catalogue: Clair Zamoiski, Cura- 
torial Coordinator, who contributed to all aspects of the exhibition and 
publication; Carol Fuerstein, Editor, who edited the catalogue and saw it 
through the presses; Susan Hirschfeld, Curatorial Assistant, who helped with 
the publication's preparation and production; Maud Lavin, Curatorial In- 
tern, who did research; Linda Shearer, Assistant Curator, who aided in the 
exhibition's preliminary stages. 

Our last and in some ways most important acknowledgement is ad- 
dressed to the lenders who, in a most tangible sense, have made this 
retrospective possible. Unless they wished to remain anonymous, their 
names are cited elsewhere in this catalogue, but our indebtedness to them 
and our gratitude for the confidence that their loans imply go far beyond such 
a perfunctory gesture. 

Mark Rothko, 1903—1970: A Retrospective represents a mighty commit- 
ment by the participating museums — one that was realized only with the 
fullest aid and support of every kind. In Diane Waldman's name and on 
behalf of my colleagues, I therefore extend to all those who have helped so 
generously, our deeply felt gratitude.

Preface 



12 J_VXark Rothko shares with composers of music an absence of explicit 

imagery and a correspondingly developed capacity to evoke content by 
association; an ability to engage the responding organ (in his case, the eye) in 
a process that is akin to listening because it involves attention to consecutive 
passages; an interest in rhythmic structures (in his case, spatially articu- 
lated); and the use of color to achieve modulations that can be subtly 
chromatic or dramatically contrasted. Beyond this, Rothko's sensibility 
would seem to evoke the era of German Romanricism arid with it the great 
names from Schubert through Brahms. Like them, Rothko is a creator of 
melodic surfaces rendered vital and sonorous by means of formal structures 
which are, for rhe most part, hidden. Also, like many of them, Rothko often 
creates for himself restricted formats which he then explores in a seemingly 
endless succession of rich variants. Finally, Rothko's orchestral propensities 
are, like those of the great Romantics, simultaneously ponderous and heroic, 
often lyrical in mood but never sentimental. 

But music comes to mind here not only because Rothko uses devices 
analogous to those of the composers nor because he shares with them a 
broadly romantic sensibility. We think of music because Rothko's painting, 
so firmly structured, so rhythmically articulated and so subtly colored, has 
achieved a directness and force of expression rightly attributed to the tonal 
language more than to any other. 

This comprehensive retrospective of Mark Rothko's lifework at the 
Guggenheim Museum and three American sister institutions should, there- 
fore, envelop the visitor in an experience simultaneously intellectual and 
sensuous — an experience which reaches through eyes, deepened in rheir 
capacity, to the mind, the heart and the total being.

The Aquamarine Sunrise: a memory of Roth ko 



M. 



-ark had been to John Kennedy's inaugural blast in 1961 and here he 
was, four years later, at Lyndon Johnson's, where my wife Ann and I met him 
and Mell. That night we were riding with two busloads of artists and 
performers from one pleasant entertainment to another. The company was 
exciting, the mood hilarious — Happy New Year still going on. Either on our 
bus, or at one party or another, I remember seeing or talking with people like 
Samuel Barber, Jasper Johns, Richard Wilbur, Anna Moffo, William Goyen 
and Edward Steichen. The buses were marked "Cultural Leaders" and led by 
sirening police cars at a fast clip through the streets of Washington. Mell 
Rothko, twenty years younger than her husband, was chatting from the seat 
behind us with Ann. Then Mark leaned forward and introduced himself. For 
a moment because of my associations with the Northwest I thought he had 
said Mark Tobey but he set me straight. We enjoyed being cultural leaders. 
Mark was beamish. Mell, in a happy mood, told my wife she had got him to 
propose by sitting in his lap and asking him to. 

At dinner in the New State Department building, Mark and Mell, Ann 
and I, and, I think, Bill and Doris Goyen, sat together at a table with Henry 
Cabot Lodge, who was then Ambassador to South Vietnam, and his wife 
Emily. The Ambassador piled his plate and ate away: he said he hadn't eaten 
lunch. Mark, after cocktails, was high. He turned to Lodge and owlishly 
asked, "And what do you do?" Lodge told him. Mark, taking another look at 
him, got up on his feet and apologized. Lodge nodded courteously. They 
shook hands. Mark later told Ann the incident had embarrassed him. 

After that we occasionally met Mark in New York City, usually at the 
home of Use and Karl Schrag, the painter and printmaker. They were 
neighbors who lived diagonally across the way from the Rothkos on East 
95th. One day I was in town and coming to dinner at the Schrags. Use had 
gone across the street and lent Mark one of my books. He said he didn't read 
much but would have a go at it. She invited him to join us at dinner. He told 
her he liked being invited out at short notice, but he didn't think his wife 
would want to come. When he came over he told me he was familiar with the 
kind of people I'd written about in my book. He spoke of his Jewish 
immigrant family in Portland, Oregon, when he was a boy. I was very much 
interested in the Oregon connection because I had lived for a dozen years in 
Corvallis, a town south of Portland. Mark liked to reminisce: One night he 
told us how he had left his first wife. He had gone off for an army physical 
during World War II and they had turned him down. When he arrived home

and told his wife he was 4-F he didn't like the look that flitted across het face. 
The next day he went to see his lawyet about a divorce. 

Once, early in the winter of 1969, when we were subletting an apart- 
ment on Gramercy Park South, I stopped by to see Mark in his studio on East 
69th Street. He wasn't working and seemed glad I had come. We spent most 
of the afternoon in the huge studio listening to Mozart and talking casually. 
On the coffee table was an open book on Shakespeare. He told me he had left 
Mell and talked about his depression. Mark recited his various troubles yet 
seemed content with himself. He had had a good summer, not at the 
beginning but good after a while. He had beaten out a severe depression and 
after a difficult time was able to work well in Provincetown. At first he'd 



been given an antidepressant that tasted "brassy" and hadn't entirely relieved 
him so he went to another doctor, who had added or subtracted a pill, and 
thereafter he felt relief and could work. He'd had a prolific several months 
painting a flood of acrylics on paper. He said they had come to hundreds of 
paintings that summer and afterwards. He was in a period of wonderful 
productivity. It was a fine afternoon. 

When I asked if I could see some of the summer's work he said he had 
already sold the best paintings. He dropped about ten or a dozen on the floor 
and said I could select from all but one, if I wanted. That was a black 
rectangle, about two feet by three, the black broken by a three or four inch 
jagged section in bright aquamarine. The aquamarine looked like light 
breaking through night. It was an uneven form, perhaps zigzag, unlike 
anything I'd seen in his work. I wondered if he was unwilling to part with it 
because it was a unique form for him; and I felt the picture held some special 
significance, which I interpreted to be symbolic of the dissolution of his 
black mood. I asked about that painting but he said he wouldn't part with it. 15 

I wasn't much taken by the one-tone flat maroons and almost solid 
blacks on the floor but offered to show two of them to my wife. Mark said I 
could have the two for six-thousand dollars. He rolled the paintings into a 
cardboard cylinder which I brought home to Bennington. Ann and I 
examined them and decided they didn't represent Rothko to us. She returned 
them in the cylinder, insured, as Mark had requested, for twelve thousand 
dollars apiece. I sent a note saying that when he did some more acrylics on 
paper we hoped he would let us see them. There was no reply. 

When we talked on the phone in December, when I was again spending 
the winter at Gramercy Park, I invited him to a party at our apartment and he 
said he would come and could he bring a friend. The night of the party he 
called to say he couldn't make it and would like to have a rain check. I said 
that for me where there was rain there were rain checks. 

Shortly before he died in February, 1970, the Schrags saw Mark from 
their window, across the street. His long hair was lank. He looked haggard, 
pale, joyless. 

That cold winter's night, one day after Mark Rothko had committed 
suicide, there was a small talky subdued crowd at the funeral home on 
Madison Avenue. Mark lay in his coffin with a pair of horn-rimmed glasses 
on his nose. He had been shaved and barbered and dressed in a dark suit. 
Standing there, I made my peace with him. 

Karl Schrag thought he would not have taken his life if he hadn't been 
seriously ill. 

Stanley Kunitz said that his death meant the end of an era in painting. 

Mell, as I left, was glad I could come. 

I said I didn't think I would be going to the funeral tomorrow. 

She asked if I remembered the night in the bus when we were cultural 
leaders and everything was fine.

1 The American Sublime 

How does one stand 
To behold the sublime, 
To confront the mockers, 
The mickey mockers 
And plated pairs? 

When General Jackson 
Posed for his statue 
He knew how one feels. 
Shall a man go barefoot 
Blinking and blank? 

But how does one feel? 
One grows used to the weather, 
The landscape and that; 
And the sublime comes down 
To the spirit itself, 

The spirit and space, 

The empty spirit 

In vacant space. 

What wine does one drink? 

What bread does one eat? 

Wallace Stevens, 1935 



MARK ROTHKO 

The Farther Shore of Art 




u 



At the "Icehouse,'' Yorktown Heights, New York, ca. 1949 

The death of Mark Rothko on February 25, 1970, at the age of 67, brought 
to a close an era in which the myth of the artist as hero seemed as important as 
the period's now legendary paintings. Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, 
David Smith, Franz Kline and others of the New York School had also met 
untimely ends, but it is Rothko's suicide that is the most disturbing, 
symbolically, of all these deaths. For it came in an age that values neither the 
hero nor the antihero and it demonstrated clearly, not a disbelief in art, but 
in the central role of the self in painting — a concept vital to Rothko and his 
contemporaries but antithetical to the ideas of a subsequent generation 
which views detachment on the part of the artist as essential. 

Rothko's ambition was to rank with the greatest figures of Western 
art. This painter of genius wanted to achieve the grandeur of tradition and 
at the same time to rebel against tradition. The struggle to attain this 
paradoxical goal ultimately destroyed his confidence. The tragedy of Roth- 
ko's death, then, lies not only in its termination of a brilliant career, but in 
that it marked the end of an attitude towards the role of the artist and art 
itself.

'n August 5, 1913, the ten year old Marcus Rothkowitz sailed to 
America aboard the S.S. Czar from the Russian port of Libau with his 
mother, Anna, and his older sister, Sonia. His father, Jacob, a fairly 
well-to-do pharmacist in Russia, had emigrated to the United States in 
1910. He traveled to Portland, Oregon, where his brother, Samuel Wein- 
stein, had established himself some years earlier and founded a flourishing 
men's clothing business, the New York Outfitting Company. 1 Shortly after 
the senior Rothkowitz found employment as a pharmacist, he sent for his two 
eldest sons, Moise and Albert, and two years later for his wife, daughter and 
Marcus, the youngest child. 

The latter three, listed in the Manifest of Alien Passengers (fig. 1) as 
"Markus," "Scheine" and "Chaje Rotkowicz," arrived in New York on 
August 17 . As second-cabin passengers they did not have to enter the United 
States through Ellis Island. Instead, they disembarked in New York and 
then proceeded to New Haven, where they stayed with Weinstein cousins for 
ten days. Then they traveled by train to Portland, wearing badges indicating 
they did not speak English. In Portland, they settled in the Jewish section of 
the southwest part of town. Seven months after they arrived, Jacob died. 

Life in Czarist Russia was very difficult for most Jews. Subject to 
extreme repression, they were unable to move about freely and were re- 
stricted to living in certain quarters. Advanced education was a privilege 
denied to all but a tiny minority. There was a quota system, with few Jews 
allowed into high school and even fewer into college. Nonetheless, Jacob 
Rothkowitz was able to provide a comfortable existence for his family and 
schooling for his children. Born on September 25, 1903, in Dvinsk, Marcus 
was considerably younger than his sister, who was fourteen at the time of his 
birth, and his brothers Moise and Albert, who were eleven and eight 
respectively. Like many Jewish boys in Eastern Europe in this era, Marcus 
was sent to Hebrew school and studied the scriptures and the Talmud. 
Despite these educational advantages, the family faced an uncertain future in 
Russia, and Jacob decided that they would fare better in America. 

When Jacob died, the children were forced to go to work. Sonia, who had 
been trained as a dentist in Russia, became a bookkeeper and clerk at the New 
York Outfitting Company, while Moise and Albert also worked for the 
Weinstein family until they learned English well enough to pass the qualifying 
exams required to become pharmacists. Marcus worked as a delivery boy and 
took on a newspaper route.

Three graduates of the Lincoln high school In the June '21 class left 
Portland last week to enter Yale. They are Marcus Rothkowitz, Max 
.Valmark and Harry Director, three Russian boys, none of whom has been In 
,thls country longer than seven years. 

All three made brilliant records In scholarship during the time they were 
In Lincoln high and passed their college entrance examinations soon after 
graduation. They will stay at Yale four years. They Intend to become 
professional men, but have not yet decided upon their life work. 
1 Max Naimark has been In the United States only four years. He spent 
Ine year In the elementary schools and three years In high school. All threoj 
■ nk pip college preparatory course In high school. 



Marcus attended Shattuck Grade School and Lincoln High School, 
completing high school with an extraordinary record in only three years (figs. 
2,3)- While attending Lincoln, he worked in the shipping department of the 
family store. At this time, Marcus took drawing and painting classes at a 
local art school with two of his cousins and often sketched on the store 
wrapping paper. 2 His feeling for music emerged now, encouraged by his 
uncle, Samuel Weinstein, whose two daughters studied at Juilliard. Al- 
though Marcus had no formal music training, he taught himself to play the 
mandolin and later the piano. In high school, he was especially interested in 
social studies and literature and, despite his recent emigration, was fluent 
enough in English to be a proficient debater. Concerned with the labor 
movement and radical causes, he hoped to be a labor organizer, an ambition 
consistent with the liberal politics of many Russian Jews, born of the harsh 
realities of their situation. Many years later, the artist related: 

While 1 was still in grade school . . . I listened to Emma Goldman and to j \ 

the IWW orators who were plentiful on the West Coast in those days. I was 

enchanted by their naive and child-like vision. Later, sometime in the 

Twenties I guess 1 lost all faith in the idea of progress and reform . So did all 

my friends. Perhaps we were disillusioned because everything seemed so 

frozen and helpless during the Coolidge and Hoover era. But I am still an 

anarchist. What else? 2 

In September 192 1, Rothkowitz left Portland for New Haven to attend 
Yale University — a Weinstein family tradition — with two former high 
school classmates and fellow Russian emigrants, Aaron Harry Director and 
Max Naimark(fig. 4). The dean of Yale, sent to Portland to recruit students, 
and Lincoln High School's chemistry teacher, a Yale graduate, had encour- 
aged them to apply to the University. The three traveled across country by 
train. Marcus and Max shared a Pullman berth. 

Naimark recounts their stay at the University as follows: 

During our freshman year at Yale, Marcus and I roomed together in a 
third floor room . . . at 840 Howard Avenue , NewHaven. . . . Marc and I 
didn't see much of each other except late in the evenings when we returned to 
our room. . . .Marcus didn't seem to need much studying and spent a 
considerable amount of time with his relatives in New Haven . . . the 
Weinsteins . . . who also lived on Howard Avenue . . . . The Weinsteins had 
two sons, architects, graduates of Yale and living in Neiv Haven at the 
time. As far as I was concerned. Marc was brilliant. He did not have to 
study much, didn't pay much attention to some of the subjects or the 
professors he didn't particularly like. 

For the second year at Yale . . . Marc moved to the Yale dorms and roomed 
with Harry Director and another student. 

At no time have I seen Marc paint. He did much informal drawing and 
sketching which to me looked quite good but that's about all. 4 

Although Marcus and his two friends had received full scholarships to the 
University, these were cancelled after one year. Nevertheless, all three stayed 
on. Marcus remained until 1923, studying English, French, history, 
mathematics, physics, biology, economics and philosophy. During his sec- 
ond year he took all his meals with the Weinsteins to save money and worked 



at odd jobs in the Yale student Iaundty and at two different cleanets neat the 
campus. He excelled in math and setiously consideted becoming an en- 
gineer. In his sophomote yeat, Rothkowitz, Ditectot and Simon Whitney, 
another student, published a short-lived weekly, the progressive The Yale 
Saturday Evening Pest. More a pamphlet than a newspaper, it contained 
articles, comments, editotials and criticism on subjects of interest to Yale 
students. The sheet's decidedly liberal point of view as well as its propagan- 
dist nature were quite unusual for Yale in the twenties. 

Marcus left Yale — probably because he became bored with his studies, 
possibly also due to financial difficulties — in 1923, without receiving his 
degree, to "wander around, bum about, starve a bit." 5 Without any cleat 
idea of what he wanted to do, he moved to New York and rented a room at 19 
West 102nd Street. He seems to have become an artist by chance. "I 
happened to wander into an art class, to meet a friend who was taking the 
course," he explained. "All the students were sketching the nude model — 
22 and right away I decided that was the life fot me." 6 He began taking anatomy 

courses at the Art Students League with George Bndgman. At this time, he 
suppotted himself by taking odd jobs, including work in the garment 
district. Rothkowitz worked for a while as a bookkeeper for a Weinstein 
relative, Samuel Nichtberger, a CPA and tax attorney with offices on 
Broadway. Naimark tells us: 

Not too long after he left Yale I saw him in the Bronx [sic] where he lived 
in a one room apartment and I got the impression that he was earning a few 
dollars drawing patterns for some materials. I lost track of him after that, 
though I did hear that he hitchhiked to the West Coast once or twice but 
didn't know anything definite for some years. Then I began to hear and 
read about his accomplishments as a painter and artist. 7 

He returned for a short period in 1924 to Portland and joined an acting 
company run by Clark Gable's first wife, Josephine Dillon. Gable was also in 
the company then and it is likely that they became acquainted befote Gable 
left for Hollywood with Miss Dillon. In fact, the artist was to claim that 
Gable had been his understudy. Despite the brief duration of this experience, 
his fascination for theater continued. To some extent it influenced his choice 
of dramatic themes in his painting of the early 1940's. And as late as 1947-48 
he said: 

/ think of my pictures as dramas; the shapes in the pictures are the 
performers. They have been created from the need for a group of actors who 
are able to move dramatically without embarrassment and execute gestures 
without shame. 9 

Although Rothkowitz continued to make frequent visits to Portland 
during the 1920's, he returned to New York for good in 1925. He had reached 
a decision about his future dictated not by his love of math, music, literature, 
philosophy, engineering, radical causes or the theater, but by a compelling 
interest in art. Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Nietzsche and 
Kierkegaard continued to sustain and nutture him throughout his life. He was 
fascinated by literature and had apparently once considered becoming a 
professional writer. But his commitment to painting prevailed, and from now 
on he devoted himself to it. Years afterward, he was to remark: "I became a 
painter because I wanted to raise painting to the level of poignancy of music 
and poetry." 9 



At the beginning of his career, he was still known as Marcus 
Rothkowitz. In 1940, however, he began to use the name Mark Rothko, first 
sporadically and with minor variations, such as Marcus Rothko, then consis- 
tently and without modifications. Although he became a United States 
citizen in 1938, he did not legally change his name until 1959- Exactly why 
he chose to shorten his name is unknown. Friends have variously explained 
that he was asked to change his name by a dealer, that it signalled a dramatic 
change in his style, or that the artist himself decided it was too cumbersome, 
too foreign and that a simpler one would be better for his career, citing the 
painter Arshile Gorky as a precedent. 

His works of the late twenties, conventional but sensitive urban scenes, 
spontaneous landscapes and studies of nudes (cat. nos. 2, 6), are the products 
of a young and talented student. They reflect a realist trend dominant in 
American art in the 1920's that had little to do with the ongoing revolution 
in painting and sculpture taking place in Europe. Cubism, Futurism, 
Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism and Surrealism were alien to the 23 

experience of most artists in the United States at this time. As Rothko later 
said of realism, "that was what we inherited." 10 

Artists like Thomas Hart Benton set the standard for American paint- 
ing during the 1920's and 1930's. Benton, like many others who had 
embraced avant-garde art, turned violently against abstraction after World 
War I. His reaction was symptomatic of the country's political, social and 
aesthetic conservatism, its isolationism and chauvinism, its mood of pro- 
found despair, born of the war and deepened by the Depression. Provin- 
cialism in the form of the Regionalism favored by Benton, Grant Wood and 
John Steuart Curry and the American Scene Painting of Reginald Marsh, 
Isabel Bishop, the Soyer brothers, the Social Realism of Ben Shahn and 
Philip Evergood and others, prevailed in the American artistic climate until 
World War II. Even artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley and 
Stanton MacDonald- Wright, who had been in the crowded vanguard of 
experimental abstraction, returned at least for a time to representation. 
Although a small number of Americans, Arthur Dove, Morgan Russell and 
Stuart Davis among them, and Europeans, like Josef Albers and Hans Hof- 
mann, who came to the United States in the early 1930's, continued to work 
in advanced styles, the majority of painters concerned themselves with 
depicting the poverty and disillusionment of the downtrodden urban masses or 
celebrated rural life. Everyday reality was the subject of artistic comment, as 
painting often became topical, journalistic, illustrational. 

The Regionalism or "realism" that Rothko and his generation inherited 
was to a certain extent offset by the teaching of Max Weber, in whose class 
Rothko worked when he re-enrolled in the Art Students League upon his 
permanent return to New York. Although Rothko studied with Weber for 
only a short time, from October through December of 1925 and again from 
March through May of 1926, his influence on the young painter was 
considerable. It is obvious that Weber's sophisticated knowledge of paint- 
ing, his ardent admiration for Cezanne and his introduction of the more 
modern painters made a strong impression on his students. At an early stage 
of his career, Weber had rapidly absorbed the lessons of both Fauvism and 
Cubism. He had produced several superb Cubist paintings, foremost among 
them Chinese Restaurant of 1915 (fig. 5). Like the Cubists, Weber employed 
trompe l'oeil as an integral part of his work. The Cubists used these elements 
as decorative, additive accents, incorporating fragments of real or simulated 



24 




materials into their collages in order to question the nature of illusion and 
reality. Weber, however, insisted upon painting literal facsimile versions of 
textures and patterns with an attention to detail that often took precedence 
over formal order. This characteristic directly relates Weber to such 
nineteenth-century American masters of trompe l'oeil as William M. Har- 
nett and John F. Peto. Later he adopted a form of Expressionism, derived 
from Soutine and Chagall, that he conveyed with enthusiasm to his students. 
Rothko's indebtedness to Weber's late style is readily apparent in both the 
choice of subjects and mood of his paintings of the 1920's. Less obvious but 
more meaningful is the imprint Weber's Cubist work was to leave on his later 
painting. Gethsemane and Primeval Landscape, both 1945 (cat. nos. 65, 66), 
for example, contain emblematic forms juxtaposed upon a flat backdrop in a 
manner that recalls Weber's combination of trompe l'oeil technique and 
collage-like images. Weber's spatial illusionism and play is, however, di- 
minished in Rothko's canvases. Rothko's paintings are more frontal and 
two-dimensional, perhaps because they are in part inspired by Hartley's very 
flat, heraldic paintings of military symbols of 19 14 (fig. 6). But the play has 
not altogether disappeared: remnants of the curiously shifting planes of 
Chinese Restaurant find their way into Rothko's spatially ambiguous works of 
the mid-1940's onward. 

During the late 1920's, Rothko supported himself by drawing maps for a 
book on popularized biblical history written by Lewis Browne, a retired rabbi 
from Portland who was a relative of Rothko's schoolmate, Harry Director. He 
moved to 231 East 25th Street and took a job in 1929 teaching children 
part-time at the Center Academy, Brooklyn Jewish Center, a position he 
retained until 1952. Teaching, in fact, was to be his primary means of 
supporting himself until he became financially successful as an artist. 

At the age of twenty-five, in 1928, Rothko was included in his first 
group exhibition at the Opportunity Galleries in New York. Bernard Karfiol 
chose several of his paintings for the show, together with works by Milton 
Avery, Louis Harris and others. His first one-man show in New York did not 
take place until 1933 at the Contemporary Arts Gallery. The review of the 
exhibition reads as follows:

Our Odyssey ends with the Contemporary Art Gallery. Always engaged in 
fresh and unusual projects . such as the "Painting of the Month" club 
which is achieving great success , this gallery's repeated presentations of new 
artists are very exhilarating. The newcomer is Maurice Rothkowitz. No 
aid from the catalog is necessary to inform us of his art education. The 
ponderous structure of the "Nude" harks back to the "Eight Figures" of 
Max Weber. In other works, here is the full-fledged influence of Cezanne. 
Pigment modeling apparent in "Man Smoking" is not confined to oil. since 
"Portland" in watercolor shows the same tendencies. Of the black and 
white, "Riverside Drive" appears to be the most outstanding sketch} ' 



In all probability, the canvas referred to is the bulky nude of 1930 (cat. no. 
10). While there is some evidence of Weber's influence on Rothko in the 
scumbled, heavily ladened brushwork of this painting, the apparent sources 
for the figure of the nude are Picasso's Two Nudes, late 1906, and Matisses 
such as The Blue Nude (Souvenir of Biskra), 1907, and Bathers with a Turtle, 
1908 (figs. 7-9). 

Many of Rothko's watercolors of the period refer specifically to Marin 



25 




and through him to Cezanne. The triangular organization of a number of 
Rothko's paintings of this time recalls not only Cezanne but the art of the 
Renaissance, which the young artist very much admired. To be sure, the 
rational, harmonious order imposed by the classical device of the triangle is 
entirely at odds with Rothko's turbulent technique and expressionist color. 
Stylistic consistency was something he had yet to achieve. 

As Rothko's experience broadened, he seized upon subjects other than 
the typical classroom still lifes, landscapes and nudes. He began to depict 
street and waterfront views, bathers, horses, portraits, the theater, religious 
themes and domestic subjects such as music lessons and women sewing (cat. 
nos. 9,11, 12), in what seems to have been an attempt to make a diary of the 
world about him. He variously tried his hand at oils, watercolors and pen and 
ink or pencil drawings. His drawings and watercolors are extremely assured 
if not highly original. The oils are the most promising albeit least resolved 
work of these years. They are somber, ruggedly expressionist, heavily 
26 painted works in which figures with twisted heads alternate with contorted 

nudes and dark landscapes. Their brooding introspection and romantic 
feeling already reflect the sensibility that was to inform his dark paintings of 
the late 1950's and 1960's. 

It is difficult to trace the evolution of Rothko's style and themes with 
exactitude because, for many reasons, the dating of the period of the twenties 
through the mid-forties is problematic. For one, Rothko rarely dated his 
paintings at this time — only many years later, when he made an inventory of 
his work, did he do so, without records and relying entirely upon his 
memory. Thus, his Avery-like figures on a beach, which are presently dated 
about 1925-27, could conceivably have been painted after 1928, the year 
Rothko and Avery first exhibited together. And the subway paintings, some 
of which are currently assigned to 1930, might more sensibly, on the basis of 
stylistic evidence, be reattributed to the mid or late 1930's. The work cannot 
precisely be dated on the basis of its appearance in particular exhibitions, as 
Rothko seems to have included paintings executed over a number of years in 
each show, well into the 1940's. (The idea of conceiving paintings especially 
for an exhibition or of showing only recent work did not gain currency until 
much later.) Moreover, many canvases have more than one title, more than one 
date and were oriented in more than one direction. Further confusion in dating 
arises because Rothko's thinking was often in advance of his painting. As early 
as 1936, for example, while working on the subway paintings, he began to 
write in his notebooks on the meaning of myth: he did not, however, start to 
paint mythic subjects until 1938, when he started Antigone (cat. no. 23), nor 
did he publish his fully articulated position on such themes until 1943. In the 
same year Rothko painted Antigone, he continued to work in a realist vein and 
produced the definitive subway canvas, Subway Scene (cat. no. 22). In fact, he 
often continued to work in one style while experimenting with another, more 
advanced formulation. The way Rothko's work was characterized by critics 
also contributes to misconceptions about his style: during the 1930s, for 
example, he was known as an Expressionist, when his subway paintings, 
expressive as they are, have little in them that is Expressionist. 

Despite the strong effect Weber had on his work, Rothko was to 
maintain that he was largely self-taught and had "... learned painting from 
his contemporaries in their studios." 12 There was some truth in this asser- 
tion, for in the late 1920's, as a young artist just beginning to come into his 
own, he discovered that there were numerous alternatives to Weber's style. 



The single most viable alternative was presented by Avery. In all probability, 
Avery and Rothko met in 1928, when both showed at the Opportunity 
Galleries. Later, it seems that the violinist Louis Kaufman, who, like 
Rothko, came from Portland, brought the young artist to Avery's home. 
Their friendship was immediate. 

Rothko and a number of his colleagues looked to Avery for inspiration, 
even though he was only about ten years older than they. (Paradoxically, 
Avery did not arrive at his most successful statements until after Rothko 
developed his own mature style. Indeed, Rothko was an influence upon Avery 
by the early 1950's.) Avery's studio was open to many younger artists. His 
accessibility, his gentle manner, his willingness to engage in dialogue, were a 
refreshing change from the student-teacher relationships that artists of Roth- 
ko's generation had previously experienced. As Avery's wife, Sally, has re- 
marked: 

[Rotbko] dropped in almost every day to see what Milton was painting. 27 

We spent summers together on Cape Ann where everyday we met at the beach 
for swimming and every evening we looked over the day's work. Adolph 
Gottlieb was there too and Barnett Newman joined us. Milton did a 
number of water colors using these friends as models. 

Among the portraits Avery painted of his young friends is a 1933 oil of 
Rothko (fig. 10). Rothko indicated Avery's importance in the moving 
eulogy he delivered upon his death in 1965: 

This conviction of greatness, the feeling that one was in the presence of great 
events, was immediate on encountering his work. It was true for many of us 
who were younger, questioning and looking for an anchor . . . . 

I cannot tell you what it meant for us during those early years to be made 
welcome in those memorable studios on Broadway, 12nd Street, and 
Columbus Avenue. We were, there, both the subjects of his paintings and 
his idolatrous audience. The walls were always covered with an endless 
and changing array of poetry and light. 

There have been several others in our generation who have celebrated the 
world around them, but none with that inevitability where the poetry 
penetrated every pore of the canvas to the very last touch of the brush. For 
Avery was a great poet-inventor who had invented sonorities never seen nor 
heard before. From these we have learned much and will learn more for a 
long time to come. 

But from these there have been fashioned great canvases, that far from the 
casual and transitory implications of the subjects, have always a gripping 
lyricism, and often achieve the permanence and 'monumentally of Egypt. 14 

Avery's pastoral subject matter was, to be sure, alien to Rothko's urban 
sensibility. Rothko did, however, paint some figures in interiors, domestic 
and seaside scenes in a manner reminiscent of Avery (cat. nos. 4, 7). It 
was not Avery's themes — which were typical thirties genre subjects — but 
his refreshing style that opened doors for Rothko. His precisely delineated, 
Matisse-derived flattened form and soft, lyrical color became integral parts of

Rothko's work and acted as antidotes to Weber's heavily painted, greyed 
hues and expressionistic manner. Avery's ability to minimize the numbers of 
shapes and colors he used and maximize their importance was of significance 
to younger artists like Rothko, as was the simplicity and directness of his 
figures. Avery was, in effect, the bridge between Matisse and Rothko. 
Rothko's Subway Scene, 1938 (cat. no. 22), reveals a number of parallels with 
Avery's work. Its scrubbed surface may be compared to Avery's painterly 
technique, and its figures are clearly derived from Avery's own forms. While 
there is an affinity between the stratified composition of Subway Scene and a 
canvas such as Avery's Coney Island, 1936 (fig. 1 1), Rothko's structure is 
much more overtly architectonic and geometric. Only rarely and in paintings 
closely modeled upon the older artist's did Rothko employ the diagonal 
compositions Avery favored as a means of reconciling the illusion of depth 
with the two-dimensional picture plane (fig. 12). It is notable that Rothko's 
mature preference for an inherently flat, frontal structure is already strik- 
ingly apparent in this painting. 

Equally noteworthy here is Rothko's use for the first time of a single 
specific theme in a group of works, for Subway Scene is one of a number of 
subway canvases (cat. nos. 16, 18, 20) he executed in the 1930's. While 
these subway paintings are perhaps not sufficiently unified to constitute a 
true series, they do attest to an effort on Rothko's part to clarify his ideas in a 
number of related works and thus prefigure his mature series, the Seagram, 
Harvard and Houston chapel murals. 

Rothko was attracted to the subject of the subway during the period of 
the WPA: its distinctly urban flavor and the opportunity it afforded to depict 
the dispirited masses dear to the artists of the Depression had obvious 
appeal at the time. It was a common enough theme during the thirties. A 
number of artists, Marsh, Bishop, Joseph Solman, Francis Criss among 
them, painted subway scenes in this era. Rothko, however, was the only one 
to endow the image with dignity, remoteness and a sense of dream-like 
suspension of motion, qualities more appropriate, perhaps, to the timeless 
formal order of Renaissance paintings than the contemporary, timely charac- 
ter of the subject. 

The subway paintings are chalky, executed in ". . . wan, whitened color 
like frescoes from Herculaneum. . . ," 15 Human form is attenuated until it 
almost ceases to exist; the bulky figures of the 1920's are pared down, as 
density is replaced by transparency. Formerly monolithic presences become 
shadowy, apparitional. Ghostly and unreal, these personages appear and 
disappear among the subway pillars. Even where several people are grouped 
together, there is a sense of silence, of distance and lack of communication 
that is extremely disorientating and recalls Edward Hopper or Giorgio de 
Chirico (figs. 13,14). Other paintings of the period are similarly 
disquieting — a nude seems hermetically sealed in a room with neither 
windows nor doors, an otherwise ordinary couple imbued with an impene- 
trable air of mystery or isolation confronts the viewer, a young boy is lost in 
contemplation (cat. nos. 13, 15, 21). In all instances, there is evidence of 
Rothko's need to compress space, if not flatten it. Whether or not Rothko's 
subways have symbolic meaning is open to conjecture, but certainly these 
paintings suggest a strange, nether region that re-emerges in his Surrealist- 
inspired subterranean fantasies of the mid-1940's. Although these far from 
fully resolved paintings are the efforts of a young artist struggling for clarity 
and identity, the otherworldly mood that infuses them is predictive of

Rothko's mature expression. This mood is the emanation of a fragile, 
precarious and sensitive state of mind that is perfectly evoked by Andre 
Breton's words: "This summer the roses are blue; the wood is made of glass. 
The earth wrapped in its foliage makes as little effect on me as a ghost. Living 
and ceasing to live are imaginary solutions — Existence is elsewhere." 16 
There is in these works an element of calm and a quality of palpable light. 
Later, of course, Rothko was to elevate these characteristics into transcen- 
dent spirituality. 

The 1930's was a period of denial and stagnation rather than affirmative 
personal expression or social progressivism. The government sought to sup- 
port art and artists during the Depression, but succeeded primarily in fostering 
provincial and conservative styles. There were two federal art programs ad- 
ministered by the Treasury Department in the early 1930's — the Public 
Works Art Project and the Section of Painting and Sculpture. Both organiza- 
tions favored the representational styles generally associated with American 
30 Scene painting or Regionalism. Painters could have fulfilled a vital and 

forward-looking social role, but neither they nor the federal government 
understood this at the time. The forces of bureaucracy and individualism in art 
were in conflict. Like all minor artists, the painters encouraged by the 
government did not reach out towards the new but were satisfied to concern 
themselves with what was already known. Their attitude and the government's 
policy did not, however, satisfy the expectations of a young, politically active, 
primarily immigrant group of artists, Rothko among them, as is evident from 
the political and artistic events that took place during the decade of the 
thirties. The more progressive and militant artists formed a number of 
organizations which agitated for the creation of art projects for the unemployed 
and protested the conservative bias of the government's existing programs. 

In 1934, one such group, the Artists' Union, was organized in New 
York, with local chapters elsewhere, to demand the establishment of new 
programs. Rothko was one of approximately two-hundred who participated 
in the inauguration of the Union. The Artists' Union did not confine itself to 
the problems of artists but was involved in different areas of labor as well; 
there was solidarity among the artists and other groups. As Solman has 
pointed out: 

At this time the Artists' Union and the National Maritime Union 
(NMU) were two of the most active participants in aiding striking picket 
lines anywhere in New York City. If the salesgirls went out on strike at 
May's department store in Brooklyn a grouping from the above-mentioned 
unions was bound to swell the picket line. I recall some of our own 
demonstrations to get artists back on the job after a number of pink 
dismissal slips had been given out. At such times everyone was in jeopardy . 
Suddenly from nowhere a truckload of NMU workers would appear and 
jump out onto the sidewalk to join our procession. Cheers welled up from all 
sides. Those were spirited times indeed. ' 7 

In August 1935, the Works Progress Administration, Federal Art 
Project (WPA/FAP) was formed with Holger Cahill as its director. It was the 
most extensive and most effective of all the New Deal art relief programs and 
engaged artists without bias in regard to style. Rothko, together with 
Harris, Solman, Jack Tworkov, Ad Reinhardt, William Baziotes and many 
others, was employed in the WPA's easel project. He was with the project 



from 1936 to 1937, earning $95.44 per month. Small as this stipend was, it 
was the chief support for many of the artists of Rothko's generation. 

Just as Rothko's rebellious nature had earlier drawn him to radical 
politics and an interest in trade unions, so now it led him to join the militant 
Artists' Union and, along with his fellow members, protest the economic 
and social conditions of the Depression, as well as the established order in 
both politics and art. However, it should be noted that, as the writer H. R. 
Hays, who was the artist's friend from 1935, has said, Rothko "had no 
objection to picketing for the immediate preservation of jobs but he strenu- 
ously opposed the injection of politics into art which he felt simply resulted 
in bad art." 18 The revolutionary attitudes that gave rise to these organiza- 
tions continued to exist even into the fifties, when Rothko, Gottlieb, 
Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Newman, Clyfford Still and others 
protested the Metropolitan Museum's prejudice against advanced art. 

In 1934, Rothko joined the newly established Gallery Secession in New 
York, but, in 1935, he and several other artists left it to form a group called 31 

The Ten. This circle rarely consisted of more than nine painters and was 
commonly referred to as "The Ten Who are Nine." It counted among its 
original members, besides Rothko, Gottlieb, Solman, Harris, Ben-Zion, Ilya 
Bolotowsky, Yankel Kufeld, Louis Schanker and Nahum Tschacbasov. Later 
additions were Lee Gatch, John Gtaham, Karl Knaths, Ralph Rosenborg and 
David Burliuk. They exhibited for five years, primarily at galleries in New 
York. Though The Ten was a group of independents with no declared program, 
the majority of its members painted representationally in a loose flat manner 
but were sympathetic to abstract art. Solman relates that at this time Rothko 
and Gottlieb "were both in the spontaneous expressionist or fauve tradi- 
tions." 19 The Ten were much opposed to the conservative styles then dominant 
and interested in such Europeans as Picasso, Matisse and Soutine as well as the 
Americans Avery and Albert Pinkham Ryder. In Solman's words: 

The modern concept of flat space, as in early Matisse, the 1922-26 
still-life period of Picasso and the German Briicke group was also a clear 
force in the work of most of The Ten. We all admired Picasso, Matisse, 
Rouault, Klee and the German expressionists , many of whose works we 
first became acquainted with at J . B. Neumann's New Art Circle and 
later at Paul Rosenberg's and of course at The Museum of Modern Art. 20 



The Ten were rebellious and progressive and in November 1938 they 
held an exhibition called Whitney Dissenters at the Mercury Galleries to 
protest the policies of the Whitney Museum of American Art. As Bernard 
Braddon of Mercury and Rothko wrote in the catalogue of the exhibition, 
"The title of this exhibition is designed to call attention to a significant 
section of art being produced in America. Its implications are intended to go 
beyond one museum and beyond one particular group of dissenters. It is a 
protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting and liberal 
painting. ..." They repudiated both buckeye American painting and obsolete 
European traditions, expressing their intention to "see objects and events as 
though for the first time, free from the accretions of habit and divorced from 
the conventions of a thousand years of painting." 21 

The Ten met monthly at each other's studios. Solman says that Rothko 
was an extremely articulate participant in their discussions. "In argument he 



was brighter than a lawyer and could almost wind out dialogues like a 
Talmudist." 22 The group broke up in 1940, primarily because it had 
outlived its usefulness, as most of the members were becoming more estab- 
lished and were now joining galleries on their own. The Ten parted company 
on friendly terms.

n 1940, Rothko and Solman were given an unparalleled opporruniry to 
participate in a three-man exhibition with Marcel Gromaire at the 
Neumann-Willard Gallery in New York. Both Rothko and Solman were 
delighted with the offer to exhibit on equal terms with a noted French 
painter. Although Rothko's work did not receive much critical attention 
prior to his one-man show at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century in 
New York in 1945, a discerning review of the Neumann-Willard exhibition 
appeared : 

Beside his depth of color, the light and singing hues of Mark Rothko's 
palette seem like a soprano part . Entrance to Subway , with its introduc- 
tion of a green railing lightens a scene usually seen in its gloomy aspects, 
and the peace and quiet of Contemplation is arrived at because of the 
artist's translation of a mood to canvas. This artist has taught children for 
many years, and one feels that they in turn have helped to make him see and 
feel with their own simplicity and instinct for truth. The Party condenses 
the gaiety and high spirits of a children's celebration into a design of real 
structural beauty. 23 

It is striking that the writer has noted the importance of both structural form 
and mood, the appearance of lyrical color and the coexistence of feelings of 
gaiety and contemplation, and thus has perceived salient features of Rothko's 
mature style in these paintings of the late thirties. 

This three-man exhibition notwithstanding, Mark Rothko was virtu- 
ally unknown as a painter at the outbreak of World War II. He had sold 
". . .very few paintings, mostly to friends and other artists." 24 He and his 
first wife, Edith, whom he had married in 1932, lived on meager earnings 
from her jewelry designs and his teaching. Their apartment at 313 East 6th 
Street was both his studio and her shop. Despite Rothko's straitened cir- 
cumstances, the late thirties and early forties were years of tremendous 
significance for his career, an era in which his thinking and his style 
underwent a dramatic evolution. 

In Rothko's works of the thirties such as Crucifixion, Woman Sewing, 
Street Scene (figs. 15-17) and the subway paintings there is tension, doubt and 
striving, a confrontation between the subjects and the demands of the 
architectonic structuring of the compositions. This conflict is most fully 
resolved in the Subway Scene of 1938, but here, as in the earlier canvases, 



33 



Rothko still clings to figuration, unwilling as yet to express the theoretical 
positions he had already begun to crystallize in his notes. The intellectual 
struggle in which he was now engaged was ultimately to take him from these 
relatively conventional paintings to his infinitely more sophisticated style of 
the mid and late forties. As his former wife notes: 

His work changed dramatically in the early 40' s. He and a group of 
painters were much concerned about subject matter and these people met at 
our homes. . . . These meetings involved philosophical discussion . . . there 
were about four or five artists — Gottlieb, Newman, Bolotowsky and 
Tschacbasov. 25 

A spirit of camaraderie developed among painters during this period, 
fostered to a large extent by their participation in the WPA. The easel and 
mural painting projects brought together people of very different 
34 backgrounds and temperaments who might otherwise never have become 

friends. Most of the artists whom Rothko knew around this time — Gottlieb, 
de Kooning, Pollock, Gorky, Newman, David Smith — were, like him, at 
unresolved stages in their development. Their limited resources, their need for 
community, their desire for change, led to friendship. They exhibited to- 
gether, went to shows together, drank together, shared studios, fought with 
each other, picketed, protested and struggled for greatness. They admired the 
work of Miro and Klee well before these artists were accepted in Paris, went to 
see early Kandinsky at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting and were 
especially impressed with the Picassos reproduced in Cahiers d'Art. And they 
became intensely aware of the Surrealist movement, which was gaining 
increasing exposure in the United States in the thirties. 

As early as 1931, the first important exhibition of Surrealism in the 
United States, Newer Super-Realism, had been staged by Arthur Everett 
Austin at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. This show traveled to the 
Julien Levy Gallery in New York the following year. Levy proselytized for 
the movement, showing Surrealist painters throughout the thirties and 
publishing an important anthology, Surrealism, in 1936. This same year, 
Alfred Barr presented the crucial Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The 
Museum of Modern Art. 

None of their past experience, none of the one-man or group exhibi- 
tions they saw had prepared them for the revolution in aesthetics to which 
they now found themselves exposed. These young painters, who formed the 
core of the New York School and were later to be identified as Abstract 
Expressionists, now became conscious that American painting of the 1930s, 
whether the routine academicism of the regional scene painters or the Neo- 
Plasticist dogma of the American Abstract Artists, a group of adherents of 
geometric abstraction which had been established in New York in 1936, was 
extremely limited. Most of this pioneer generation of Abstract Expressionists 
had painted representationally during the Depression years, often under the 
auspices of the WPA. It was thus in a spirit of rebellion, against their own early 
efforts as well as the prevailing American art, that they began the search for a 
new means of expression. The arrival in New York of many major contempor- 
ary European painters at the time of World War II was the catalyst for their 
revolt. The Surrealists — Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Matta, Andre Masson and 
the poet laureate of the movement, Andre Breton — came en masse. Marcel 
Duchamp, of course, was already active here; Piet Mondrian, too, lived and 



worked in New York during the War, as did Fernand Leger, who had already 
spent time in America. These expatriates brought with them an enormous 
vitality, a wealth of new ideas and a sense of the entire history of European 
painting. 

A new awareness of European innovation on the part of Americans is 
indicated in the press release that accompanied the Third Annual Exhibition of 
the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors of June 1943, a show in which 
Rothko participated. The release reads in part: 

At our inception three years ago we stated, "We condemn artistic 
nationalism , which negates the world tradition of art at the base of modern 
art movements. " 

Today America is faced with the responsibility either to salvage and 
develop, or to frustrate Western creative capacity. This responsibility may 
be largely ours for a good part of the century to come. This country has been 
greatly enriched, both by the recent influx of many great European artists, 
some of whom we are proud to have as members of the Federation , and by the 
growing vitality of our native talent. 

In years to come the world will ask how this nation met its opportunity. 
Did it nourish or starve this concentration of talent? 

Since no one can remain untouched by the impact of the present world 
upheaval, it is inevitable that values in every field of human endeavor will 
be affected. As a nation we are being forced to outgrow our narrow political 
isolationism. Now that America is recognized as the center where art and 
artists of all the world meet, it is time for us to accept cultural values on a 
truly global plane. 

Of all the artists in exile in New York, the Surrealists were the most 
influential. Personal contact with the Surrealists, although limited, pro- 
vided the Americans direct access to their work and assured the fledgling 
painters that the legendary Europeans were, after all, human. For all of 
them, it was an exhilarating time, a moment in history that gave them the 
freedom and challenge they needed to cut the cord that tied them to a 
provincial American art. From this alliance with European art and thought 
they created, in a monumental effort, a brilliant new American art. 

Surrealism had been born in Paris in 1924, out of the ashes of Dada. 
According to the Surrealists, the function of the poet or artist was to select 
appropriate symbols, which corresponded in their power and magic to the 
myths, parables and metaphors of the past. These symbols stimulated or 
irritated the senses to arouse multiple associations and emotions, differing 
according to the sensibility of each viewer. Surrealism, like its parent, Dada, 
was antirational in character. The Surrealists developed an art in which the 
formal and rational order of Cubism was replaced by the fantastic, the 
accidental, the illogical. The unconscious was proclaimed as the essential 
source of art; the inner universe of the imagination, rather than the external 
world, became the wellspring of all inspiration. However, the Surrealists 
were not opposed to the reality of the external world as such, but only to 
reason and logic. In fact, they proposed that elements from the external 
world be retained in their work — but that they be unified with the dream to 
form one reality, "surreality."

Surrealists found some ideal tools for their own experiments. The Surrealists 
differed with Freud in their acceptance of dream images as significant 
realities in themselves, rather than as mere symbols of conscious life. His 
observations on the role of language in dream and dream interpretation were 
applied to their own ends. They found Freud's explorations of the mind and 
the investigations of dream imagery inspiration for their own experiments, 
and out of his theories they developed the technique of automatism, which 
they applied to both poetry and painting. In 1924, Breton first described 
Surrealism as "Pure psychic automatism, by which it is intended to express, 
verbally, in writing or by other means, the real process of thought. 
Thought's dictation, in the absence of all control exercised by reason and 
outside all esthetic and moral preoccupations." 26 The purpose of au- 
tomatism was to free art of conscious control, and to liberate the imagina- 
tion. Although much of Surrealism's imagery found its way into American 
painting in the 1940's, it was the technique of automatism that was of most 
crucial importance to the development of a revolutionary art in New York. 

Ernst was an enigmatic and elusive figure who stayed in New York only 
briefly. But his charismatic personality, his reputation as a founder of both 
Dada and Surrealism, his marriage to Peggy Guggenheim and his link to her 
gallery, Art of This Century, attracted the attention of the impressionable 
Americans. He and Masson were among the most influential of the Surrealist 
emigres. Both practiced a form of automatism characterized by all-over 
meandering lines and experimented with a number of unusual materials 
which in themselves suggested images. In Masson's Battle of Fishes, 1926 
(fig. 18), and Ernst's Blue and Pink Doves, 1926, or The Horde, 1927 (figs. 19, 
20), for example, images arise from the chance procedures employed. In 
1942, when he was already in the United States, Ernst began two paintings 
in which he employed a drip technique, Young Man Intrigued by the Flight of a 
Non-Euclidean Fly and The Bewildered Planet (fig. 21). A comparison among 



38 



these Surrealist works and later paintings by Abstract Expressionists, such as 
Pollock's Autumn Rhythm, 1950 (fig. .22), reveals clear similarities. Ernst, of 
course, did not invent the drip technique, and Pollock's work was not 
necessarily based directly upon his example, but more probably upon the 
graceful arabesques of Masson's imagery. In any case, the inspirational force of 
the Surrealists upon the emergent New York School at this time is undeniable. 

Ernst was important to artists like Pollock and Rothko, not only for his 
revolutionary procedures, but for his totemic figuration and relentless de- 
velopment of a series of related images. His example of stylistic consistency 
was extremely significant for the embryonic Abstract Expressionists. And 
Ernst had another, equally vital message for Rothko and his contemporaries: 
he reinforced the young painters' belief in the power of myth and the art of the 
primitive. Rothko's profound interest in archaic cultures, in the art of the 
Aegean and ancient Near East, had originated in the thirties. He was con- 
vinced that myth could be a source and inspiration, not for a literary style of 
painting as might be expected, but for abstraction. And, although Rothko was 
in no sense a literary painter, poetry and philosophy were among the funda- 
mental sources of his thinking. Books such as Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy both 
stimulated and reinforced his interest in myth while he was still painting 
figurative and socially-conscious canvases. 

The form and mythic content of archaic art appeared in Rothko's work 
as early as 1938, when, as we have seen, he started Antigone. By 194 1 he and 
Gottlieb were working closely together to develop and define an art based 
upon myth. Rothko's close friendship with Gottlieb had begun in the late 
1920's. The two held a number of interests and attitudes in common. Both 
loved primitive art — Gottlieb collected, but Rothko did not, probably 
because he preferred not to acquire objects. Gottlieb, like Rothko, was active 
as an organizer of or participant in radical artists' groups. And each was 
intensely concerned with myth. For over a decade, from the mid-thirties to 
the mid-forties, they shared many aesthetic goals; the painting of each artist 
changed from a form of relatively realistic representation common to the

thirties to a fully'developed new language of archetypes. This often laborious 
evolution is reflected in the transition from paintings such as Rothko's 
Subway Scene of 1938 and Gottlieb's Sundeck of 1936 (fig. 23) to Rothko's 
Antigone and The Omen of the Eagle , 1942 (cat. no. 26), and Gottlieb's Eyes 
of Oedipus, 1941, or Pictograph, 1942 (figs. 24, 25). 

Gottlieb's wife, Esther, has commented that both Rothko and her 
husband were extremely programmatic about their artistic direction and 
deliberately chose to concern themselves with myth so that they could break 
with what they considered stagnant in European tradition and with the 
provincial American past. Their ideas were reinforced by other artists like 
Gorky, Newman, Pollock and Still, who were also experimenting with myth 
at around this time. John Graham, whose System and Dialectics of Art was 
published in 1937, stated: 



The purpose of art in particular is to re-establish a lost contact with the 
unconscious . . . with the primordial racial past and to keep and develop 
this contact in order to bring to the conscious mind the throbbing events of 
the unconscious mind. 27 



39 



Rothko and Gottlieb articulated their positions on art and myth in a 
now- famous letter of June 7, 1943, written, with the then unacknowledged 
assistance of Barnett Newman, to The New York Times critic Edward Alden 
Jewell. It was written in response to Jewell's largely negative review of the 
third annual Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors exhibition, re- 
ferred to above. Published in the Times of June 13, it reads in part:

1 . To us art is an adventure into an unknown world, which can be 
explored only by those willing to take the risks. 

2. This world of the imagination is fancy-free and violently opposed to 
common sense. 

3 . It is our function as artists to make the spectator see the world our 
way — not his way. 

4. We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the 
large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal . We wish to 
reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms because they destroy 
illusion and reveal truth. 

5 . It is a widely accepted notion among painters that it does not matter 
what one paints as long as it is well painted. This is the essence of 
academicism. There is no such thing as good painting about nothing. 
We assert that the subject is crucial and only that subject matter is 
valid which is tragic and timeless. That is why we profess spiritual 
kinship with primitive and archaic art. 

Rothko and Gottlieb specifically referred to two of their paintings that had 
been included in the Federation annual, explaining Gottlieb's Rape of Perse- 
phone, 1943 (fig- 26), was "a poetic expression of the essence of the myth," 
and Rothko's The Syrian Bull, 1943 (cat. no. 28), was "a new interpretation 
of an archaic image. . . ." and that "significant rendition of a symbol, no 
matter how archaic, has as full validity today as the archaic symbol had 



then." 28 

From 1941 until 1943, Rothko's paintings are stratified in composi- 
tion, sometimes divided into sharply differentiated registers. Images are 
disposed in an orderly, geometric manner and at times are segregated into 
zones. Bird and animal forms, zigzags, disembodied facial features, anatom- 
ical parts, imagery drawn from archaic sculpture and from architectural 
motifs appear. Paintings such as The Omen of the Eagle, 1942 , point directly to 
the art of Nineveh and Mesopotamia. Rothko fills his zones or registers with 
the part-men, part-beasts, part-gods of ancient legend. The ghostly figures 
of the subway paintings have taken on the relief-like qualities of Near Eastern 
friezes. The architectonic structure of these canvases derives from his own 
work of the thirties, but here it is clarified, compartmentalized and under- 
scored by the registers, reinforced by the fragmented forms that fill each 
zone. Rothko wrote of The Omen of the Eagle as follows: 

40 The theme here is derived from the Agamemnon Trilogy of Aeschylus. The 

picture deals not with the particular anecdote, but rather with the Spirit of 
Myth, which is generic to all myths at all times. It involves a pantheism in 
which man, bird, beast and tree — the known as well as the knowable — 
merge into a single tragic idea. 29 

Although Rothko's symbol-laden imagery of the early 1940's was often 
ponderous, it is sometimes lightened by an element of surprise that derives 
from Surrealist automatism and exploration of chance. In addition, the 
seemingly random composition of paintings such as Untitled, 1939-40 (cat. 
no. 24), in which disparate kinds of images are incorporated in each register, 
may have been inspired by the Surrealists' Cadavres Exquises (exquisite 
corpses). These Cadavres Exquises were collaborative drawings, usually pro- 
duced by three or four artists, each contributing a different kind of image to 
his separate zone of paper. The heavy symbolism and sculptural forms of the 
canvases of the period are mitigated also by Rothko's predominantly pastel 
palette and flat application of color, which continue to reflect Avery's 
sun-drenched hues. 

Rothko's use of the eagle in his paintings of the period, such as The Omen 
of the Eagle, was probably inspired by Ernst's in part humorous and ironic 
identification of himself with the bird, Loplop. The specific symbolism of 
Ernst's birds as representations of power (the eagle is the national emblem of 
both Germany and the United States), of the intellect and freedom of the 
mind may also have influenced Rothko's choice of imagery. Jung, whom 
Rothko was very much interested in, points out that the totem of the bird is 
much used by artists to symbolize transcendence, release, liberation. But the 
painting derives from other sources as well, including motifs from his own 
earlier interiors. Solman mentions, in addition, that Rothko incorporated 
elements from the cornices of buildings and windows in his work at 
this time. 30 Indeed, there seem to be many echoes of thirties ornamentation in 
these paintings. It may also be that the structure of New York buildings rein- 
forced Rothko's decision to divide many of his compositions into registers. 
Furthermore, the zones as well as the eyes, beaks, claws and wings clearly 
refer to Northwest Coast Indian art . 

Although there is a close kinship among concepts and paintings of 
Rothko and Gottlieb, there are profound differences which are clear even in 
their relatively unresolved work of the 1930's. Despite important shared 



goals, sensibility and intent separate Rothko and Gottlieb. Painting 
presented a philosophical dilemma to Rothko, as he came increasingly to 
question its terms and meaning. Gottlieb remained more concerned with the 
hedonistic qualities of his painting and decoration of surface than with 
problems of underlying significance. 

The questioning and conflict that characterize Rothko's work of the late 
thirties are absent from Gottlieb's oeuvre , except in rare paintings such as 
Still Life — Dry Cactus, ca.. 1938 (fig. 27), painted while he was living in the 
desert near Tucson. This canvas is atypical in that it is infused with a mood of 
enigma and foreboding arising from the attenuated shadows which seem to 
entrap theplant forms, and a sense of disorientation resulting from the presen- 
tation of a landscape as a still life and the endowing of plant forms with 
qualities of animal life. The Tanguy- or Dali-like forms that snake across the 
picture are flattened and quite abstract; they are, nevertheless, based on 
observed natural phenomena as well as on Surrealist prototypes. 

Significantly, Gottlieb has chosen a title that might describe a 41 

naturalistic desert scene for his Surreal configurations. An artist like Dali 
would have given his painting a name that enhanced the mystery of its 
images, a title such as Enigma of a Day, for example. Gottlieb's choice of a 
descriptive title underscores his interest in both the natural and super- 
natural. This dichotomy is even more apparent in his later painting, The Sea 
Chest, 1942 (fig. 28). Despite the seemingly straightforward and more 
naturalistic presentation of specimens of marine life there is a pervasive, 
sinister, threatening spirit. However, the Gloucester, Massachusetts, coast 
inspired this canvas, just as the arid desert landscape had been the source of 
Still Life— Dry Cactus. Gottlieb was at this time, and remained, a naturalistic 
painter: his late, abstract burst canvases retain the sense of physical forces and 
phenomena. Gottlieb's basically Impressionist temperament did not allow 
him to pursue his experiments with myth as relentlessly as Rothko did into 
the forties. He continued to be interested in the external world; Rothko by 
the forties was already primarily concerned with inner states of existence. 

Whereas Rothko sometimes segregated his images of this period into 
registers or zones, Gottlieb much more systematically compartmentalized 
his paintings, which he called pictographs, by drawing rather free-form 
grids across his surfaces. In each section of this grid he placed, seemingly at 
random, an image isolated to enhance its emotive powers, adding shape after 
shape until he was satisfied his painting had achieved its final form. Some of 
his images — eyes, faces, teeth, genitalia or other parts of the human 
anatomy — are the residual data of his earlier interest in the human figure. 
They are part of a repertory of image-symbols — others include snakes, birds, 
masks, eggs — that he discovered in past art forms which appeared to him to 
have a universal significance or, in Jungian terms, to form part of a "collec- 
tive unconscious." Gottlieb continued to produce pictographs, however, as 
abstract forms devoid of mythic content, into the mid-1950's. 

But myths as interpreted by Rothko, Gottlieb and other Americans in 
the forties did not convey universal meaning; the Americans failed to express 
through myth the truths of the collective unconscious or the brutalities of their 
own time. The master Picasso, alone among twentieth-century artists, was able 
to make mythology profoundly relevant in his monumental Guernica, 1937 
(fig. 29). Here he draws upon both Surrealist and mythological prototypes, 
but endows them with genuinely modern form and content. Guernica is at 
once shocking in its contemporaneity and timeless in its references to the past 



and thus stands not only for the Spanish Civil War but for all war. Past and 
present have been dramatically synthesized on a level of epic grandeur. 

Picasso's achievement was unparalleled, however, and artists like 
Rothko and Gottlieb were unable to endow their paintings with the rele- 
vance they insisted was inherent in myth. Removed from their original 
culture, the symbols lose their context, the connective tissue which is crucial 
to their meaning and use; they become abstract signs without significant 
mythic content. Their entirely intellectual and programmatic approach was

fundamentally different from Picasso's deeply felt synthesis of emotion and 
intellect. Nevettheless, Rothko and Gottlieb sought to make myth the 
centtal focus of a new aft fotm in theit attempt to assett theit linkage with 
European tradition as well as the coming of age and, finally, the ptimacy of 
American art. Their search for the "timeless" in art was in part a search for a 
new vocabulary. This new vocabulary was rooted in, but ultimately inde- 
pendent of, Surrealism, from which it drew its main inspiration. That the 
archaism of the art of the ancient Near East had little direct bearing on the 
search for the new did not seem to disturb Rothko at this time. Avant-garde 
painters working in New York in the forties were presented with an enorm- 
ous range of possibilities and, in keeping with the catholic attitudes of 
twentieth-century artists, were able to use the primitive to break with the 
past. There was, however, a very real contradiction between what these 
artists saw as a "spiritual kinship" with primitive and archaic art and the 
new, as well as a conflict with what they achieved in their mature painting. 
The Surrealists had combined ancient myth and Freudian symbolism, 
thus justifying their imagery in literary and scientific tetms. For Rothko and 
his colleagues such subject matter was ultimately inhibiting. They drew 
upon it in an interim period, creating paintings that were poetic in their 
metaphors and transitional in form, as they progressed towards a new art. 
The Surrealists sought archetypal images to represent the highly charged 
world of their subconscious minds. But the future Abstract Expressionists 
developed a vocabulary of signs, not to symbolize the super-reality of the real 
world merged with dreams and the unconscious but to express the teality of 
a revolutionary abstract art. They released themselves from the past when they 
abandoned their commitment to the primitive and the literary and consecrated 
themselves to the realm of pure painting.

44 J. he last years of World War II were a time of great activity for Rothko and 

his colleagues. In 1944, Gottlieb was elected head of the Federation of 
Modern Painters and Sculptors, a position he retained until 1945. In 
December df 1944, the 67 Gallery, which Howard Putzel had opened in 
New York that fall, mounted an exhibition of Forty American Moderns, in 
which Rothko participated, showing an untitled Surrealist drawing. Putzel, 
Peggy Guggenheim's assistant from 1942-44, had advised her to represent 
Rothko, and in January of 1945 she gave him a one-man show at her gallery. 
Art of This Century. The catalogue preface reads: 

Rothko 's painting is not easily classified. It occupies a middle ground 
between abstraction and surrealism. In these paintings the abstract idea is 
incarnated in the image. Rothko 's style has a latent archaic quality which 
the pale and uninsistent colours enforce. This particular archaization. the 
reverse of the primitive, suggests the long savouring of human and tradi- 
tional experience as incorporated in the myth. Rothko 's symbols, fragments 
of myth, are held together by a free, almost automatic calligraphy that 
gives a peculiar unity to his paintings — a unity in which the individual 
symbol acquires its meaning, not in isolation, but rather in its melodic 
adjustment to the other elements in the picture. It is this feeling of internal 
fusion, of the historical conscious and subconscious capable of expanding 
far beyond the limits of the picture space that gives Rothko s work its force 
and essential character. But this is not to say that the images created by 
Rothko are the thin evocations of the speculative intellect; they are rather 
the concrete, the tactual expression of the intuitions of an artist to whom the 
subconscious represents not the farther, but the nearer shore of art. 31 

Among the fifteen paintings in this exhibition were Sacrifice of Iphigenia. 
1942 , The Syrian Bull, 1943 , Birth of Cephalopods , Slow Swirl at the Edge of the 
Sea and Poised Elements, all of 1944 (cat. nos. 29,28, 37,63, 3 1). The titles of 
these works clearly indicate that Rothko's concern with myth and ritual, 
prehistoric forces, biological life in general, marine organisms in particular, 
was still very strong at this time. 

There is, however, no consistent relationship between Rothko's titles 
and his imagery. Thus, the forms in paintings as variously named as Slow 
Swirl at the Edge of the Sea, Birth of Cephalopods and Tiresias are extremely 
similar to one another. Poised Elements, on the other hand, is much more 



structured; its geometrically disposed forms seem to be derived from late 
Kandinsky and have little to do with the liquid grace and curvilinear shapes 
of the three other canvases, in which natural phenomena, mythic content, 
Surrealist automatic technique and subconscious imagery are successfully 
synthesized. The Ernst-like Hierarchical Birds (fig. 30) represents yet another 
direction Rothko was now exploring. In fact, he was still absorbing a 
multitude of influences — he himself said that Dali, de Chirico, Miro and 
Ernst attracted him at this time. Thus, Entombment I, 1946 (cat. no. 42), 
recalls Picasso's studies for Crucifixion, 1927 (for example, fig. 31), many 
gouaches resemble Ernst's Shell Flowers, 1929 (fig- 32), and others bring to 
mind the work of his contemporaries, such as Motherwell's Indians, 1944 
(fig. 33). Therefore, it is incorrect to classify, as many critics have done, this 
phase of his oeuvre as biomorphic — although his best work of the period may 
be so categorized. 

Just as the Subway Scene of 1938 represents the climax of Rothko's first 
mature work of the thirties, so Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea, Birth of 45 

Cephalopods and Rites of Lilith, 1945 (cat. no. 39), are the culmination of 
Rothko's search for the "middle ground between surrealism and abstrac- 
tion." In these and related paintings of the mid-forties, Rothko creates a 
series of ritualistic or totemic images which vaguely suggest human figures, 
birds, animals, aquatic life. The animation of twirling or revolving forms, 
sensitivity to nuance of color, shape and detail and careful balance of large 
and small areas in these lyrical works are unexcelled. Rothko now achieves a 
synthesis of form, line and color which rivals that of the best Surrealist 
painting of the period. 

Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea was painted during the artist's courtship 
of his second wife, Mary Alice Beistle (Mell), and thus had special meaning 
for him — it may, in fact, be a symbolic portrait of the couple. (Although it 
at one time belonged to the San Francisco Museum of Art it was traded back 
to Rothko in 1961 and remained in his home until his wife's death in 1970.) 

The paintings of 1944-45 reveal that by now Rothko had begun to 
make important advances in a new direction. He starts now to enlarge his 
paintings — Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea is 75 by SAV2 inches and Rites of 
Lilith, 84 by 108 inches. A comparison between SlowSwirl and the earlier The 
Omen of the Eagle (cat. no. 26) is illuminating and shows the extent to which 
Rothko's style had by now evolved. The forms of The Omen of the Eagle are 
divided into four clearly defined registers; the later work, however, contains 
semitransparent images that appear to float and merge with the soft, translu- 
cent ground like aquatic organisms in a liquid medium. Rothko has 
banished the bulging, bulky figures of The Omen of the Eagle, throwbacks to 
his expressionist work of the twenties and thirties, and employed instead 
weightless forms and a soft, light palette reminiscent of the subway paint- 
ings of the thirties. 

Rothko's interest in myth lessened as the abstract possibilities inherent 
in Surrealism increasingly intrigued him. The Miro- and Masson-influenced 
Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea and Rites of Lilith are gracefully calligraphic, 
more markedly linear than the paintings that preceded them. Like Gorky, 
who was working in a similar direction at this time, as revealed in his The 
Liver is the Cock's Comb, \9AA (fig. 34), Rothko cultivated anthropomorphic 
forms within a generally diffused field. But Rothko, unlike Gorky, or for 
that matter, most of the Surrealists, uses little sexual imagery. The two 
painters undoubtedly were drawing upon common sources, but did not

markedly influence one another. In most of his canvases of 1944 to 1946 
Rothko uses an all-over ground, usually of a pale creamy color with a few 
bright accents. His images are generally flat and without real physical 
presence. Only rarely, as in the very Gorky-like Aquatic Drama, 1946 (cat. 
no. 59), do these shapes become overtly organic or three-dimensional. Nor is 
there any concession to the deep illusionistic space of Matta and Tanguy. 

Rothko wished to establish light as an integral part of his painting. His 
use of oils, however, tended to dim the luminosity he sought, even in the 
otherwise masterful Slow Swirl. So disposed was he to effects of luminosity 
that he began to prefer watercolor and gouache to oil paints. And, in works of 
1945 to 1947, such as Entombment I and Entombment II, both 1946 (cat. nos. 
42, 43), Rothko returned to the smaller scale of his paintings prior to the 
1940's and restricted his color range to the greys and earth colors typical of 
his canvases of the early forties. No doubt he found it easier to concentrate on 
developing effects of luminosity and loosening his imagery when working 
48 with this restricted scale and palette. The luminosity, flatness, frontality and 

close-value colors ascribed to the period of Rothko's great breakthrough in 
1949-50 are already characteristic of these watercolors and pastels of the 
mid-1940's. Many of them are among his most beautiful works. Contrary to 
the opinion of some critics, who maintain that Rothko could not draw, and 
even of the artist himself, the calligraphy of this period is brilliant. Now, 
perhaps for the first time, he allows a Miroesque element of play, if not 
humor, to enter his heretofore solemn, even stern paintings. There is about 
them a decided air of confidence, accomplishment and quiet pleasure. Their 
forms, almost liberated from myth and referential imagery, border as never 
before on the totally abstract and are brought into perfect harmony with the 
formal requirements of the picture plane. Although Rothko's imagery of this 
period has often been characterized as aquatic, it is too ambiguous and 
complicated to be so defined. His forms are far less explicit than those of 
Baziotes, who, also influenced by Miro, truly did invent a vocabulary of 
aquatic, biomorphic imagery (fig. 35). Rothko's foreground and background 
are in a state of flux; nevertheless, the picture plane remains stable and 
constant. Rothko asserted this stability as well as the flatness of the picture 
plane by working with strictly horizontal-vertical axes, crossing his vertical 
canvases with horizontal bands upon which he placed vertically oriented 
shapes. 

In these watercolors, Rothko no longer allows concern with symbolic 
meaning to stand in the way of abstract considerations, but he does not 
entirely renounce his fealty to myth or representational imagery. Rothko had 
now only to eliminate the last barrier, the vestiges of figuration that 
remained in his work, to create a revolutionary new art form. He was, 
however, not yet prepared to take this final step. As he said in 1945: 

/ adhere to the material reality of the world and the substance of things. I 
merely enlarge the extent of this reality, extending to it coequal attributes 
with experiences in our more familiar environment . I insist upon the equal 
existence of the world engendered in the mind and the world engendered by 
God outside of it. If I have faltered in the use of familiar objects, it is 
because I refuse to mutilate their appearance for the sake of an action which 
they are too old to serve; or for which, perhaps, they had never been 
intended. 

I quarrel with surrealist and abstract art only as one quarrels with his 



father and mother; recognizing the inevitability and function of my roots, 
but insistent upon my dissension: I, being both they, and an integral 
completely independent of them. 

The surrealist has uncovered the glossary of the myth and has established a 
congruity between the phantasmagoria of the unconscious and the objects of 
everyday life. This congruity constitutes the exhilarated tragic experience 
which for me is the only source book for art. But I love both the object and 
the dream far too much to have them effervesced into the insubstantiality of 
memory and hallucination. The abstract artist has given material exis- 
tence to many unseen worlds and tempi. But I repudiate his denial of the 
anecdote just as I repudiate the denial of the material existence of the whole 
of reality. For art to me is an anecdote of the spirit, and the only means of 
making concrete the purpose of its varied quickness and stillness . 

Rather be prodigal than niggardly I would sooner confer anthropomorphic 
attributes upon a stone, than dehumanize the slightest possibility of

By 1947, however, Rothko had begun to formulate his mature style. 
He broke with Surrealism and purged the remnants of this style from his 
work. Many of his colleagues did the same, and by 1950 most of the leading 
members of the New York School had forged their own highly individualis- 
tic art forms. Nevertheless, Rothko continued to experiment with a variety 
of possibilities and still exhibited, even in 1948, earlier works characterized 
by biomorphic imagery. Thus Archaic Fantasy and Rites of Lilith, both of 
1945 , were seen in his first one-man show at Betty Parsons in 1947 and Poised 
Elements, 1944, Phalanx of the Mind, 1945, Dream Imagery, Beginnings, Com- 
panionship and Solitude were included in his 1948 show at this same gallery. 
However, as critics of the 1948 presentation noted, Rothko's newer works 
indicated a striking departure into pure abstraction. The writer in Art News

says, "Loose clouds of color appear to float on the surface; a palette opposing 
one intense hue with pastel modulations creates a spacious effect. Vaguely 
evoking the colot patterns of Bonnard, Rothko achieves lovely textures and 
moods." 33 The New York Times reviewer notes that the paintings are mural- 
size, divested of content and identified with numbers rather than associative 
titles. He remarks that one is Redon-like in its color harmonies and that 
Rothko is attempting "to avoid arresting the raw life in the pigment or the 
flow of its movement by any kind of definition. . . ," 34 Both critics consi- 
dered the paintings unresolved, and the Times writer said Rothko had 
reached an "impasse of empty formlessness, an art solely of transitions 
without beginning, middle or end." 35 

Rothko experimented during 1947 with horizontal supports instead of 
using the near-square or pronouncedly vertical formats with which he had 
formerly seemed most at ease. Once again, oil replaces watercolor. Large 
color forms of diffuse but generally rectangular shape supplant the overtly 
biomorphic imagery of the ptevious years, as the artist attempts to purify his 
work of all associative elements. The Surrealist morphology of the 1944-46 
paintings, which had displaced the mythic imagery of the preceding period, 
is now itself eliminated. In its stead is color, color as abstract shape, color in 
large and small units juxtaposed with one anothet . Despite Rothko's deliber- 
ate movement towards total abstraction, these are still clearly transitional 
works. In several canvases, the horizontal compositional orientation as well 
as the configurations of the color-shapes themselves are still referential and 
convey the distinct impression of landscape. 

This is especially apparent in Number 24. 1948 (fig. 36), where the top 
edge of the middle block of color suggests a horizon line, and the gentle 
curves or sloping contours of the beach or countryside are alluded to, but not 
specifically depicted. While they may not be particularly successful or 
resolved, paintings of this kind reveal the confluence of a number of ideas and 
forces and thus offer a most interesting insight into Rothko's development. 
In Number 24 , the residue of the past remains in echoes of Marin and, through 
him, Cezanne — the encircling border-within-the-frame, the use of oil in the 
manner of watercolor and the general, if ambiguous, reference to landscape.

There are reminders of Avery, too, in the pastoral ambience and flattening of 
form. Yet another, more contemporary artist has left his imprint on Rothko's 
work of this time: Number 24 and other paintings of the period clearly call to 
mind Clyfford Still. 

Rothko had expressed his admiration for Still in an introduction he 
wrote for the catalogue of this painter's one-man exhibition at Peggy 
Guggenheim's Art of This Century in 1946. Rothko's text reads in part: 

// is significant that Still, working out West and alone, has arrived at 
pictorial conclusions so allied to those of the small band of Myth Makers 
who have emerged here during the war. The fact that his is a completely 
new facet of this idea, using unprecedented forms and completely personal 
methods, attests further to the vitality of this movement. Bypassing the 
current preoccupation with genre and the nuances of formal arrangements, 
Still expresses the tragic-religious drama which is generic to all Myths at 
all times, no matter where they occur. He is creating new counterparts to 
replace the old mythological hybrids who have lost their pertinence in the 
intervening centuries. 

For me, Still's pictorial dramas are an extension of the Greek Persephone 
Myth. As he himself has expressed it, his paintings are "of the Earth, the 
Damned and of the Recreated. 



»36 



Still, like Rothko, was interested in ritualistic subject matter and 
archaic forms as early as 1938, as evidenced, for example, by his Totemic 
Fantasy of that year. And, although Rothko included him in the band of 
"Myth Makers" with which he himself was aligned, Still wished to remain 
independent of any group or movement and later repudiated this statement. 
In fact, Still was to maintain that the paintings in the show, which had titles 
like Nemesis of Esther HI , Buried Sun and Theopathic Entities , had been named by 
someone other than himself. Still was an isolated figure, very much in the 
manner of Gauguin; the example he provided of an individual working alone, 
competing on the fringe of a peer group, without direct peer pressure, was as 
important to Rothko as the inspiration of his form, color and concept of 
painting. Certain of Still's works of the early 1940's, such as Jamais, 1944 (fig. 
37), reflect Surrealist influence, particularly that of Miro. Later in the forties 
he rejected European influence, a renunciation that was extremely significant 
to Rothko. As Still said, "I have not 'worked over' the imagery or gimmicks of 
the past, whether Realist, Surrealist, Expressionist, Bauhaus, Impressionist, 
or what you choose. I went back to my own idioms, envisioned, created and 
thought through. And the insight gained and the momentum established 
altered the character of the whole concept of the practice of painting." 37 Still, 
whose individualistic temperament was ill-suited to the New York art world, 
returned after a brief stay during 1945-46 in this city to his teaching job at the 
California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. However, in the short time he 
was in New York, he was undeniably an important catalyst and played a 
significant role in Rothko's liberation from Surrealism. 

It was to Still that Rothko looked in 1946. The imprint of Still's style is 
apparent in the horizontal disposition of shapes with hooked and jagged 
contours in a number of Rothkos of 1946 and shortly thereafter, including the 
aforementioned Number 24 and Untitled, 1946 (cat. no. 72). These elements 
may be traced to paintings such as Still's 1945-H (fig. 38), which he showed to 
Rothko, Peggy Guggenheim and others in the fall of 1945 in New York in his

Perry Street studio. 38 In addition, Still's skillful manipulation of color, shape 
and texture and his ability to create flickers of light by placing small areas of 
color at the edges of his canvas and scattered throughout the field must have 
impressed Rothko and certainly influenced his work of 1946-47. Still's later 
equation of color as space, as well as his commitment to stylistic consistency 
reinforced Rothko's own inclinations. And Rothko and Still shared a basically 
romantic attitude towards nature and painting itself — both spoke about their 
feelings of awe before the grandeur of nature and of their kinship with such 
artists as Turner and Matisse. There were facets of Still's style, however, that 
were inherently alien to Rothko's sensibility — Still's quite consistent use of 
large areas of black (a color Rothko generally avoided until the late 1960's) and 
the cavernous depths or void that it implied, his sharp and dramatic contrasts 
of positive and negative shapes and light and dark areas, the thick skin of his 
heavily encrusted paint surface. There is, in addition, a rawness and brutality 
in Still's work that aligns him with the gestural branch of Abstract Expres- 
sionism. These characteristics are very much at odds with Rothko's serene and 
orderly expression. 

Rothko was undoubtedly a conduit of ideas from New York to Still. It is 
conceivable, therefore, that he may have acted, at least in part, as a catalyst in 
Still's stylistic quantum leap between 1945 and 1948. Still was a source of 
continuing inspiration for Rothko, and the two artists were in frequent 
contact. Rothko went to San Francisco to teach at the California School of 
Fine Arts during the summer of 1947 . Still made a brief visit to New York in 
the spring of 1947 and again in the summer of 1948 to discuss the formation 
of The Subjects of the Artist School with Rothko, Baziotes, David Hare and 
Motherwell. Upon Still's recommendation, Rothko was invited to teach in 
San Francisco for a second time, during the summer of 1949- Still lent 
Rothko his studio that summer, and it was there that he saw Still's fully 
resolved painting 1947-8-W No. 2 (fig. 39). When Rothko returned to New 
York, he borrowed the painting and hung it in his New York apartment for 
six years. Although it has been stated that "Rothko developed his final style 
after seeing Still's large black 1947-8-W," 39 Rothko had, in fact, already 
formulated his mature style by that time. 

Still crystallized his characteristic imagery some time before Rothko did. 
He did not, however, achieve the heroic proportions of his fully realized style 
until 1949, when Rothko was already on the verge of his own breakthrough. 
Still and Rothko remained close for many years, and, as we have seen, Still's 
painting clearly helped to liberate Rothko. However, Rothko's contemplative 
mature formulation derives not from the basically expressionist work of Still 
but from his own unique sensibility. 

By 1947, Rothko begins to introduce larger color shapes (cat. no. 73). 
The size of the canvas itself generally remains modest, however, in this 
period of emerging abstraction. Rothko also starts to break away from the 
practice of confining images to zones. To release his patches of color and 
allow them to float, he sometimes renounces the vertical-horizontal grid 
structure and the division of the background planes into horizontal bands 
which had dominated his work from the time of the subway paintings. This 
abandonment of the balanced rectilinear structure to which he was so 
obviously drawn is a rather unexpected departure. However, even the quite 
freely disposed compositions of the period convey the sense of order and 
harmony we have come to expect of Rothko's expression. 

Freed from Surrealist imagery, Rothko is now able to experiment with 



numerous formal alternatives: he compresses a multitude of shapes and colors 
in the middle of large fields, reduces his compositions to relatively few blocks 
of color, allows his forms to merge with the grounds upon which they are 
placed and begins for the first time to achieve a wholistic image. The general 
atmosphere of freedom and the belief in limitless possibilities which pre- 
vailed in the New York art world in the 1940's must have encouraged 
Rothko to attempt such varied and sometimes uncharacteristic solutions. 

Rothko's insistence in many of his paintings upon a horizontal-vertical 
structure was very much in keeping with the practices of a number of his New 
York School colleagues. As Meyer Schapiro has pointed out, ". . .Surrealist 
painting was infected with literature, and it was only in a milieu of artists 
who also admired the Cubists and Mondrian that abstraction could take over 
some of the functions that Surrealism assigned to imagery." 40 The preference 
for the grid that the Cubists and Mondrian espoused was not a restraining but 
a liberating influence in the development of Rothko and his contemporaries, 
in that it helped offset this "infection of literature." Mondrian's geometric 53 

abstraction affected figures as diverse as de Kooning and Rothko, Newman 
and Reinhardt. These younger artists were attracted to both the formal and 
metaphysical aspects of Mondrian's pure abstraction. Like the Surrealists, 
Mondrian sought a visual system to express inner states and transcendent 
meaning. Indeed, Mondrian once said to Max Ernst, "It is not you but I who 
am the Surrealist." 41 But unlike the Surrealists, Mondrian created his 
super-reality within the strictures of pure geometry. 

Rothko's sensibility is in many respects close to Mondrian's. His 
attraction to order, stability, rectilinear structure and balanced asymmetry, 
his developing sense of the need to express a Platonic ideal, a higher spiritual 
or metaphysical truth through abstract form, are all clearly related to 
Mondrian's own goals. Despite Mondrian's personal asceticism and aesthetic 
purity, he expresses in his painting a rich, if highly controlled vein of emotion. 
Rothko recognized this and spoke of the "sensuousness of Mondrian," respond- 
ing to the complex and often contradictory nature of his art. 

Mondrian's grid divides the space of his surface plane into multiple 
units. His primary colors anchor the grid within the field but also, in 
interacting with the black lines that surround them, create spatial am- 
biguity. Thus, color and line perform dual roles and enhance rather than 
reduce the complexity of the image. Rothko, on the other hand, even in his 
paintings of 1947-48, diminishes the complicating effect of color relation- 
ships by eliminating black and white and either subduing the value contrasts 
among his colors or sensitively balancing his contrasting hues so that they all 
appear to hover on the same plane. Thus, unlike Mondrian's shapes, which 
seem to advance and retreat in space, Rothko's color forms achieve a uniform- 
ity of spatial play as they hold a single plane in a manner entirely consistent 
with his emphasis on the two-dimensional picture surface. Mondrian relied 
upon the black and white grid to contain his compositions and color, which 
he restricted to the primaries. Rothko, however, abandons all but the most 
minimal references to a rectilinear scaffolding and allows his widely varied 
and subtle color to act almost independently and at its maximum level of 
luminosity. Rothko's color is the substance of his art. Yet it is dematerialized 
and in this respect, too, most unlike Mondrian's dense color. 

In addition, Mondrian establishes a frame — his grid — within a frame 
— the small rectangle of the canvas. His compositions are compartment- 
alized and consist of small discrete units. The viewer is forced to stand back 



54 



and examine the whole painting in order to understand how the forms and 
colors interact with one another. Rothko, on the other hand, enlarges and 
isolates small surface incidents, for example, patches of color. These enlarged 
details and, in the later work, the heroic proportions of the canvases engulf 
the viewer, immersing him in the totality of the overall image. 

Newman, who became close friends with Rothko in the 1930's, had, 
like Rothko, been an ardent advocate of Surrealism in the mid-1940's. He 
produced a number of Surrealist drawings and watercolors, executing his 
automatic, frottage-like drawings first in black and white and, then, in 
1944, adding color with grease and oil crayons as in The Blessing (fig. 40). 
Calligraphic, heavily textured and improvisational oils followed, featuring 
circular (female) forms and vertical (male) elements. Works such as Pagan 
Void, 1946, and Genetic Moment , 1947 (fig. 4 1), suggest creation and genesis. 

Mondrian's influence on Newman was perhaps even more pronounced 
than on Rothko. In his writings, Newman developed a personal and highly 
intellectual concept of painting. This formulation of his ideology enabled 
him to achieve his characteristic mature style as early as 1948: solid color 
fields interrupted by vertical stripes or "zips" of another color or tone. By 
1949, he had enlarged his canvases to heroic scale and he ultimately carried 
the idea of the expansive color field further than either Rothko or Still. Both 
Rothko and Newman focused upon a small section of the grid, enlarged it 
and utilized it to structure color and space. But, in contradistinction to 
Rothko's usual practice of working with horizontal bands of color within a 
vertical or near-square field, Newman chose, by about 1950, to orient his 
paintings horizontally and subdivide them vertically with one or more 
"zips." And in his mature painting, for example, Vir Heroicus Sublimis, 
1950-5 1 (fig. 42), Newman eliminates much of the texture that had marked 
the grounds of his earlier canvases to produce neutral, wall-like fields most 
unlike Still's heavy impasto and Rothko's atmospheric surfaces. 

Mondrian's effect on Newman is seen in his use of red and blue, with 
which he made some of his most majestic statements. To be sure, Newman 
experimented with many colors other than the primaries, and his colors are 
true only in late works such as Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue, I— IV, 
1966-70. Newman may tint his colors so that they lose their precision, but 
he makes a statement about a field of a single, specific color. Rothko, on the 
other hand, is concerned with relationships among varied and modulated 
colors. Despite Newman's rejection of pronounced texture, his field is not 
entirely flat and unmodulated. He activates his surface with his brushstrokes 
and his "zips," which he creates by masking off a section of the canvas, 
painting over the tape and allowing the pigment to bleed or seep underneath. 
The pronounced frontality and verticality of the "zip" in contrast to the 
lateral expanse of the field creates a sensation of deep space and the void 
which brings him closer to Still than it does to Rothko, who chooses to keep 
his shallow color-space in flux. 

Rothko, Newman and Still purify their art by rejecting the decorative 
qualities of paint, by ridding their canvases of complex relationships of color, 
form and structure. They reduce color to its essence and make it become 
volume, form, space and light. Having emptied their paintings of the 
superfluous, they are able to express both the material reality of abstract 
painting and the incorporeal reality of the sublime. Art for all of them 
becomes an act of revelation, of exaltation, an embodiment of universal 
truth.

As Rothko increasingly simplified his painting, he freed himself from 
dependence upon the examples of other artists and approached the domain 
of his own hegemony, his unique, mature expression. Elements of this 
resolved style appear in the paintings of 1948-49 which Rothko designated 
as multiforms, but not until the winter of 1949-50 does he achieve a fully 
unified, consistent vision. Numerous works of 1949 (see cat. nos. 89, 92) 
reveal an artist liberated in terms of color. Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on 
White and Red, of 1949 (cat. no. 90), for example, reflects Rothko function- 
ing at the highest level of intuition and is predictive of his unsurpassed 
mature color statements . 

In these multiforms, Rothko is inexorably moving beyond mythic 
subject matter and Surrealist forms to replace imagery with color. This is not 
to say that certain aspects of the painting of the preceding period are not 
carried over into the new work, for, in fact, traces of such elements, primarily 
in the form of a residual calligraphy, do appear in canvases such as Multiform, 
1948, and Number 22, 1949 (cat. nos. 70, 91). These linear elements, which 
Rothko renounces entirely in his work of the 1950's, however, no longer 
carry the weight of representational or symbolic allusions but are largely 
formal in intent. In this transitional stage, Rothko cannot yet allow his color 
and shape to stand alone. He still feels impelled to define the picture plane 
and emphasize the importance of his surface with these markings. Thus, he 
places a series of short parallel strokes adjacent to a patch of color or he scores 
the paint surface with lines or outlines a block of pigment. Sometimes he 
draws with a thin line of color just inside the canvas edge to call attention to the 
picture plane and produce an effect of a strip of light — this border of light he 
was later able to create, without recourse to line, by juxtaposing areas of pure 
color. Dots, dashes, dragged lines, indeterminate contours, all are used to 
activate the surfaces of the multiforms, as Rothko more and more severely 
restricts their compositions and reduces the shapes in them to a few simple 
slabs of color. 

The process of clarification has already started in Multiform, 1948 (cat. 
no. 70): here both horizontal and vertical, large and small shapes are disposed 



55 




56 



seemingly at random within the field. A number of colots act at once as 
discrete entities and merge together, unified, as they are reduced to a single 
intensity. Dashes and drips are the only reminders of Rothko's former 
fascination with Surrealist automatism. More advanced is the luminous 
Number 19, 1949 (cat. no. 88), where the internal configurations are en- 
larged and simplified and the structural role of color increases in importance, 
as linear surface incident is diminished. Despite the general pattern of 
development that may be discerned in these paintings, Rothko's evolution is 
not absolutely consistent, his direction not entirely certain, as Number 18, 
1948-49 (cat. no. 77), indicates. In this canvas, he once again resorts to a 
multiplicity of lines, shapes and colors. And in another work of 1948 (cat. 
no. 84), he chooses a fairly simple format and uses relatively few colors and 
shapes, but he reveals that he is still unable to attain a complete formal 
resolution. Because this canvas is exaggeratedly narrow, the areas of color 
seem too large to be comfortably contained within it. The painting should be 
executed on a much larger scale, a scale Rothko was to successfully employ 
barely one year later. 

The characteristics of Rothko's mature style emerge with increasing 
force in paintings of 1949 like Untitled, Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White 
and Red and Number 22 (cat. nos. 89-91). The two latter works form an 
interesting comparison. Number 22 is unusually large (it measures 9 feet 9'/2 
inches by 8 feet 10% inches) for this date. It is quite unwieldy, as Rothko 
seems to have found it difficult to take command of the painting's space: the 
proportions of the internal rectangles are rather awkwardly adjusted to the 
dimensions of the canvas; the somewhat clumsy relationship of the internal 
shapes to one another is uncharacteristically out of balance and inharmoni- 
ous. The painting is a field of abrasive yellow with a narrow stripe of a 
related, harsh hue inserted near its top; close to the center is a broader and 
wider band of deep red, which almost touches either side of the canvas. 
Within the red area, three white lines thread their way, lines which perhaps 
recall Miro, for example, his The Hunter (Catalan Landscape), 1923-24 (fig. 
43), and are among the last vestiges of Surrealist automatic calligraphy in 
Rothko's work. Curiously, these skeins probably also refer to that wizard of 
Dada, Duchamp, for in their disposition within the composition they recall 
the linear elements in works such as Network of Stoppages , Paris, 1914 (fig. 
44). Although Rothko never acknowledged a debt to Duchamp, the Dada 
master may have influenced some of his early Surrealist-inspired works — 
Rothko's Untitled, 1945 (cat. no. 62), for example, has the quality of a 
mirror image and resembles Duchamp's the Large Glass, 1915-23 (fig- 45), 
in its general organization. And Duchamp capitalized upon chance in his art 
and was, in this, a precursor of Surrealist automatism. The existence of a link 
between Duchamp and Rothko remains an intriguing if hitherto unexplored 
possibility. Number 22, then, reflects the past and also, in its extreme 
reduction and large scale, points to the future. 

The awkwardness and harshness of this transitional work are in direct 
contrast to the much more fully resolved Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on 
White and Red. In this painting, the significant elements of Rothko's mature 
style are not only clearly in evidence but are unified: he employs a series of 
horizontals within a vertical format and harmony is achieved by means of 
precise adjustment of a drastically reduced number of shapes and colors. This 
order is in no sense mechanical or based upon predetermined calculation; it is 
exquisitely sensitive and intuitive.

In Violet, Black, Orange, Yellow on White and Red, Rothko reveals one of 
the supreme features of his genius — his ability to hold on a single plane 
colors that advance and retreat. He achieves this through relatively simple 
means. The large violet shape in the uppermost portion of the canvas is far 
heavier than the smaller bands of orange and yellow below it. Rothko 
prevents this rectangle from toppling because of its weight by anchoring it 
with the thin band of black directly below it and with two vertical red bars 
which, despite their narrowness, effectively counter the strength of the violet 
mass. Furthermore, the soft yellow and white ground lends added density to 
the lower half of the painting and reinforces an otherwise recessive area. 

Rothko by now had enlarged and neutralized his forms, allowing color 
to breathe. Color does not allude to landscape, as it had only a few years 
before, nor is it any longer a secondary element which supports shape. Color 
has come to stand for form. Absolutely crucial to his color expression is 
Rothko's paint handling, which evolved from his Surrealist watercolors. It is 
basically a watercolor technique translated into oil. Paint is soaked into the 
very fiber of the canvas, so that color seems dematerialized, a characteristic 
effect of Rothko's most successful late work. The intensity and warmth of 
hues (he often favors yellow, orange, violet, red) and an extreme sensuousness 
of pigment would seem to be at odds with this quality of dematerialization. 
But Rothko's color is full of contradictions. He frequently remarked he did 



57 




not wish color to be accepted at face value, asserting that datk paintings 
could be mote cheerful than light ones, bright color more serious than deep 
hues. Rothko's goal was to make color both area and volume, emotion and 
mood, at once palpable and disembodied, sensuous yet spiritual. Fot colot 
represents something larger than its own sheet physical presence. Rothko has 
come to think of color as the doorway to another reality. 

Rothko himself said that he was not interested in color for its own sake. 
Nor did he want to be labeled — and limited — as an abstract painter. "I'm 
not interested in relations of color or form. . . . I'm not an abstractionist." 42 
He explained that color was important to him as a vehicle to express 
". . .basic human emotions — tragedy, ecstasy, doom. . . .The people who 
weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when 
I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color 
relationships, then you miss the point. " 43 Rothko had always sought to 
convey these basic emotions — but he had formerly done so through expres- 
58 sionist figures, dream-like subway scenes and, finally, mythic and Surrealist 

imagery. But it is only in his painting of the 1950's and 1960's that he 
achieves "the simple expression of the complex thought" as he distills the 
meaning of his earlier work into color; color which is the vessel for transcen- 
dental meaning. 

Red fascinates Rothko above all colors as a carrier of emotion. No other 
colot appears so insistently in his oeuvre from the time of the multiforms. It 
dominates Rothko's work of the fifties and sixies and, in fact, was the color of 
his last painting. Red is so potent optically that it overwhelms or obliterates 
other hues unless it is diluted or controlled by juxtaposing it, as Mondrian 
did, with equally strong colots, such as black and white of the other 
primaries, yellow and blue. But Rothko frequently uses it alone, altering its 
tonality according to the emotion he wishes to express. Perhaps Rothko was 
so drawn to red because of its powerful and basic associations: it is identified 
with the elements and ritual — with fire and with blood — and thus with life, 
death and the spirit. The Existentialist philosopher, Kierkegaard, whom 
Rothko and his friends deeply admired, wrote movingly of red, in terms that 
call to mind Rothko's painting: 

The result of my life is simply nothing, a mood, a single color. My result is 
like the painting of the artist who was to paint a picture of the Israelites 
crossing the Red Sea. To this end, he painted the whole wall red, 
explaining that the Israelites had already crossed over, and that the 
Egyptians were drowned. 44 

Rothko belongs very much in the tradition of such metaphysicians of 
painting as Mondrian, Paul Klee and Vasily Kandinsky, for whom color was 
the key to the realm of the spirit. The paintings and writings of Mondrian 
and Kandinsky, particularly the latter's On the Spiritual in Art , received much 
attention in New York in the 1940's. However, Rothko's commitment to 
the expression of the spiritual rather than the physical was inspired not by 
their aesthetic theories, but by the evidence of their painting. Moteover, 
magic and mysticism, myth and ritual were integral to late nineteenth- and 
twentieth- century art movements as diverse as Symbolism, Surrealism, 
Cubism and Suprematism. And Rothko's own youthful religious 
background must surely have fostered and supported his concern with the 
spiritual aspects of art. 



It is important to reiterate that Rothko did not consider himself, even 
in his mature phase, an abstract artist. He said: "I do not believe that there 
was ever a question of being abstract or representational. It is really a matter 
of ending this silence and solitude, of breathing and stretching one's arms 
again." 45 For Rothko abstract form and pure color had significance only 
insofar as they represented a higher truth. Thus, he rejected as far too 
limiting the restricted goals of pure geometric abstraction just as he re- 
nounced the literary content of Surrealism. 

Though Rothko limited his forms and restricted his number of colors, 
his intention was to enhance rather than reduce the expressive possibilities of 
his painting. To suggest multiple levels of meaning he had first to strip away 
extraneous detail, just as the Surrealist poets and painters divested the object 
of conventional associations. Once this purification has taken place and 
imagery has been renovated, the viewer is permitted new kinds of associa- 
tions, in Apollinaire's words, "numerous interpretations that sometimes 
contradict each other." 46 In these often contradictory layers of interpreta- 59 

tion, Rothko expresses rich content. Formal reductivism thus gave rise to 
expanded meaning for Rothko as for other artists of his generation. 

In a painful, often tortuous process of transformation, Rothko purified 
his painting by purging it of many of the European models he admired and 
learned from. He now expressed the metaphysical meaning of his Surrealist 
works without any recourse to the forms, symbols or allusions of his earlier 
canvases. References to the external world are subsumed into disembodied 
color, as Rothko attains a synthesis of the physical and spiritual. In this 
respect, it is interesting to note Rothko's admiration for the Italian Primi- 
tives, in particular Fra Angelico, who represented the beauty of both 
spiritual and physical worlds in their religious paintings. That Rothko was 
able to achieve this synthesis with the rigorously limited means he allowed 
himself is all the more remarkable. In these pure, reduced, transcendent 
works, Rothko makes the concrete sublime.

.LVothko banishes entirely any hint of representational imagery from his 
painting and resolves his mature, fully integrated style by 1950. He has 
arrived at his characteristic formulation: two or three horizontal, relentlessly 
frontal rectangles of disembodied color stacked one above another almost fill 
the canvas field in which they seem to hover or float. The support is either 
long and narrow, as in Green and Red on Orange, 1950 (cat. no. 93), or 
near-square, as in No. 8, 1952 (cat. no. 105). Gone are the few vestiges of 
linear elements that remained in the paintings of 1949. Gone, too, are the 
layers of color bands and contrasting horizontal and vertical forms that had 
marked the multiforms. 

Spatial illusionism always played a part in Rothko's work — from the 
Renaissance windows of his first paintings to his Surrealist dream-landscapes 
and, finally, to the Mondrian-inspired complex spatial play of the mul- 
tiforms. But this illusionism was extremely limited as early as the subway 
paintings. In a work like Subway Scene, 1938 (cat. no. 22), for example, 
although recession into depth is indicated, one tends to read the image from 
top to bottom, on the flat canvas surface. Rothko always creates a figure- 
ground relationship but, in virtually all his work from the time of the subway 
paintings, he modifies it by dividing his canvas into horizontal bands. These 
bands emphasize the canvas surface and therefore flatten the composition. 
This sectioning is an underlying, if often subliminal, unifying factor 
throughout Rothko's oeuvre. 

By 1950, this stratification is stressed further. Because Rothko's rec- 
tangles of color are utterly frontal, spatial illusionism is even more limited 
than before. But the paintings are not resolutely flat: Rothko has diminished 
the figure-ground relationship but has not abandoned it, and his forms float 
ever so slightly above the color field upon which they are placed. This depth 
is restricted, not only by means of frontality, but through feathery paint 
application which renders the rectangles almost transparent: the ground is 
revealed through the color forms and appears to merge with them. In 
addition, Rothko often uses a band or accent of stronger color to reassert the 
picture plane. Despite the emphasis on the picture plane and the sense of 
shallow depth, there is in these paintings a curious, paradoxical fluctuation 
in space — the color forms seem not only to hover on the canvas surface but 
actually to move forward. Because these veils of color are so weightless, 
because there is about them a sensation of mist and atmosphere, they advance 
and appear to exist somewhere between us and the picture, somewhere 



between what we know to be true and what we perceive. 

In these paintings, which are the essence of simplicity, Rothko express- 
es his ideas with increased clarity and directness. As he had said somewhat 
earlier: 

The progression of a painter's work, as it travels in time from point to point, 
will be toward clarity: toward the elimination of all obstacles between the 
painter and the idea and between the idea and the observer. As examples of 
such obstacles, I give (among others) memory, history or geometry, which 
are swamps of generalization from which one might pull out parodies of 
ideas (which are ghosts) but never an idea in itself. To achieve this clarity 
is, inevitably, to be understood. 47 

Rothko's commitment to reduction and clarity filled him with self- 
doubt and was achieved at great emotional cost. But this commitment 
endows his paintings with a nobility and monumentality which place him "* 

among the foremost artists of his generation, perhaps even among the greatest 
of the twentieth century and thus enables him to attain his grand ambition. He 
later came to question his single-minded direction and often told his friends 
that he felt trapped in it; he nevertheless produced an astonishing body of work 
which, especially from 1950 to 1956, was at once remarkably consistent and 
extraordinarily varied. For, while he severely limits the general format of his 
compositions, rigorously restricting the number, kind and orientation of his 
shapes, he uses canvases of different sizes and an enormous range of colors, 
combining them in seemingly infinite ways, and exquisitely adjusts the 
relationships of rectangles whose proportions are slightly altered from painting 
to painting. Through this rich and subtle formal variety, Rothko gives 
expression to an unpatalleled range of emotions, moods and sensations, a range 
and a sensibility that neither his contemporaries nor the younger generation of 
color-field painters of the later 1950's and early 1960's were able to approach. 

In these paintings, Rothko is clearly creating a set of rules for himself, 
but he would not Or could not remain within them. Constantly exploring, 
reshaping and re-evaluating form and color, he seems to have established 
these principles only to break them. Reinhardt shares with Rothko the sense 
of need for perfection, the desire to express a Utopian order, a metaphysical 
truth with his abstract form and color. And, like Rothko, he reduces his 
painting to its essence. But Reinhardt adheres obsessively to the series of 
aesthetic principles he formulated for himself. By I960 he had established a 
fixed module of a five-by-five-foot canvas and limited his color to black, his 
imagery to a cruciform structure of nine squares. The color painters of the 
sixties, too, felt the need to remain within a system. They, however, dispense 
with metaphysics in favor of the pragmatism of pure color*painting. 

Rothko perfected a technique of dyeing (or staining, as it later came to 
be called) with his paint which enabled him to satutate the threads of his 
canvas with his medium so that pigment and canvas become one. By 
applying many thin washes of paint, one over another, and often allowing 
some of the colors in the bottom layers to appear through the top coat of 
pigment, Rothko achieves the effect of a hidden light source. In most of the 
paintings of this period, Rothko creates a quality of inner light which seems 
to emanate from the very core of the work, a quality that calls to mind the 
palpable and spiritual light of Rembrandt, an artist whom he very much 
admired. Rothko often enhances this effect of inner light by floating a thin 



seam or sliver of another color through his rectangles or around their edges. 
Thus, in Green, White, Yellow on Yellow of 1951 (cat. no. 102), fleeting 
glimpses of pink underpainting punctuate the large green upper mass, which 
is partially surrounded by a narrow border of softly brushed white. There is a 
layer of green underpainting in the yellow block at the bottom of the canvas: 
it shines through the yellow, emphasizing the sense of suffused light and also 
balancing the composition. The yellow field behind the two rectangles 
provides yet another border of light and further unifies the painting. 

Rothko's mastery of both coloristic and formal nuance is revealed in 
painting after painting of the 1950's. A comparison of Brown, Blue, Brown on 
Blue, 1953, and Homage to Matisse, 1954 (cat. nos. 108, 107), demonstrates 
his supreme ability to achieve astonishingly different results within his 
severely restricted format. The former painting, roughly square in shape, is 
illuminated by an electric blue in its midsection. So powerful is this blue that 
it must be offset by two darker and larger brown forms to prevent it from 
62 destroying the stability and balance Rothko seeks. Because the blue is more 

intense in value than the other colors, it would burst out of the rectangle if 
the heavier and denser masses of brown above and below it did not press in 
upon it to hold it in place. The blue field which surrounds the three bands 
(and is also behind them) locks them together in a single plane. Contradic- 
tions between foreground and background, flatness and shallow depth 
emerge and coexist in tenuous and ever-shifting relationships. This canvas 
indicates that Rothko could exploit blue to powerful effect, yet it is a color he 
worked with less often than red — perhaps because it had come to be identified 
with Newman, who had used it so early and so well. The richness of Brown, 
Blue, Brown on Blue certainly derives in large part from Rothko's successful use 
of the several blues disposed throughout it, but also depends upon the variety 
and textures of the surrounding browns. Extraordinary balance, a superb 
handling of scale and proportion and the tension between emphatic frontality 
and flatness and an effect of shallow space also contribute to the painting's 
majesty. 

Despite the large size of Brown, Blue, Brown on Blue and the other 
paintings of this period, Rothko's work is refined and subtle and thus remains, 
despite its majestic proportions, intimate and emotionally accessible. As 
Rothko said: 

/ paint very large pictures. I realize that historically the function of 
painting large pictures is painting something very grandiose and pompous . 
The reason I paint them, however — / think it applies to other painters I 
know — is precisely because I want to be very intimate and human. To 
paint a small picture is to place yourself outside your experience, to look 
upon an experience as a stereopticon view or with a reducing glass .... 
However you paint the larger picture, you are in it. It isn't something you 
command. 48 

A special, intensely personal relationship is achieved between the viewer and 
the canvas and, by extension, Rothko. Acutely aware of the need for this 
relationship, the artist noted: 

A picture lives by companionship , expanding and quickening in the eyes of 
the sensitive observer. It dies by the same token. It is therefore a risky act to 
send it out into the world. How often it must be impaired by the eyes of the 



unfeeling and the cruelty of the impotent who would extend their affliction 
universally!^ 



The words that describe the qualities and components of Rothko's 
art — measure, balance, shape, texture, tonality — cannot adequately express 
its breathtaking beauty. Indeed, Brown, Blue, Brown on Blue and other 
mature paintings elicit a sense of awe on the part of the viewer and convey a 
feeling of mystery, a harmony and meaning that is magical and larger than 
the sum of the parts of each canvas. In these transcendent works, Rothko 
creates the contemporary spiritual equivalent of the great Renaissance paint- 
ings he revered, paintings which were meant to inspire the beholder, not 
merely with their formal perfection but also as reminders of an order beyond 
man and nature. 

The ultimate effect of Homage to Matisse is completely unlike that of 
Brown, Blue, Brown on Blue. This difference is in part produced by Rothko's 
use of a long narrow canvas, the one alternative he allows himself to the 
squarish format of Brown, Blue, Brown on Blue. Once again he employs blue, 
here in the form of a rectangle at the bottom of the composition. It is 
surmounted by a floating, vaporous yellow square. The misty yellow and the 
red beneath it behave in an unexpected way. The red that peers through from 
underneath the yellow overlay has a bluish tinge. This is curious, because 
when red and yellow interact they normally produce orange. To create this 
unusual effect, Rothko must have made the square an extremely bluish-red. 
But the uncovered portion of it is a true red: in all probability Rothko 
overpainted the band with this color. Therefore, in a quite inexplicable way, 
the veiled red, which should be more orange than the uncovered band, is 
actually bluish. The result is a sense of coherent shape and implausible color. 
Rothko refuses to accept proven rules about the behavior of color — that is, 
that red and yellow make orange. Here he creates his own rules and reinvents

color, and this is his homage to Matisse. 

Matisse was profoundly important to Rothko and his contemporaries. 
His The Red Studio. 1911 (fig. 46), and The Blue Window, autumn 1911. 
without doubt inspired the artists of the New York School. To be sure, 
Rothko did not find relevant Matisse's rather straightforward representation 
of objects in such paintings. But his radical use of unifying planes of sensuous 
color which flatten space into the two-dimensional surface of the canvas had 
enormous impact on Rothko. 

There is also a symbolic and spiritual dimension in Homage to Matisse. In 
his choice of scarlet and true red, Rothko perhaps makes reference to Catholic 
vestments. The dense blue rectangle is emphatically, intensely physical; it 
contrasts with and acts as a foil for the evanescent, incorporeal form of the 
golden square. This shimmering halo-like form calls forth associations with 
religious imagery. Thus, the painting speaks of form and space, of the real and 
immaterial, the physical and sensual yet disembodied presence of paint. 

During the course of the 1950's , Rothko experiments in a number of ■ 
ways: the size of the field and the interior configuration differ in relationship 
to one another and from painting to painting, the widths of the spaces 
between colors vary, colors range from bright to dark, from gay to sober, but 
are rarely somber, small amounts of black are introduced, although this color 
does not figure prominently until the late 1960's. Paint is handled in a loose, 
brushy manner, feathered out so that the edges of forms are never clearly 
defined. The canvas is stretched and then painted not only on its front surface 
but on its sides as well. The works are left unframed so that the depth of the 
stretchers and the entire painted surface are revealed. Although his composi- 
tions are generally weighted towards their tops, Rothko occasionally concen- 
trates his darkest, heaviest colors at the bottom of the canvas, as, for 
example, in Light. Earth and Blue , 1954 (cat. no. 116). Light, Earth and Blue 
is one of the few paintings of this time with a title that enhances its meaning. 
Rothko had no fixed system for naming his canvases: most are either left 
untitled or identified with numbers or colors, since he probably felt that 
more interpretive or descriptive names would restrict their meanings. Some- 
times he bleeds the edges of rectangles so they appear unfinished — he then 
completes their forms by enclosing them within another color area, as in 
Number 8, 1952 (cat. no. 105), or he leaves part of the rectangle so well 
defined that the viewer can read it as a totality and complete the shape 
himself, as in Yellow. Orange. Red on Orange , 1954 (cat. no. 1 10). 

Rothko minimizes the tactility of his paint by dyeing it into the canvas; 
as we have seen, his color, despite its intensity, becomes disembodied and 
seems to hover somewhere in front of the paintings. Because by now the 
canvases are larger than life-size — and are often very large indeed — the 
spectator is encompassed by these floating color shapes, drawn into space 
that exists somewhere between himself and the picture plane and is engulfed 
in an overwhelming emotional experience. Rothko's commitment to creat- 
ing this exalted emotional experience, to art as an act of revelation, shared by 
Still and Newman, contrasts markedly with the attitudes of painters like 
Pollock or de Kooning and Franz Kline, for whom the physical rather than 
the spiritual aspects of painting were of central importance. For these artists 
who emphasized the gestural elements of Abstract Expressionism, the canvas 
must reflect the very act of painting. Pollock, pouring paint, walking around 
and in his canvas, using his entire body as he worked, was the quintessential 
action painter. Because his canvases were so large, Rothko probably had to 



expend as much physical energy when he painted as Pollock did. But 
Rothko's approach was contemplative rather than physical; unlike Pollock, 
who worked intuitively, rapidly and spontaneously, Rothko proceeded from 
long periods of meditation to the physical act of painting. 

As the 1950's advance, Rothko's canvases grow larger, the edges of his 
forms become more concrete, the colors more opaque, the mood of the work 
more somber. This shift in direction was clarified and emphatically reflected 
in a mural series Rothko executed for the Four Seasons restaurant in the 
Seagram Building in 1958. Rothko had never before received a mural 
commission nor had he ever painted a formal and unified series. He worked 
on them for nearly a year and actually completed three separate sets of murals 
before he was satisfied. Each set became progressively darker: the first were 
primarily orange and brown, the last, deepest maroon and black. In them, 
Rothko abandons solid color-forms in favor of rectangles with open centers 
that reveal the field behind them and therefore suggest doorways. For the first 
time he employs a horizontal support with a vertical configuration and restricts 65 

his palette more severely than ever before, using only two colors in each panel. 
Rothko explained that the panels were inspired by Michelangelo: 

After I had been at work for some time, I realized that I was much 
influenced subconsciously by Michelangelo's walls in the staircase room of 
the Medicean Library in Florence . . . he makes the viewers feel that they 
are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up, so 
that all they can do is butt their heads forever against the wall. 50 

For the first time, the work is brooding, forbidding, tragic. 

Rothko completed the commission but did not deliver the paintings: 
when he saw the space for which they were intended, he said he was offended 
and returned the sum he had been paid for them. In fact, this was not the only 
time Rothko refused to sell his work or accept patronage. He would not allow 
certain museums to buy his paintings in the 1950's and returned the 
Guggenheim International Award prize money he won in 1958. These 
actions no doubt depended upon deep-seated emotional and moral attitudes. 
By this time famous and financially secure, he must still have been outraged 
by social injustice, as he had been in his impoverished youth. The radical, 
liberal Jewish immigrant probably felt guilty because he was himself rich 
and had accepted a commission for a commercial establishment that served 
the wealthy. It is well known that Rothko's success brought him at least as 
much torment as comfort. Whether or not Rothko was ever really satisfied 
with the Four Seasons murals is open to conjecture. He did consent to sell the 
first group as separate paintings. The second set was abandoned and the third, 
completed in 1959, Rothko gave to The Tate Gallery in London (figs. 47, 48). 

In I960, The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., openedanew 
wing and set aside a room in it to display their three Rothkos, which 
included Green and Tangerine on Red, 1956 (cat. no. 13 1). A fourth painting, 
Ochre and Red on Red, 1954 (cat. no. 1 18), was acquired in 1964 and added to 
the room at that time. The idea was conceived by Duncan Phillips, who was 
moved by the artist's profound use of light and color. The windows in the 
room were darkened, and thus was born the first "Rothko Chapel." This 
installation undoubtedly affected Rothko's thinking about future presenta- 
tions of his work. 

Rothko was given his first important one-man museum exhibition by 



66

■k 






The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1961. He directed the 
installation himself and made radical decisions about lighting and place- 
ment. When he participated in the 15 Americans show at The Museum of 
Modern Art in 1952, Rothko had asked that his paintings be hung in blazing 
light and placed so close together that they touched one another. Some time 
later, however, when one of his canvases was installed in the Modern's 
collection galleries, Rothko indicated that he wanted the lighting dimmed. 
Now he had all of the works hung very close to one another and drastically 
reduced the lighting, so that the paintings appeared to glow in the dark. The 
effect produced was one of an intimate environment, of a dark space in which 
the paintings, instead of existing as individual entities, constituted a series 
although they ranged in date from 1945 to I960 and varied considerably in 
style. 



Rothko was commissioned to execute a series of murals in 1961 for 
Harvard University by Professor Wassily Leontief, Chairman of the Society 
of Fellows and Professor of Economics of Harvard University, and John P. 
Coolidge, Director of the Fogg Art Museum. They were slated to be installed 
in the penthouse of Holyoke Center, designed by Jose Luis Sert, but were 
ultimately placed on permanent view in the faculty dining room at the 
Center. Completed in 1962, the Harvard murals were exhibited at the 
Guggenheim Museum in the late spring of 1963 before they were sent on to 
Cambridge. The series consisted of five monumental panels which were 
intended to be hung in two distinct but interrelated groups (cat. nos. 
175-177). For the Guggenheim installation, Rothko flanked a wide panel 
with two narrower ones; these formed a triptych. The remaining panels, one 
wide, one narrow, were hung on separate walls adjoining the triptych. 

Rothko's configurations in these murals are made up of post and lintel 
forms — single ones in the narrower panels, double ones merged together in 
the wide ones. The plinth-like masses are linked at top and bottom by very 67 

narrow bands and by small discrete rectangles. The ground is dusky plum- 
purple, one of Rothko's favorite colors, which is offset by black, deep alizarin 
and creamy yellow columns. The relationship of the pillars to the picture 
plane creates the illusion of space, while the saturated pigment and 
brushwork assert the two-dimensionality of the canvas surface. The murals, 
more impetuously painted than his earlier canvases, are replete with tempes- 
tuous strokes and aggressive blocky forms. The somber colors and massive 
shapes create at once a sense of architecture, silence and stasis. The cumula- 
tive effect of the installation at the Guggenheim was a feeling of a sanctuary 
within a public space. 

The Museum of Modern Art installation may have influenced an in- 
creasing bias on Rothko's part in favor of dimly lit presentations and the 
evolution of ever-darker paintings throughout the sixties. This development 
must also be attributed to a change in Rothko's personality, for as his fame 
grew, so did his uneasiness, and he became increasingly depressed as the 
years passed. Internal and external pressures mounted. The strain of The 
Museum of Modern Art exhibition took its toll — he produced very little in 
1962 and 1963- He attended more and more ceremonial events — such as the 
Kennedy and Johnson inaugural festivities and a state dinner celebrating the 
arts at the White House — and painted less and less. Although highly 
acclaimed in the fifties, he was barely earning enough then to support his 
wife, Mell, and his daughter, Kate, born in 1950. Now he was able to travel 
abroad extensively with his family and visit the cities and monuments he 
must have yearned to see. In 1963, his son, Christopher, was born. He 
should have been happy and confident but he was deeply troubled. Friends 
relate that he spoke of being trapped and feared his work had reached a dead 
end. 

But by 1964, Rothko was preoccupied with a major undertaking, a 
commission from Dominique and John de Menil to execute murals for a 
chapel in Houston (figs. 49, 50). This chapel, originally intended to be 
Roman Catholic and part of the University of St. Thomas, was finally 
realized as an interdenominational chapel affiliated with the Institute of 
Religion and Human Development at Rice University. The octagonal floor 
plan was designed by Philip Johnson; the final design was executed under the 
supervision of Howard Barnstone and Eugene Aubrey. Rothko accepted the 
project with great enthusiasm and began to work on the murals shortly after 



68 



he moved into his last studio, a converted carriage house on East 69th Street. 
The commission gave Rothko the opportunity to fulfill one of his life's 
ambitions — to create a monument that could stand in the great tradition of 
Western religious art. He placed a parachute over his skylight to adjust the 
natural light that filtered in during the daytime, preferring to keep the 
studio relatively dark. Rothko became obsessed with the chapel. He started 
the panels in the winter of 1964 and continued to work intensively on them 
until 1967, when they were basically complete. Yet even after 1967 he 
returned to them from time to time to make minor changes. 

Tragically, Rothko did not live to see this project realized, and it was 
dedicated almost one year to the day after he committed suicide. Rothko 
designed three triptychs, five single panels and four alternatives for the 
chapel (figs. 49, 50). His theme was the Passion of Christ and he had, at one 
point, planned to place the numbers of the fourteen Stations of the Cross on 
the exterior of the building to indicate the location of each panel inside the 
structure. Two triptychs and one single panel are comprised of black hard- 
edged rectangles on maroon fields; one triptych and four single panels are 
entirely black, veiled with a wash of maroon. Variations in the thickness of 
paint produce nuances of color. In these murals on the Passion of Christ, 
Rothko evokes with his red and black his belief in the passion of life, the 
finality of death, the reality of the spirit. Red, so often the principal carrier of 
Rothko's emotions and ideas, is now accompanied by black, which sym- 
bolizes his state of mind and the character of his existence in the latter part of 
his life. Black, however, does not signify only death. It is one of the richest 
colors in the artist's palette. Rothko had reduced his painting in the fifties by 
restricting it to the simplest shapes and to color; now he was purifying it even 
of colors, limiting himself to red and, finally, black. These reds and blacks 
do not any longer seem to exist as physical color, but rather, as tranquil, 
tragic, twilit dreams of color. Even more than the Four Seasons or Harvard 
murals, the Houston paintings create a total environment, a unified atmo- 
sphere of all-encompassing, awe-inspiring spirituality. 

In 1968, Rothko suffered an aneurysm of the aorta. This condition was 
aggravated by other ailments, by heavy drinking — common among artists 
of his generation — and by family problems. Nevertheless, in the last two 
years of his life Rothko produced an astonishing and prolific body of work. 
These were in acrylics, a medium which Rothko chose because he was 
attracted to their fast-drying qualities — he was able to make one painting a 
day. Some were canvases but the majority were extraordinary paper pieces, 
among the most exquisite work he had done. He had, of course, worked on 
paper in the forties and he executed small-scale paper versions of his oils on 
canvas in 1958. Rothko had his assistant roll out a length of paper on the 
floor as he watched. Once he decided on the size he wanted, he had a series of 
ten to fifteen sheets cut to approximately the same dimensions. Then he 
tacked the papers on the wall in a row and worked on them one at a time. 

The new acrylics are simplicity itself: in most of them two dark 
planes — either brown or black on grey — are surrounded by a narrow white 
border. The borders were of extreme importance to Rothko, who constantly 
readjusted their proportions in relation to the inner configurations. Imagery, 
mood and meaning are vastly different from his work of the 1950's and early 
1960's. The glowing colors of the earlier paintings are replaced here by 
deeper, quieter hues; the rectangles, which formerly floated, are denser, 
more stable, because of the more opaque quality of the acrylics. Rothko's

preference for horizontal divisions within vertical canvases and configura- 
tions is replaced by an insistence upon horizontal divisions of horizontal 
supports. Where the vertical called to mind architecture, the horizontal 
alludes to landscape. The doorways to a higher reality created before the 
Houston Chapel were still redolent with sensuous color and form: there was 
in them an equilibrium between two states of existence, the spiritual and the 
physical. The new works, however, speak entirely of another, transcendent 
world, of a painter who has crossed a threshold into the far side of reality. 

These landscapes of the spirit bear a certain resemblance to paintings by 
Caspar David Friedrich, such as Monk by the Sea (fig. 51). Both artists stand in 
awe of the spirit, both use nature to express that spirit. Friedrich, of course, 
felt it necessary to incorporate a human element in the figure of the monk; 
Rothko has long since banished all allusions to the human form. Specific 
references to beach, sea and sky are also unnecessary for Rothko. He conveys 
all of his meaning through gesture and in the way the darker, heavier top 
mass meets the lighter, usually smaller area of grey below. The two planes are 
painstakingly adjusted and readjusted; between them is a band which 
appears to be a flicker of light. Often, especially in the paper pieces, this 
luminosity is Inness-like. The weight and texture of the canvas create a 
heavier, darker presence than the paper does. In both paper pieces and 
canvases, however, Rothko is moving towards darkness, "...the abstract 
idea is incarnated in the image. . . . But this is not to say that the images 
created by Rothko are the thin evocations of the speculative intellect; they are 
rather the concrete, the tactual expression of the intuitions of an artist to 
whom the subconscious represents not the farther, but the nearer shore of 
art," wrote the author of the preface to the catalogue of Rothko's one-man 
exhibition at Art of This Century in 1945. By the end of his life Rothko had 
moved beyond such concepts in his painting. No longer is his art earthbound, 
sensual, corporeal. He had attained a harmony, an equilibrium, a wholeness, 
in the Jungian sense, that enabled him to express universal truths in his 
breakthrough works, fusing the conscious and the unconscious, the finite and 
the infinite, the equivocal and the unequivocal, the sensuous and the spiritual. 
Now he had left behind all that spoke of the carnate, the concrete. He had 
reached the farther shore of art.

Rothko and Gottlieb discuss their aesthetic 
principles and theories on WNYC radio broad- 
cast. Assert their intetest in Jungian and eternal 
symbols, belief in power of myth, importance of 
archaism and of psychological content. 

Our presentation oj these myths , however, must 
he in our own terms, which are at once more 
primitive and more modern than the myths 
themselves— more primitive because we seek the 
primeval and atavistic roots of the idea rather 
than their graceful classical version; more 
modern than the myths themselves because we 
must redescribe their implications through our 
own experience.

Robert M. Coates reviewing Hofmann show at 
Mortimer Brandt Gallery, New York, in The 
New Yorker, uses term "abstract expressionism" 
in discussing New York artists: ". . .he is cer- 
tainly one of the most uncompromising rep- 
resentatives of what some people call the 
spatter-and-daub school of painting and I, more 
politely, have christened abstract Expres- 
sionism." Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had employed 
same term in relation to Kandinsky in 1936 in 
his book Cubism and Abstract Art.

With Baziotes, David Hare and Motherwell, 
founds school. The Sublets of the Artist, at 35 
East 8th Street. Name is Newman's suggestion; 
he |oins faculty second semester. Still partici- 
pates in initial planning stages but does not 
teach, as he returns to position at California 
School of Fine Arts. There are no formal courses 
but a "spontaneous investigation into the sub- 
jects of the modern artist — what his subjects 
are, how they are arrived at, methods of inspira- 
tion and transformation, moral attitudes, pos- 
sibilities for further explorations.. . ." (An- 
nouncement for School, The Subjects of the Artist, 
New York, 1948-49) Approximately fifteen 
students attend school.

to public Some of speakers are Jean Arp, John

school started on premises of The Subjects of the 
Artist after it dissolves, and The Club, informal 
Abstract Expressionist group, grow out of this 
series. 

In letter to Still, Rothko states that Newman 
proposes to carry on public relations, arrange 
lectures and seminars for The Subjects of the 
Artist. In later letter to Still, writes of being on 
eve of nervous breakdown, says he is withdraw- 
ing from participation in school. (San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art, Cly fford Still. January 
9-March 14, 1976, p. 113) 

Configurations are simplified, reduced in 
number, colors intensified, canvases increase in

Writes to Lloyd Goodrich, Associate Director of

regarding the acquisition and display of his

Since I have a deep sense of responsibility for 
the life my pictures will lead out in the world, 
I will with gratitude accept any form of their 
exposition where their life and meaning can be 
maintained, and avoid all occasions where 1 
feel that this cannot be done. . . .at least in my 
life, I must maintain a congruity between my 
actions and convictions, if I am to continue to 
function and do my work. And I do hope that I 
have here clarified my position .

sity of Colorado, Boulder. 



"The Wild Ones," Time, includes discussion of 
Baziotes, Gorky, Gottlieb, Guston, de Koon- 
ing, Motherwell, Pollock and Rothko: 

A cursory study of advance-guard painting 
gives rise to the conclusion that it consists, like 
the Mock Turtle's arithmetic of "Ambition, 
Distraction, Uglifi cation and Derision." It 
is wild, woolly , willful. But nothing has only 
one side, and negatives cannot sum up Ameri- 
ca's newest painting. A good deal can be said 
for its positive qualities , once they have been set 
in the context of modern history. . . . 

Pollock dies in car accident.

In Letter to the Editor ot Art News, Rothko 
refutes Elaine de Kooning's article, "Two 
Americans in Action," Art News Annua/, 1958, 
which labels both Rothko and Kline as "action 
painters" 

/ reject that aspect of the article which clas- 
sifies my work as "Action Painting." An 
artist herself, the author must know that to 
classify is to embalm. Real identity is incom- 
patible with schools and categories, except by 
mutilation. To allude to my work as Action 
Painting borders on the fantastic . No matter 
what modifications and adjustments are made 
to the meaning of the word action. Action 
Painting is antithetical to the very look and 
spirit of my work. The work must be the final 
arbiter.

Receives Honorary Degree, Doctor of Fine Arts,

As one of the few artists who can be counted 
among the founders of a new school of Ameri- 
can painting, you have made an enduring 
place for yourself in the art of this cen- 
tury. Your paintings are marked by a simplic- 
ity of form and a magnificence of color. In 
them you have attained a visual and spiritual 
grandeur whose foundation is the tragic vein 
in an human existence. In admiration of your 
influence, which has nourished young artists 
throughout the world, Yale confers upon you 
the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts. (Reprinted 
in Yale University Art Gallery, New Ha- 
ven, Salute to Mark Rothko, May 6-June 
20, 1971.) 

Donates Seagram murals to The Tate Gallery, 
London. Rothko stipulates that the nine can- 
vases are to be placed in a room by themselves 
and are never to be shown with other paintings. 
"It seems to me that the heart of the matter is 
now to give this space you propose the greatest 
eloquence and poignancy of which my pictures 
are capable." (Quoted in Alastair Gordon, "In 
the Galleries: The Rothko Room," The Connois- 
seur, vol. 175, no. 706, December 1970, p. 
303.)
