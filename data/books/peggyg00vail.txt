Sponsor's Statement 



Peggy Guggenheim: A Celebration pays homage to the lifework 
of a unique woman. Like her uncle Solomon R. Guggenheim, 
whose initiative created the museum in New York, Peggy — with 
her uncompromising passion for art — laid a cornerstone for the 
international scope of the Guggenheim today. 

When, in 1995, Hugo Boss and the Guggenheim Museum 
decided to enter into a partnership, a new model of sponsorship 
was born — a creative collaboration whose driving force is 
the continuous exchange of ideas and thoughts transcending 
borders. 

Just as Peggy Guggenheim championed contemporary art, 
we have made it our goal to recognize and promote innovation 
in the arts by teaming up with the Guggenheim Museum in 
New York to establish the Hugo Boss Prize, a biennial award to 
an artist whose work represents a major aesthetic achievement 
or significant development in contemporary art. In this way, we 
feel connected to her spirit. 

Peggy Guggenheim was more than a collector of contempo- 
rary art. She was a patron with esprit and unmistakable 
style. This book is illustrated with artworks from the renowned 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection and photographs that document 
her life. Also shown is a selection of pages from Peggy's guest 
books; the signatures and drawings on these pages are a 
remarkable record of the international art community that 
visited her during her years in Venice. 

Published on the occasion of an exhibition with which 
we are proud to have been associated, Peggy Guggenheim: 
A Celebration offers a rare and inspiring experience. 

HUGO BOSS 



Foreword 



Peggj Guggenheim was among the most important and original 
figures to play a role in the ari of this century. The centennial 
of her birth provides the perfect occasion to consider her endur- 
ing influence on the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, an 
entity that was founded independently but came to encompass 
her lasting heritage, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. 

For me, as for its many visitors, the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection is an indelible aspect of the Venice experience. Peggy 
settled in this fabled city in the last part of an eventful and 
fascinating life. And. although she had lived with a stubborn 
independence, it was to the organization founded by her uncle, 
another towering, but altogether different, art patron, that she 
bequeathed her legacy— the extraordinary collection of Modern 
painting and sculpture she assembled and the palazzo on 
Venice's Grand Canal that houses it. 

The Guggenheim Foundation was founded in 1937 to realize 
four basic objectives: the collection, preservation, interpretation. 
and presentation of objects of twentieth-century visual culture. 
The Peggy Guggenheim Collection was the first European 
venue for the Guggenheim, and the inspiration for the vision 
that has led to our more recent multinational expansion. With 
the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Deutsche Guggenheim 
Berlin, both of which opened to the public in the fall of 1997. the 
Guggenheim has solidified its international presence. 

My predecessor as director of the Guggenheim, Thomas M. 
Messer, played a pivotal role in bringing the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection into the Guggenheim Foundation. Though this 
event may seem, from our vantage, to have been preordained. 
m fact it was anything but. (For a chronicle of the complex 
story behind the bequest, see "The History of a Courtship" in 
this volume.) Under Tom's direction, the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection and the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni were fully profession- 
alized, through physical improvements and the development 
of a dedicated museum staff: in time, a program of temporary 
exhibitions was introduced to complement the permanent collec- 
tion. In L993, the palazzo and its garden were renovated and the 
museum enlarged to include a neighboring two-story building. 

While special exhibitions have given the institution an 
added luster, it is Peggy's collection that continues to Berve a- 



the institution's greatest draw, luring some 250,000 visitors 
annually. The collection, however, has been augmented 
through extended loans of Modern and contemporary sculpture 
from the Patsy R. and Raymond D. Nasher Collection, and 
early twentieth-century Italian art from the Gianni Mattioli 
Collection. With a new tradition of development and growth, the 
future of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection promises to be as 
bright as its past. 

It is that illustrious past that is so elegantly captured in 
this volume, published on the occasion of an exhibition mounted 
first at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and then at the 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The show and this book are the 
result of several years of research by Peggy's granddaughter 
Karole P. B. Vail, a Project Curatorial Assistant at the 
Guggenheim. With her access to rare pieces, she has brought 
together a range of materials that tells the story of Peggy 
Guggenheim from an original perspective. Among the treasures 
exhibited to the public for the first time are childhood portraits 
of Peggy by Franz von Lenbach and Peggy's astonishing guest 
books. In these books, which she kept in her palazzo, scores of 
major cultural figures— such as John Cage, Jean Cocteau, Marcel 
Duchamp, Clement Greenberg, and Man Ray — wrote personal 
comments and poems and, in many cases, sketched charming 
drawings as mementos of their visits. A selection of pages from 
these guest books, which are still in family hands, are published 
in this volume for the first time. 

The exhibition has been sponsored in New York by Hugo Boss, 
a long-term and valued partner of the Guggenheim Museum, and 
in Venice by Lufthansa German Airlines. The generous support 
of these two enlightened institutions continues to make possible 
so much of what the Guggenheim does.

Acknowledgments 



Peggy Guggenheim: A Centennial Celebration and its accompany- 
ing publication are dedicated to my late parents, Sindbad and 
Peggy Angela Vail. I am especially grateful to my mother, who 
initiated this project, and whose memory has been a constant 
inspiration to me. 

This exhibition is the fruit of encouragement from family, 
friends, and colleagues, whom I hope will be as pleased with the 
result as I was in realizing it. I am fortunate to have benefited 
from their good humor and support, which has truly made this 
an enjoyable and invaluable experience for me. 

At the Guggenheim, I am most grateful to my cousin Peter 
Lawson-Johnston, Chairman, for his constant support and enthu- 
siasm, and to Thomas Krens, Director, who from the beginning 
advocated this important celebration of Peggy Guggenheim in 
the year of her centennial birthday I am also deeply appreciative 
of the encouragement and advice of Lisa Dennison, Deputy 
Director and Chief Curator, Carmen Gimenez, Curator of 
Twentieth-Century Art, and Judith Cox, Deputy Director and 
General Counsel. 

I am particularly grateful for the assistance and insight of 
J. Fiona Ragheb, Assistant Curator, who spent many hours 
advising me on curatorial and editorial matters. I would also like 
to offer my appreciation to Jennifer Blessing, former Associate 
Curator, who keenly supported an exhibition on the "grande 
dame du Surrealisme." 

Many other Guggenheim Museum staff members contributed 
enormously to the success of the exhibition. I am deeply grateful 
to Jodi Myers, Assistant Registrar, who skillfully handled the 
many complexities of the exhibition with constant good will and 
humor, and to Suzanne Quigley, Head Registrar for Collections 
and Exhibitions, for her assistance and enthusiasm. I also thank 
Karen Meyerhoff, Director of Exhibition and Collection 
Management and Design, for her talent and imagination, and 
Jocelyn Groom and Sean Mooney, Exhibition Design 
Coordinators. 

I am immensely appreciative of the expertise of Gillian 
McMillan, Senior Conservator (Collections), and her talented 
team, including Eleonora Nagy, Associate Conservator for 



11 



Sculpture, and Nicole Basso, Conservation Coordinator. To 
Jocelyn Brayshaw, Chief Preparator for Paper, and to Elizabeth 
Jaff, Associate Preparator for Paper, I express my thanks for the 
superb presentation of the guest book pages and the photographs 
in the exhibition. Many thanks are also due to Alissa Warshaw, 
freelance mount maker and art handler, who beautifully 
designed the presentation of the earrings. I am very grateful to 
Peter Read, Manager of Fabrication and Design, and his crew, 
David Johnson, Chief Frame Maker, Scott Wilhelme, Cabinet 
Maker, and Stephen Engelman, Fabrication Technician. The 
organization of the installation was achieved through the contri- 
butions of Scott Wixon, Manager of Art Services and 
Preparations, Richard Gombar, Construction Manager, Anthony 
Villamena, Assistant Construction Manager, and Jonathan 
Welten and Bart Bettencourt under the supervision of Michael 
Sarff; Jeffrey Clemens, Art Handler, who oversaw the installa- 
tion; and Mary Ann Hoag, Lighting Technician, who devised the 
exhibition's subtle lighting. 

Deserving special thanks are my close neighbors on the third 
floor of the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, especially Vivien 
Greene, Curatorial Coordinator for Research and Exhibitions, 
who advised me on many matters, and Janice Yang, Project 
Research Exhibition Assistant. I would also like to thank Robert 
Rosenblum, Curator of Twentieth-Century Art, Nancy Spector, 
Curator of Contemporary Art, Matthew Drutt, Associate Curator 
for Research, Ilene Magaras, Librarian and Archivist, and partic- 
ularly Ward Jackson, former Archivist, for their helpful guidance. 

For their successful efforts to publicize the exhibition, I offer 
thanks to Scott Gutterman, Director of Public Affairs, Julia 
Caldwell, Public Affairs Coordinator, and Joyce Lee, Public 
Affairs Assistant. 

My very special thanks go to Susan Madden, Director of 
Membership, who helped me decipher countless signatures in the 
guest books, and whose unfailing support was merely one of 
many facets of her friendship. 

I am deeply indebted to David Heald, Chief Photographer 
and Director of Photographic Services, and his wonderful team, 
particularly Ellen Labenski, Assistant Photographer, for their 
photographs used for the exhibition and catalogue, and Kim 
Bush, Photography and Permissions Associate. I also thank Lee 
Ewing, former Assistant Photographer, for having photographed 
and documented the guest books.

The publication of this handsome and elegant book would 
not have been possible without the encouragement, generosity, 
and enthusiasm of Anthony Calnek, Director of Publications. 
I will be forever grateful to Edward Weisberger, Editor, for his 
meticulous and painstaking editing; Elizabeth Levy, Managing 
Editor/Manager of Foreign Editions, Esther Yun, Assistant 
Production Manager, and Melissa Secondino, Production 
Assistant, whose efforts ensured the beauty of this catalogue; 
and Carol Fitzgerald, Associate Editor, and Nicole Columbus, 
for their editorial thoroughness. I am delighted to have worked 
with Patrick Seymour and Ji Lee, Tsang Seymour Design Inc., 
New York, who designed the book with exceptional sensitivity. I 
also thank Susan Lee, Assistant Graphic Designer, who designed 
the exhibition's graphics; and Andrea Smalley, Membership 
Coordinator, and Peggy Allen, Development Assistant, who orga- 
nized the opening event. 

It has been a great honor to include in this catalogue the 
insightful essay of Thomas Messer, Director Emeritus, whose con- 
stant interest and support have been invaluable to this project. 

I express my gratitude to Ruth Taylor, Director of Budgeting 
and Planning, Peter Katz, Budget Analyst', Ben Hartley, Director 
of Communications, and George McNeely, former Director of 
Corporate and Foundation Giving. I also thank Marilyn JS 
Goodman, Director of Education, Diane Maas and Felicia Liss, 
Education Program Managers, and Adele Kandel, Volunteer 
Coordinator. 

To all the staff at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, 
and in particular Philip Rylands, Deputy Director, I extend 
my thanks for the extraordinary support, advice, and understand- 
ing that enabled so many works of art to leave their home and 
reach more tumultuous American shores. My heartfelt thanks 
also go to Fred Licht, Curator; Renata Rossani, Administrator, for 
her myriad efforts; Paul Schwartzbaum, Chief Conservator, 
Guggenheim Museums/Technical Director, International Projects, 
for his unfailing support; Chiara Barbieri, Deputy Director's 
Assistant, for her valuable efforts; and Beate Barner, Assistant 
for Development and Public Affairs. I am grateful to Claudia 
Rech, Membership and Special Events Officer; Siro de Boni, 
Maintenance; and Sandra Rossi, former Publications Assistant. 
Jane Rylands, who rescued the guest books from the rising 
Venetian tides and entrusted them to my father, Sindbad Vail, 
deserves my very special thanks.

Peggy Guggenheim 
Life and Art 



Karole P. B. Vail 



The Guggenheims 

A little girl with long locks of hair clutches her hands tightly. 
She stands in an awkward but determined way, looking out 
directly and inquisitively. Her big eyes sparkle. Her pert mouth 
quivers slightly. She dares not move lest the painter reprimand 
her. Around 1903, Franz von Lenbach, a German artist 
favored by Bavarian high society, painted my grandmother 
Peggy Guggenheim "for some strange reason" with "brown eyes 
instead of green, and red hair instead of chestnut." 1 Though 
later Peggy would not favor figurative art, she cherished this for- 
mal portrait — whose date she had erased so that people would 
not guess her age — and, even more, the portrait, also by 
Lenbach, of herself and her older sister, Benita, who with her 
beautiful brown hair and brown eyes did not need fanciful 
embellishments. As befitted a man of his position, her father, the 
dashing Benjamin Guggenheim, had commissioned these paint- 
ings, which Peggy considered "the greatest treasures of my 
past." 2 In later years, she kept them in her bedroom in Venice as 
reminders of her childhood and of those days when her father 
and sister were still alive. 

On August 26, 1898, Peggy, the second of three daughters, 
was born into two wealthy and famous New York Jewish fami- 
lies: the Guggenheims and the Seligmans. A half century before, 
in 1848 — a year of political turmoil throughout Europe — her 
paternal grandfather, Simon Guggenheim, and his son, Meyer, 
had left the ghetto of Lengnau in German Switzerland, and 
sailed for Philadelphia, dreaming of success and freedom. 
Indeed, Philadelphia and Pennsylvania were among the most 
liberal of all the cities and states of the United States, as well 
as being important political, cultural, and economic centers. 
Father and son peddled household goods door-to-door, and

Meyer, taking full advantage of his newfound freedom, began to 
manufacture stove polish, the first of many family industries— 
which would come to include speculations in foodstuffs and 
spices, and lace and embroidery manufacturing. The greatest 
wealth, however, would come from investments in mining, espe- 
cially lead and silver mines near Leadville, Colorado. 

Meyer had seven sons and three daughters with his wife, 
Barbara. She nurtured her children, placing an emphasis on cul- 
ture and particularly on the appreciation of music. Meyer disci- 
plined each son to ensure that they would work hard and stay 
together. He said that together the brothers were as strong as a 
bundle of sticks, but apart they were as weak as a single stick, 
which could be easily broken. The brothers were all partners 
in M. Guggenheim's Sons, the family-owned business. Benjamin, 
born in 1865, was Meyer's sixth child and one of the younger 
and wilder sons. Of the other brothers, Solomon would become 
the founder of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and 
of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum opened posthumously), and Simon would 
establish the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, 
famous for its grants. Benjamin was sent to Leadville to learn 
the mining business during his college summers; although he did 
not graduate, he was the first of the Guggenheims to attend an 
institution of higher learning. He became the manager of the 
Philadelphia smelter in Pueblo, Colorado. 



In 1888, Meyer and his wife moved from Philadelphia to 
New York's Upper West Side, and the sons soon followed. In 
1894, Benjamin married Florette Seligman from the very 
successful international banking family. Joseph Seligman, the 
first of his family to come to America, had left the Bavarian 
village of Baiersdorf and arrived in 1837, a decade before 
the Guggenheims left Lengnau. All of his siblings, including five 
brothers, subsequently emigrated. James Seligman, Peggy's 
maternal grandfather, established a dry-goods store in New York 
in 1846, and he and the other brothers founded the banking 
firm of J. &amp; W. Seligman in New York in 1864. The Seligmans— 
established in New York long before the Guggenheims moved 
there— were considered the more socially elite and cultivated of 
the two families. James and his wife, Rosa, had eight children, 
many of whom exhibited troubling eccentricities and ailments. 
Of Florette 's two sisters, one sang rather than spoke her conver- 
sations and the other was catatonic. Florette herself repeated 
everything she said three times: "Shush, Peggy will see, Peggy 
will see, Peggy will see." 3 Benjamin was upset that his wife's 
family considered him their social inferior, and Florette 's 
own behavior was perhaps so odd that he may have concluded 
he made a mistake when he married her. As Peggy recalled, 
"I guess she didn't attract him and other women attracted him 
more." 4 Not a good omen for a happy family. Indeed, he soon 
started having extramarital affairs, and continued to have them 
even after the births of three daughters: Benita, born in 1895; 
Peggy, who had been born Marguerite and called Maggie by her 
father; and Hazel, born in 1903. 

Although Benjamin and William, the youngest brother, were 
the smelting experts of the family, neither was consulted in 1899 
when the Guggenheim Exploration Company, known as 
Guggenex, was formed. Both brothers objected to the new corpo- 
rate entity because, unlike M. Guggenheim's Sons, it welcomed 
outside investors. By that time, Benjamin had become quarrel- 
some at family meetings and was considered to be the black 
sheep of the Guggenheim family because of his personal indis- 
cretions. Benjamin and William separated themselves from 
the family business, which subsequently became more cohesive 
in its organization. Among its widespread endeavors, Guggenex 
took control of the American Smelting and Refining Company 
and mining industries all over the world. By the beginning of 
World War I, the Guggenheims and their associates reportedly 
controlled between seventy-five and eighty percent of the world's 



19 



silver, copper, and lead mines. Benjamin was to miss out on the 
grandest era of Guggenheim business expansion, and Florette 
and their daughters were to suffer the financial consequences. 

After 1900, Benjamin dabbled in business enterprises in 
Paris and New York, but the earnings from his largely unsuc- 
cessful ventures paled beside the vast riches he would have 
gained had he stayed in Guggenex. He spent most of his time in 
Europe and took up residence in Paris, where he had numerous 
French mistresses. His traveling and philandering soon meant 
that he and Florette were man and wife in name only. He spent 
more and more of his time in Paris, where he invested in and 
worked for International Steam Pump, which had built the 
elevators for the Eiffel Tower. 

In April 1912, Benjamin decided to sail back to New York 
with his latest mistress, a young singer; after passage on anoth- 
er vessel had been postponed, they embarked on the Titanic. 
The ship's fatal maiden voyage would soon enter history. 
Benjamin and his faithful secretary, Victor Giglio— apparently 
having given their life jackets to others— were dressed in 
evening clothes, ready to die as heroes. Benjamin gave one of the 
stewards, who was to man a lifeboat into which women and 
children were loaded, a last message for Florette: "Tell her that 
I played the game straight to the end and that no woman was 
left on board this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward." 5 
The Titanic sank to the bottom of the sea, and over 1,500 pas- 
sengers went to their deaths. The mistress, however, was saved 
and in a rather ironic twist was referred to in a list of passen- 
gers published in The New York Times as Mrs. Benjamin 
Guggenheim. Once their Guggenheim uncles cleared up 
Benjamin's muddled business affairs— a process that took seven 
years — each daughter inherited $450,000, which was placed in 
trust. Contrary to popular belief, Peggy never had unlimited 
funds, though she was never by any standards poor. She learned 
to use her wits, and the use she made of her income would be 
imaginative and inventive. 

In many ways, Peggy never fully recovered from her father's 
death. She said that throughout her life she was searching to 
find in other men the beloved father she had lost too soon. 
Nonetheless, the relationship had not been a simple one. Peggy 
later summed up her feelings about him: "I adored my father 
because he was fascinating and handsome, and because he loved 
me. But I suffered very much because he made my mother 
unhappy." 6 In order to understand Peggy, it is important to keep 




in mind that she grew up in an unstable and unhappy family. 
Acutely aware of the alienation between their parents and placed 
in the care of governesses, Peggy as well as her sisters Benita 
and Hazel felt rejected. Even though there was no lack of tennis 
parties, beautiful clothes, and exotic pet dogs, Peggy wrote, 
"Not only was my childhood excessively lonely and sad, but it 
was also filled with torments." 7 The love of Peggy's childhood was 
her sister Benita, who served as substitute mother and best 
friend. Their portrait by Lenbach conveys that sisterly love, 
Peggy tenderly leaning against her sister's protective shoulder. 

Peggy and her sisters were taught history, music, and litera- 
ture by private tutors and governesses. From an early age, she 
had been exposed to culture and to traveling in Europe, including 
visits to museums. She had a "voracious appetite" for reading, 8 
which would be a lifelong passion. It was not until 1914 that 
Peggy attended a formal learning institution, the Jacoby School, 
a private school for Jewish girls in New York. After graduating in

1915, 9 she continued to study and was much influenced by one 
teacher in particular, Lucile Kohn, who "had a passion for bet- 
tering the world" 10 and taught her "about life, the poor and the 
needy, blacks and whites, etc." 11 Peggy wrote that it was thanks 
to Kohn that she "became radical and finally emerged from the 
stifling atmosphere in which I had been raised." 12 This break 
with her sheltered past would become more pronounced when 
Peggy turned twenty-one in 1919, and thus gained direct control 
of the income from her trust. Subsequently, her gifts of "count- 
less $100s" made it possible for Kohn to begin "a lifetime 
involvement with trade unions." 13 

After her birthday in 1919, Peggy celebrated her indepen- 
dence by traveling extensively in the United States. In the 
winter of 1920, "being very bored," Peggy, wishing for "a nose 
'tip-tilted like a flower,' something I had read about in 
Tennyson," 14 went to Cincinnati for a nose operation. The opera- 
tion was not a success, and "every time it rained, I knew it 
beforehand, because my nose became a sort of barometer and 
would swell up in bad weather." 15 Shortly afterward, Peggy's 
admittedly frivolous preoccupations took a more serious turn 
when Margaret Anderson, editor and publisher of The Little 
Review —the avant-garde magazine in which James Joyce's 
Ulysses was first published in America— asked for a donation: 
"She said that if people believed in preventing wars the best 
possible thing to do was to subscribe to the arts." 16 In youthful 
innocence, Peggy gave five hundred dollars to The Little Review, 
hoping to have put off the next world war for several years. 
This naive gesture was probably Peggy's first financial contribu- 
tion in favor of the arts. It is interesting to note the influence 
that independent women, such as Anderson and Kohn, had in 
her life from this early stage. These women introduced her to the 
arts and social issues; they encouraged her liberation of spirit 
and mind and a new social awareness. 

In 1920, Peggy temporarily substituted for her dentist's 
nurse. The experience— something quite extraordinary and 
unheard of for a young woman in her social position— left her 
feeling "in need of a job." 17 Peggy went to work for her cousin 
Harold Loeb, who was a coowner of Sunwise Turn, a radical 
bookshop located near Grand Central Terminal; the store also 
exhibited art. Loeb was the real-life inspiration for the character 
Robert Cohn in Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (1926). 
An enthusiastic, energetic, and eager worker, Peggy took care 
of the bookkeeping. The catch was that she worked for free; in 



compensation, she received a discount on any books she pur- 
chased: "In order to have the illusion of receiving a big salary, 
I bought many books of modern literature and read them 
all with my usual voracity." 18 Peggy's wealthy aunts came to buy 
books by the yard for their bookshelves at home. The bookshop 
was frequented by celebrated artistic and literary personalities, 
and there Peggy met Marsden Hartley; Leon Fleischman and 
his wife, Helen; and the flamboyant, blond-haired Laurence Vail. 
An artist and writer, Vail shocked, fascinated, and quite 
overwhelmed Peggy with his freedom. The Fleischmans intro- 
duced her to the art dealer and photographer Alfred Stieglitz, 
who showed her a Georgia O'Keeffe canvas, the first abstract 
painting that Peggy ever saw. 



Laurence Vail: The King of Bohemia 

After working at Sunwise Turn for six months, Peggy sailed to 
Europe, ostensibly for a visit, but she would end up living in 
France and England until the summer of 1941. In Paris, she 
again met Laurence Vail, who "was considered the King of 
Bohemia," 19 and it would be he who most changed Peggy's life in 
her early adult years— for better and for worse. Laurence, a 
more serious man than Peggy has described in her memoirs, had 
lived most of his life in France, where he was born in 1891 to 
American parents. His father, Eugene Vail, was a painter, and 
Laurence, who studied English literature at Oxford University, 
wrote plays and articles, translated books from French into 
English, painted, and made extraordinary collages and sculp- 
tures. Peggy and Laurence's romance flourished in Paris, and he 
proposed to her at the top of the Eiffel Tower. They married in 
1922, and while honeymooning in Capri they were joined by 
Laurence's sister, Clotilde, who traveled with them through Italy 
to Saint Moritz. Peggy found that she had married into a family 
as strange as her own. Laurence "was locked in a lifelong 
alliance with his sister which had been formed in childhood 
against their cold martinet of a mother with her chilly New 
England soul and their neurotic father." 20 Given the intensity of 
the relationship between Laurence and Clotilde, Peggy consid- 
ered her "the thorn in my marriage," 21 and their relationship 
would always be difficult. 

In many ways, Peggy and Laurence complemented each 
other. Laurence was not Jewish, and he "was a veritable soul of 
wit. Constantly amazed at life's contradictions, he was forever

alert to the absurd. He was worldly, ironic, sophisticated, mis- 
chievous, and no fool, although utterly impractical about 
money."' 22 His background and social circle were totally at odds 
with the family and Jewish society that Peggy had left behind in 
New York. To Laurence, Peggy was a young woman to whom he 
could teach art, literature, and life. She also had money, and this 
was no small attraction for him, particularly as he had always 
relied on the monthly checks his mother sent him. Perhaps 
inevitably, Laurence's passionate, at times violent, nature and 
Peggy's inexperience and immaturity were not conducive to a 
happy marriage. Quickly, husband and wife began to quarrel, 
and the years with Laurence would be tumultuous. 

Paris in the 1920s was the center of an intense intellectual, 
artistic, and social life. Writers and artists haunted the tables of 
such Montparnasse cafes as Le Dome and, just across the way, 
La Rotonde. Laurence spent hours sitting in cafes with Clotilde, 
drinking, talking, looking, and being looked at. Djuna Barnes, 
Mary Reynolds— two women who, according to Peggy, "had the 
kind of nose I had gone all the way to Cincinnati for in vain" 23 — 
The New Yorker art critic Robert Coates, Marcel Duchamp, Man 
Ray, and writer and publisher Robert McAlmon were just some 
of the friends, including many expatriate Americans, with whom 
Peggy and Laurence spent time during the day and at parties 
that went on all night. It is not surprising that this Parisian 
milieu had a significant effect on Peggy's growing artistic aware- 
ness. Years later, however, Peggy said that "perhaps I didn't like 
Paris in the twenties, everyone was drinking. I tried hard to be 
bohemian but I was really not convinced. ... I have never 
smoked opium myself. I am too much of a puritan." 24 She was 
unconventional but had a practical personality. In contrast to 
her desire to shock people, she was always aware of her social 
position, of her American, albeit Jewish, upper-class background. 

In 1923, my father, Sindbad Vail, was born in England, 
where Peggy and Laurence had gone for the birth so that their 
child, if male, could avoid the obligation of military service in 
France. When Peggy was thin again, she let herself be pho- 
tographed by Man Ray in a glamorous gold-lame evening dress 
designed by the famous couturier Paul Poiret. Captured in 
a sophisticated pose, she wears a headdress made by Vera 
Soudeikine, the longtime mistress and later wife of Igor 
Stravinsky. Laurence liked Peggy to dress extravagantly, and 
he himself was noted for his eccentric attire: shirts made from 
unusual fabrics as well as jackets and pants in bright colors.

In between wild parties and marital rows in Paris, trips to 
the Tyrol, to Italy, and even to Egypt were undertaken. What 
Peggy enjoyed most was "getting acquainted with Venice on foot. 
Laurence had lived there as a child for his father had always 
gone there in the autumn to paint. Laurence knew every stone, 
every church, every painting in Venice; in fact he was its second 
Ruskin. He walked me all over this horseless and autoless city 
and I developed for it a lifelong passion." 25 

During a trip to New York in 1925, Peggy— pregnant with 
her second child — arranged for the exhibition and sale in gal- 
leries and department stores of flower cut-outs by Mina Loy. 
Having returned to France, Peggy and Laurence departed for 
Switzerland, where a daughter, Pegeen, was born. Although 
this did not do much to tame Peggy's and Laurence's undomesti- 
cated spirits, they decided to live in the south of France in 
Pramousquier, near Le Lavandou. Their house, formerly an inn, 
had a particular appeal because Jean Cocteau and his lover 
Raymond Radiguet— who died in 1923— had stayed there. They 
had many visitors, including Peggy's cousin Harold Loeb, Loy 
and her two daughters, the Surrealist painter Andre Masson, 
Reynolds, and Clotilde. 

The artist Alfred Courmes, who had become friends with 
Clotilde, spent time with all the Vails in Pramousquier as well 
as in Paris. As a token of his friendship, and grateful for the 
welcome he had received from them, he painted a classical and 
formal portrait of Peggy, with the Vails' car, a red Dietrich- 
Lorraine, and the Mediterranean in the background. However, it 
seems that Peggy did not much care for the portrait and decided 
not to acquire it. 

Peggy and Laurence alternated between Paris and their 
country life in Pramousquier. Laurence worked on his novel 
Murder! Murder! (1931), a funny and hurtful satire of their life 
together. In 1925, Peggy undertook a retail venture with Loy, 
which apparently lasted into 1928. Peggy rented a shop— located 
on the chic rue du Colisee in Paris— that was set up to sell Loy's 
lamp bases and shades. In running the shop, Peggy discovered 
that she had a talent for business, but Loy found the experience 
stifling and stressful. 

Man Ray's talented assistant Berenice Abbott, wanting to 
strike off on her own, borrowed money from Peggy to set up her 
own photography studio in 1926. A grateful Abbott repaid the 
debt by taking lovely photographs of Peggy sporting fashionably 
short hair, wearing exotic earrings and bright lipstick, and

holding her small children or her dog. Abbott admired Peggy, 
whom she considered a person of genuine seriousness. 

Life with John Holms 

In the summer of 1927, Peggy learned of the second tragedy in 
her life when she inadvertently opened a telegram addressed 
to Laurence. In this abrupt manner, she found out that Benita 
had died in childbirth, and that her child was born dead too. 
Peggy never forgave herself for not having been with her sister 
in New York. She believed that a jealous Laurence had kept 
the sisters apart, and the couple's growing estrangement was 
exacerbated by the fact that Laurence resented Peggy's lengthy 
period of mourning for Benita. 

That winter, Peggy met the anarchist Emma Goldman, and 
subsequently, in the summer of 1928, Goldman worked on her 
memoirs, entitled Living My Life (1931), in a house that Peggy 
provided for her in Saint-Tropez. Goldman's secretary, Emily 
Coleman, "a mad American girl" 26 passionately interested in peo- 
ple, literature, and life, was in love with John Holms, an English 
writer. He was greatly admired by Edwin Muir, who with his 



28 



wife, Willa, translated the writings of Franz Kafka into English. 
Peggy was immediately attracted to Holms: "He had a magnifi- 
cent physique. . . . and looked very much like Jesus Christ." 27 
The evening that Peggy met Holms was on the first anniversary 
of Benita's death. The fateful kiss they gave each other— soon 
after Peggy had danced on a table in a Saint-Tropez bistro — 
marked the end of Peggy's marriage to Laurence. Some weeks 
later, Peggy and Holms ran off together. As part of the divorce 
settlement, it was agreed that Peggy should have custody of 
Pegeen and Laurence custody of Sindbad; the divorce itself was 
not final until 1930. Peggy and Laurence— who soon took up 
with, and later married, the novelist Kay Boyle— came to have a 
friendlier relationship as the years passed, and their children 
would spend considerable time visiting with each parent. 

Peggy later acknowledged her debt to Holms: "During the 
five years that I lived with him, I began to learn everything I 
know today. When I first met him I was like a baby in a kinder- 
garten, but by degrees he taught me everything and sowed 
the seeds in me that sprouted after he was no longer there to 
guide me." 28 In the spring of 1932, after an active life in 
Paris and much traveling throughout Europe, they settled 
in England, near Dartmoor in Devon. They lived at Hayford 
Hall, which was dubbed "Hangover Hall." 29 Djuna Barnes, 
the painter Louis Bouche and his family, Coleman, Wyn 
Henderson— Peggy's future assistant at Guggenheim Jeune— 
and the novelist Antonia White were among the frequent visi- 
tors. It was here that the talented, chic, and dynamic, but rather 
resentful, Barnes— to whom Peggy had been giving financial 
support— wrote her famous novel Nightwood, which she dedicat- 
ed to Peggy and Holms when it was published in 1936. (Until 
Peggy died, she sent Barnes a monthly stipend, and Sindbad 
generously continued to do so until his own death.) 

Holms— who could write brilliantly but whose promise was 
largely unfulfilled because he was unable to write a book— 
conversed with Peggy and their guests when he was not drink- 
ing heavily. The couple also spent much time in London. In 
January 1934, Holms died during what should have been a rou- 
tine operation to reset a dislocated wrist. Apparently, the high 
level of alcohol in his blood combined with the anesthetic caused 
heart failure. Peggy had suddenly lost the man she would 
always consider the love of her life. She wondered if she could 
have prevented the deaths of those closest and dearest to her: 
first her father, then Benita, and now Holms. Regarding these

deaths, her sense of helplessness was understandable. However, 
in situations during which she might have exercised genuine 
responsibility she often did not do so. Throughout Peggy's life, 
she tended to be least protective of those people to whom she 
had the most personal obligations, such as her lovers, children, 
or grandchildren. 

Within a few months of Holms's death, Peggy began an affair 
with Douglas Garman, whom she had met and been attracted 
to while Holms was still alive. Garman, a fanatical Communist, 
worked as a publisher for a progressive publishing house in 
London. In a domestic fashion of sorts, in the summer of 1935, 
they began to live together in Yew Tree Cottage in the country- 
side, southwest of London, near the small town of Petersfield. 
In the spring of 1936, when the International Surrealist 
Exhibition opened at the New Burlington Galleries, Peggy 
refused— ironically in light of the way her life would soon devel- 
op—to go to London; the city still reminded her too much of 
Holms. For ten days in the summer, however, she did go to 
Venice. Years later, she wrote fondly of this trip, "I revisited all 
my favorite churches and museums, and felt the same delight 
I always had in [the Venetian Renaissance painter] Carpaccio." 30 
Differing more and more over politics, and also because Garman 
refused to marry Peggy, the couple ended their relationship 
early in 1937. 



Guggenheim Jeune 

A turning point for Peggy occurred in May 1937, when her close 
friend Peggy Waldman wrote to her suggesting that she do 
something serious with her life, such as open an art gallery or 
establish a publishing house, "anything that would be engross- 
ing yet impersonal." 31 Thinking that an art gallery would be 
a less expensive venture than a publishing house, she opted for 
the former little knowing how much energy and money she 
would pour into it. In true Guggenheim fashion, she liked 
the idea of becoming a patron of the arts— and perhaps also 
making a profit. Peggy's financial ability to start a gallery was 
strengthened by an inheritance from her mother, who died 
that November in New York. 

Although Peggy's contacts had been mainly with literary 
figures, she quickly embraced the world of avant-garde art. 
Humphrey Jennings, then a Surrealist painter but later a film- 
maker, helped her look for a gallery space in London. In Paris,

he introduced her to such Surrealists as Andre Breton, known 
as the "Pope of Surrealism," and Yves Tanguy. The collaboration 
with Jennings was short-lived, and Peggy hired her bright and 
energetic friend Wyn Henderson as her assistant. It was 
Henderson who decided to name the gallery Guggenheim Jeune, 
a clever pun on the name of the famous gallery Bernheim Jeune 
in Paris. Guggenheim Jeune was located at 30 Cork Street, in 
the heart of Piccadilly. 

Peggy knew virtually nothing about Modern art: "At that 
time I couldn't distinguish one thing in art from another." 32 
Her personal taste had been largely for Renaissance art and the 
Old Masters. In fact, she had read all of Bernard Berenson's 
books and swore by his aesthetic principles. She turned to 
Marcel Duchamp, a lover of her and Laurence Vail's friend Mary 
Reynolds, for guidance. He taught Peggy the difference between 
abstract and Surrealist art and introduced her to Jean Arp, Jean 
Cocteau, and many other artists. The charismatic Duchamp 



31 



had become a legend when his controversial painting Nude 
Descending a Staircase No. 2 (1912, Philadelphia Museum of 
Art) was exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. 
Having previously advised the American collectors Louise and 
Walter Arensberg and Katherine Dreier, Duchamp was happy 
to counsel Peggy on her future purchases. It is to Peggy's credit 
that she was wise enough to diligently follow the advice of 
Duchamp and later advisers. 

Peggy wanted to devote the first Guggenheim Jeune exhibi- 
tion to Constantin Brancusi, but the sculptor was not in Paris 
when Peggy came over to make arrangements. Duchamp sug- 
gested an exhibition of works by Cocteau, whom Peggy duly 
visited in his opium-scented hotel room in Paris. Duchamp also 
introduced her to Arp, "an excellent poet and a most amusing 
man." 33 She fell in love with his brass sculpture Head and Shell 
(ca. 1933): "The instant I felt it I wanted to own it." 34 It was 
to be the first artwork to enter Peggy's collection. 

Through her old friend Helen Fleischman, now married to 
James Joyce's son, Giorgio, Peggy was introduced to Samuel 
Beckett in December 1937. He fascinated her, and she talked 
with him about literature and art. When Peggy admitted 
to Beckett that she preferred Old Master paintings, he strongly 
encouraged her to accept and encourage the art of their day, 
"as it was a living thing." 35 In addition to his passion for Joyce, 
he admired the painters Jack Yeats (brother of William Butler 
Yeats) and Geer van Velde. An odd relationship— more of a 
strange sexual friendship than a truly amorous affair— ensued

with Beckett, who liked liberated women. Peggy ultimately 
found him to be too passive and eccentric; she nicknamed him 
"Oblomov" after the neurotic, indolent hero of Ivan Goncharov's 
1858 novel. She certainly did not, and perhaps could not, fathom 
this complex intellectual, and she infringed too much on his 
privacy. Peggy was undoubtedly in love with Beckett in her own 
erratic way, and they went on seeing each other from time to 
time during the remainder of the late 1930s. 

Peggy's life was hectic; she divided her time between Paris 
and London, particularly because of the arrangements being 
made for Cocteau's exhibition (January 24-February 12, 1938). 
The exhibition would include drawings and furniture designed 
for his play Les Chevaliers de la Table Ronde, which had 
opened in Paris in October 1937, as well as other drawings and 
objects. One of two drawings on linen bedsheets, which included 
a portrait of Jean Marais— who acted in the play and was a 
recent discovery of Cocteau's— caused a scandal with British cus- 
toms inspectors; they objected to the depiction of pubic hair, 
which had been modestly pinned over with a few leaves. 
This piece was released on the condition that it not be exhibited

to the general public, and Peggy only showed it to a few people 
in private. Beckett translated Cocteau's catalogue text into 
English. The exhibition opened to great fanfare, but without 
Duchamp, who did not attend openings, and without a hospital- 
ized Beckett, who sent a telegram of congratulations to a jubi- 
lant Peggy. Simultaneously in Paris, the huge 1938 International 
Exhibition of Surrealism was being held, and reports of its wild 
opening were linked to Peggy's opening, much to her delight. 

Peggy continued to let herself be guided in a docile fashion 
by Duchamp, on whose recommendation she exhibited the 
abstract work of Vasily Kandinsky (February 18-March 12); it 
was his first solo exhibition in England. Kandinsky had formerly 
enjoyed good fortune with Solomon Guggenheim, who, together 
with his wife, Irene, and his artistic adviser, Hilla Rebay, had 
visited the artist in his studio in Dessau in 1929. On this occa- 
sion, Solomon had bought his first oil painting by Kandinsky, an 
abstraction entitled Composition 8 (1923). Rebay encouraged 
Solomon to collect Kandinsky's work. Destined to become the 
first director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (which 
would open in 1939 and be renamed the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum in 1952), she enthusiastically embraced 
the art of her time. Herself a painter, she was passionately inter- 
ested in nonobjective painting, believing that it was infused 
with spirituality. By 1938, however, Kandinsky, once supported 
so fiercely, had been supplanted by the lesser artist Rudolf 
Bauer, who was now greatly favored by an enamored Rebay. 

The Guggenheim Jeune exhibition of Kandinsky works from 
1909 to 1937 had a catalogue that included a preface by Andre 
Breton, the Surrealist artist that Kandinsky felt closest to. 
Peggy wrote to Solomon offering to sell to him, at Kandinsky's 
insistence, an early work that he had apparently once desired. 
This prompted Rebay 's wrath; she believed that Peggy was slan- 
dering her family's good name: "It is extremely distasteful at this 
moment, when the name of Guggenheim stands for an ideal in 
art, to see it used for commerce," she wrote to Peggy. 36 To a third 
party, Rebay observed, "Peggy Guggenheim is trying to ride 
on our fame," but finished on a more positive note, "however, I 
believe it can do only good if she buys lots of paintings of the 
poor starving painters in times like this." 37 Solomon did not buy 
a Kandinsky from his niece, but in 1945 he acquired Dominant 
Curve (April 1936) from the German dealer Karl Nierendorf; 
Peggy, who had bought the painting from her Kandinsky exhibi- 
tion, later regretted that she had sold it to Nierendorf.

An exhibition of celebrity portraits by Cedric Morris 
(March 18-April 7) was followed by Exhibition of Contemporary 
Sculpture (April 8-May 2), which was proposed by Duchamp. 
Arp helped Duchamp with the selection, which was made up of 
works by Arp, Brancusi, Alexander Calder, Raymond Duchamp- 
Villon, Henri Laurens, Henry Moore, Antoine Pevsner, and 
Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Much of the sculpture was shipped from 
Paris, and more problems with British customs ensued. James 
B. Manson, director of the Tate Gallery, London, refused to 
certify the sculptures as art, thus subjecting them to import 
duties. A petition was signed by art critics, and finally the House 
of Commons voted to let the works in duty-free. Manson left 
his post shortly thereafter. By the time the exhibition opened, it 
was already famous, much to Peggy's delight and credit. Further, 
the presence of Arp, a cofounder of Dada, was particularly invig- 
orating for British artists. Moore was thrilled to be shown 
"alongside other European sculptors" 38 and always grateful to 
Peggy for the opportunity. The London art scene had been sleepy 
in comparison with that of Paris, but there were now such gal- 
leries as the Mayor Gallery and the London Gallery, Peggy's

neighbors on Cork Street. The London Gallery, owned by the 
wealthy writer, painter, and collector Roland Penrose, was 
directed by E. L. T. Mesens, editor of London Bulletin, the official 
forum of the British Surrealists. Mesens arranged to run off 
copies of catalogues for exhibitions held at the Cork Street gal- 
leries. Penrose and the poet David Gascoyne were largely 
responsible for encouraging Surrealism in London. Their efforts 
led in 1936 to the International Surrealist Exhibition at the 
New Burlington Galleries. The exhibition was a succes de scan- 
dale, spurred on by the defiant catalogue introduction written 
by art historian Herbert Read, who would become an important 
figure in Peggy's life. 

Guggenheim Jeune became a catalyst in the growing appre- 
ciation for Modern art in England. The gallery's first season 
included a solo exhibition, which had been proposed by Beckett, 
of paintings and gouaches by his friend van Velde (May 5-26). 
Next came two simultaneous solo exhibitions of works by 
Benjamin Benno, a friend of Pablo Picasso, and Rita Kernn- 
Larsen (May 31- June 18). These were followed by Exhibition of 
Contemporary Painting and Sculpture (June 21- July 2), which 
showed works by such British artists as Eileen Agar, Edward 
Burra, and Paul Nash alongside others by continental artists 
such as Max Ernst, Kandinsky, and Rene Magritte. This was the 
first time Peggy exhibited Ernst, but they would not actually meet 
until winter 1938-39. On the advice of Jennings, the season 
ended with a solo exhibition of paintings by Tanguy (July 6-16). 
It was "beautifully hung and looked wonderful," 39 as well as 
being, for the first time in the gallery's brief history, a small 
financial success. Peggy found the married Tanguy to be 
adorable and funny; inevitably, an intense affair between patron 
and artist ensued. For Peggy, Tanguy painted two miniatures 
for earring settings; Read said these were "the best Tanguys he 
had ever seen." 40 

Guggenheim Jeune's second season opened with Exhibition 
of Paintings and Drawings by Children (October 14-29), which 
included works by Peggy's daughter, Pegeen, and a teenage 
Lucian Freud. During this season, Piet Mondrian, then residing 
in London, visited the gallery and asked Peggy, much to her sur- 
prise and amusement, where the best nightclubs were, so that 
he could exercise his remarkable gift as a dancer. Peggy and the 
sculptor Llewellyn (the pseudonym by which she would refer 
to him in her memoirs) helped organize a three-day auction for a 
Spanish relief committee in November. From the auction, Peggy

herself bought her first Ernst painting and a Llewellyn for what 
she called "normal prices." 41 Her comment is indicative of the 
fact that, despite her generosity, she was invariably thrifty. 

The second season continued with Exhibition of Collages, 
Papiers-colles, and Photo-montages (November 4-26), which was 
installed by Penrose and included works by Arp, Ernst, Kurt 
Schwitters, Taeuber-Arp, and Laurence Vail, among many oth- 
ers. Simultaneous solo exhibitions of pottery by Jill Salaman and 
works in various mediums by Marie Vassilieff (December 2-23) 
were followed by a show devoted to Grace W. Pailthorpe, a psy- 
chiatrist and surgeon, and Reuben Mednikoff (January 10-31, 
1939), both of whom explored the unconscious through automatic 
paintings and drawings. Solo exhibitions for Wolfgang Paalen 
(February 15-March 11), John Tunnard (March 16-April 8), 



37 



Henghes (April 14-May 6), and Charles Howard (April 14- 
May 6), led up to Exhibition of Abstract and Concrete Art 
(May 11-27), which included works by such artists as Arp, 
Calder, Barbara Hepworth, Kandinsky, Mondrian, and 
Ben Nicholson. 42 

Guggenheim Jeune closed after the simultaneous presenta- 
tions of a solo exhibition for Julian Trevelyan (June 8-22) 
and S. W. Hayter's Studio 17 (June 8-23). Read wrote the pref- 
ace to the joint catalogue. At the urging of Llewellyn, two special 
series of signed prints from Stanley W. Hayter's Studio 17 
were sold to benefit Spanish refugees. Peggy herself bought 
two sets: one illustrated Paul Eluard's poem "Solidarite," which 
had been translated into English by Beckett's friend the poet 
Brian Coffey; and the other illustrated Stephen Spender's poem 
"Fraternity," which had been translated into French by Louis 
Aragon. The prints were by such artists as Picasso, Kandinsky, 
Joan Miro, and Tanguy, among others. On June 22, a farewell 
party was held at Guggenheim Jeune during which the photog- 
rapher Gisele Freund showed "projections of colour-photography 
of famous contemporary artists." 43 Around this time, Freund 
photographed Peggy— wearing a classic string of pearls and 
bright red lipstick and nails that matched perfectly with the 
silk ribbon contour of her suit— together with Read, the two sit- 
ting earnestly in front of Tanguy's The Sun in Its Jewel Case 
(1937), which she had recently acquired. 

Just a few months before, in March, Peggy had conceived 
the idea of opening a museum of Modern art because the gallery 
was losing money, despite its being a successful artistic and cul- 
tural venture. She approached Read, who had been the editor 
of The Burlington Magazine in London since 1933. In such books 
as The Meaning of Art (1931), Art Now (1933), Art and Industry 
(1934), Art and Society (1936), and Surrealism (1936), he wrote 
about art in general as well as contemporary art. He had been 
involved in organizing the 1936 International Surrealist 
Exhibition, and his friends included the circle of artists around 
Hepworth, Moore, and Nicholson. Through his writings and 
his active involvement with artists, he had done much to popu- 
larize avant-garde art in the English-speaking world. He had 
been interested in founding a museum of Modern art in 
Edinburgh, where he was teaching in 1931, but when he heard 
from Peggy that she wanted him to run a museum she was 
planning to create in London, he was skeptical at first. Penrose 
had been initially involved, but he and Peggy soon disagreed

bitterly. Reluctant to renounce his secure post at The Burlington 
Magazine, Read finally decided to accept Peggy's offer as long 
as he could borrow one year's salary to buy a partnership in the 
publishing house Routledge. In return, he was ready to defer 
the first six months of his salary until the museum would open. 
Peggy cut back significantly on her personal expenses, as she 
believed that "every penny that I could raise was to be used for 
the museum." 44 

Peggy's proposed museum in London was modeled on the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York, whose departments 
and programs dealt not only with the traditional mediums of 
painting and sculpture but also with photography, design, film, 
and architecture. The London museum was intended to be a 
center for visual and performing arts, what Read referred to as 
"a sympathetic linking of all the arts in their modern aspects." 45 
Proposals for a theater — for performances of music and recitals 
of poetry — a library, and various galleries were articulated. 
Read wrote: 



It is quite conceivable that, as it may develop, paintings 
will play only a subordinate part in the scheme. The idea is 
rather to create a focus for whatever creative activity and 
critical appreciation there is to be found in this country; to 
define and defend the modern tradition; to create an atmos- 
phere in which that tradition can develop. ... it will be a 
historic sequence in which each picture is a necessary link, 



40 



and historical significance will be even more important than 
aesthetic significance. 46 

Finding a suitable site was not easy, but then the London 
residence of art historian Kenneth Clark on Portland Place 
became available. Peggy was relatively oblivious to the impend- 
ing war with Germany; she would later write with her usual 
honesty: "Lady Clark . . . told me she was going to live in 
the country to please her children. I was so silly I did not realize 
that she was preparing for the fast approaching war, and I 
thought I was very lucky to acquire her house." 47 (Indeed, war 
was declared in September, and the lease was never signed. ) 
A list for the museum's opening exhibition had been drawn up 
with Read's help, and after a summer holiday in the south 
of France, Peggy left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks. 

A Picture a Day 

When World War II began, Peggy abandoned her plans for a 
London museum and decided not to go back to England. 
She began to use Read's list— which would be revised by Peggy's 
friend Nelly van Doesburg, the widow of Theo van Doesburg, 
and Marcel Duchamp— as the basis for assembling a private 
collection of abstract and Surrealist art. Peggy took this opportu- 
nity to visit such artists as Albert Gleizes, Vasily Kandinsky, 
and Yves Tanguy, whose painting Promontory Palace (1931) 
she was able to buy from Tanguy 's soon-to-be ex-wife, Jeannette. 
Peggy "conceived a wonderful scheme of forming an artists' 
colony for the duration of the war," but shortly came to her sens- 
es: "As soon as I got back to Paris and met a few of the people 
we had thought of inviting, I realized what a hell life would have 
been." 48 Although she had to face the unpleasant task of dismiss- 
ing Herbert Read, they were to remain friends and continued 
to correspond with and see each other in the years to come. 
In fact, Peggy considered Read to be a father-figure who "treated 
me the way Disraeli treated Queen Victoria" 49 ; he would often 
sign his letters to her with an affectionate "Papa." 

In addition to Duchamp and Nelly van Doesburg, Peggy 
was helped in her endeavor by Howard Putzel, who had initially 
corresponded with her from California on the occasion of the 
opening of Guggenheim Jeune. He was passionate about Modern 
art and subsequently sent some of his own Tanguys to her 
Tanguy exhibition. He had already been befriended by Duchamp, 



41 



Max Ernst, and Tanguy, and— eager to get to know them in 
person— in 1938 he closed his gallery in Los Angeles and 
moved to Paris. He ended up meeting Peggy at the home of 
Mary Reynolds, and he was delighted to help her assemble 
a collection. 

In the winter of 1938-39, Putzel introduced Peggy to Ernst, 
who was then involved with the painter Leonora Carrington. 
Peggy described Ernst as having "a handsome beak-like nose 
resembling a bird's. He was exquisitely made." 50 Possibly in 
order to please Ernst, Peggy bought Carrington's fantastic and 
rather sensuous The Horses of Lord Candlestick (1939). This 
was Carrington's first sale, and Peggy eventually gave the 
painting to Sindbad. 

That winter, Peggy also spent time with the American com- 
poser and critic Virgil Thomson, who was her fond admirer. 
She "thought it would be nice to marry Virgil to have a musical 
background, but I never got far with the project" 51 (a comment 
perhaps intended as an inside joke given the fact that Thomson 
was a homosexual). He composed a musical portrait of Peggy 
in the form of his Piano Sonata no. 4 (Guggenheim Jeune), a 
"relatively straightforward tonal piece." 52 Peggy did not find it 
"in the least resembling" although she had "posed quietly for 
several hours" for Thomson. 53 

Peggy's life during the war was extraordinary to say the 
least. From the time war was declared at the beginning of 
September until April 1940, when the Germans invaded Norway 
and Denmark, a "phony war" seemed to be taking place. Many 
in Western Europe had been lulled into a false sense of security, 
but even as the Germans advanced through the Low Countries 
and on into France during May and June, Peggy remained 
undaunted by the situation. During this short period, Peggy 
assiduously bought works of art with the funds that had previ- 
ously been allocated for her museum project. Her motto was 
"buy a picture a day." 54 

Peggy rented Kay Sage's apartment on the He Saint-Louis 
behind Notre-Dame on the quai d'Orleans. An American heiress 
and a painter, Sage— whom Peggy liked to call "Princess" because 
she was still married to an Italian prince— soon became Tanguy's 
wife. Peggy gave dinner parties in the apartment, which had 
a terrace and a big studio with plenty of light; she would remem- 
ber being "happy as all my life I had wanted to live by a river." 55 
It was a perfect time for Peggy, and she went to artists' studios 
and art dealers in order to buy artworks. The uncertainty of war

meant that although artists were more anxious to sell, there 
were fewer buyers; artworks were more readily available, 
and the prices were quite cheap. A photograph by Rogi Andre, 
a former pupil and the first wife of Andre Kertesz, shows a 
proud Peggy next to Constantin Brancusi's sculpture Maiastra 
(1912 [?]), which she bought from Nicole Groult, a sister of 
Paul Poiret. Peggy had previously failed to buy Bird in Space 
(1932-40) from Brancusi; she had an argument with the artist 
because she felt that he had demanded an excessively high 
price. Months later, Peggy succeeded in buying it at a discount 
with the help of van Doesburg and a good exchange rate. 

Peggy bought a Jean Helion painting (which she subsequent- 
ly exchanged), little knowing he would later become her son-in- 
law. She purchased Salvador Dali's Birth of Liquid Desires 
(1931-32) directly from his wife, Gala; although she did not par- 
ticularly care for the Spanish painter, his name was 
on her list, and she was disciplined enough to buy his work. The 
acquisition of Alberto Giacometti's sculpture Woman with Her 
Throat Cut (1932, cast 1940) followed after Peggy went to visit 
the sculptor in his studio on avenue du Maine; he personally 
delivered it to the He Saint-Louis apartment. However, she had 
no luck with Pablo Picasso, who mistook her for a bourgeois 
housewife with her shopping list and dismissed her abruptly 
from his studio. 

Andre's photographs of a lively and carefree Peggy seem all 
the more ironic as she shows off her latest acquisitions. During 



44 




the last months before Paris fell to the Germans in June, 
Peggy kept up the pace of her purchases, acquiring "fifty works, 
thirty-seven of which are still in the collection" 56 : four Jean 
Arps, one Giacomo Balla, two Brancusis, one Georges Braque, 
one Giorgio de Chirico, two Dalis, one Robert Delaunay, one 
Theo van Doesburg, one Raymond Duchamp-Villon, two Ernsts, 
two Giacomettis, one Gleizes, one Paul Klee, one Fernand 
Leger, one El Lissitzky, one Rene Magritte, three Man Rays, 
one Louis Marcoussis, one Joan Miro, one Piet Mondrian, two 
Pevsners, one Francis Picabia, one Kurt Schwitters, one Gino 
Severini, one Georges Vantongerloo, and one Jacques Villon. 
According to art historian Angelica Zander Rudenstine, "At least 
twenty of those works were purchased directly from the individ- 
ual artists, nine from dealers, four from Nelly van Doesburg . . . 
and two from Duchamp. . . . Other works bought during 
this same period were later given away or (in rare cases) sold." 57 

Peggy presently needed more space to store her growing 
collection. After a failed attempt to secure the apartment where 
Frederic Chopin had died, on the place Vendome, the most sensi- 
ble thing seemed to be that the artworks should be sent out 
of Paris. Leger suggested that the Musee du Louvre might give 
her storage space in the country, where the museum was send- 
ing its own paintings, but she was told that hers "were too 
modern and not worth saving." 58 After temporarily sending her 
collection to a chateau outside Vichy— and with the Germans 
advancing fast on Paris— Peggy finally decided to head to 
the Alps to be near Laurence and their children, Pegeen and

Sindbad, who were living in Megeve. Peggy soon settled nearby 
in Grenoble, and luckily, Nelly van Doesburg was a friend of 
Andre Farcy, director of the Musee de Grenoble, who agreed to 
hide her artworks in the museum's cellar until they could be 
shipped to New York. Thanks to the good sense of Peggy's ship- 
per, Rene Lefebvre-Foinet, the collection was packed among 
personal belongings, so that there would be less potential for 
problems with customs officials. 



Passage to America 

The situation for refugees — including artists, intellectuals, and 
political activists— in France was difficult and perilous. The 
Emergency Rescue Committee— formed under the auspices 
of the American Federation of Labor, the Museum of Modern Art, 
New York, and other groups— was run by an American, Varian 
Fry, who had come to France to provide refugees with passports 
and visas to the United States. Among the refugees were many 
Surrealists and their families. When not at their headquarters 
in Marseilles, Fry and his staff stayed nearby in a derelict 
villa called Air-Bel. Andre Breton and his family as well as the 
writer Victor Serge were also put up at the villa. Kay Sage 
cabled Peggy in Grenoble asking her to help finance the passage 
to America of the Bretons, Max Ernst, and Pierre Mabille, a 
favorite doctor of the Surrealists. After some protest, Peggy 
agreed to help the Bretons and Max. She also took up the cause 



48 



of the Jewish Romanian artist Victor Brauner, but the Romanian 
quota was so small that he was unable to get a visa. She would 
continue to give financial support to Breton after he arrived in 
New York. Forever grateful for her help and generosity, he would 
write to her in 1965: "Je n'ai pas pour autant oublie New York, 
ni ce Marseille au tournant de 1940 d'ou j'ai pu m'evader a 
temps grace a vous. C'est evidemment une des grandes dates de 
ma vie et je ne pense jamais sans emotion que tout a dependu 
alors de votre genereuse intervention." 59 (I have certainly not 
forgotten New York, nor Marseilles at the turn of 1940 when I

tant dates in my life and I never think without emotion that 
everything depended on your generous intervention. ) 

Peggy wrote to Max, at the suggestion of Laurence and Rene 
Lefebvre-Foinet, asking him for a painting in exchange for pay- 
ing for his passage to America. She sent him money so that 
he could rescue some of his sculptures, which had been left in a 
house that Leonora Carrington had foolishly signed over to a 
Frenchman just before she left France. Peggy subsequently 
began an affair with Max, even though he was still pining after 
Carrington and was interested in Leonor Fini, whose painting 
The Shepherdess of the Sphinxes (1941) Peggy rather reluctantly 
bought at Max's instigation. By the spring of 1941, Max, Peggy, 
Laurence, and Kay Boyle were all waiting in Marseilles for pas- 
sage to America. Laurence and Boyle were there with their own 
as well as Peggy's children; the couple's marriage was effectively 
over although they would not be legally divorced until 1943. 
This cast of characters moved on to Lisbon, where they awaited 
permission to leave for New York. Their life in a Lisbon hotel 
was a tragicomedy that confused and unsettled everyone's lives. 
Long meals, days at the beach, and excursions ensued. 

Finally, on July 13, after an agonizing wait for a variety of 
legal papers, "eleven people: one husband, two ex-wives, one 
future husband and seven children" 60 boarded the Pan American 
Clipper in Lisbon to fly across the Atlantic to safer shores. After 
a long flight, Peggy, wearing a gigantic hat bought during a stop 
in the Azores, and entourage arrived in New York. Max's son, 
Jimmy Ernst, was there to meet them. He would write, movingly 
depicting Peggy as she came toward him, that "her body and 
walk suggested] considerable hesitation. . . . Her face was 
strangely childlike, but it expressed something I imagined the 
ugly duckling must have felt the first time it saw its reflection in 
the water. . . . The anxiety-ridden eyes were warm and almost

pleading, and the bony hands, at a loss where to go. . . . There 
was something about her that wanted me to reach out to her, 
even before she spoke." 61 Howard Putzel, "who resembled a well- 
worn teddy bear," 62 had already returned to New York and was 
also there to greet them. He reassured Peggy that her collection 
had arrived safely. Max was detained for several days, pending a 
hearing, because he was traveling with a German passport 
although he had lived in France since 1922. Julien Levy, who 
was Max's dealer and Mina Loy's son-in-law, was ready to testify 
on Max's behalf as were trustees of the Museum of Modern Art, 
but he was soon released to Jimmy's custody. Jimmy, who got 
along well with Peggy, was already apprehensive about the rela- 
tionship between her and his father. 

Peggy and Max went to see her uncle Solomon's museum, 
the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, located in a former auto- 
mobile showroom on East Fifty-fourth Street. She felt that "it 
really was a joke. There were about a hundred paintings by 
[Rudolf] Bauer . . . which overshadowed the twenty Kandinskys. 
. . . The museum was a beautiful little building completely wast- 
ed in this atrocious manner. Max called it the Bauer House; 
the Museum of Modern Art he called the Barr House [after its 
director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]; and [Albert E.] Gallatin's collection 
in the New York University building was the Bore House." 63 
She also took him to visit Solomon's personal collection, which 
was housed in his apartment at the Plaza Hotel; in contrast, she 
called it "a really fine collection of modern paintings." 64 Max's 
favorite New York museum was the American Museum of 
Natural History, and he also loved the Museum of the American 
Indian, Heye Foundation. 

Peggy and Max, accompanied by Pegeen and Jimmy, flew to 
San Francisco and then on to Los Angeles to visit her sister 
Hazel. Peggy was eager to see Louise and Walter Arensberg's 
superb collection at their Los Angeles home; among many other 
Modern masterpieces, the Arensbergs owned most of Marcel 
Duchamp's works (they later donated their collection to the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art). Peggy had already decided to 
revive her idea of establishing a museum and briefly looked for a 
site in California. However, she, Max, and the children soon 
departed by automobile to take a southern route back to New 
York. Traveling through Arizona, Max was transfixed by the 
desert landscapes he saw before him; they looked so much like 
the Surrealist landscapes he had painted from his imagination 
years ago in Europe.

By late September, Peggy and Max were back in New York, 
where they were destined to live in Hale House, a town house at 
440 East Fifty-first Street and Beekman Place, overlooking the 
East River. Peggy believed that it was "the ideal place for the 
museum, except that it was too far away from the center of 
town. But we couldn't resist it. We intended to sleep in the ser- 
vant's rooms when we were there, and to live in the country. 
However, we were not allowed to open a museum in this section. 
We had to take the house for ourselves to live in instead. It was 
the most beautiful house in New York." 65 It also had enough 
space for a studio for Max. Peggy's collection was casually dis- 
played, mostly propped up against the walls, and the American 
Indian objects that Max had begun to collect during their 
trip across the Southwest were arranged throughout the house. 

The Guggenheim-Ernst home quickly became a meeting 
place for displaced Surrealists and other European artists. 
Fantastic and memorable parties were held there, and it soon 
became one of the major social venues in the New York art 
world. Breton, happy to regroup his Surrealist colleagues and 
friends, was especially pleased to have reestablished friendly 
relations with Max, who had sided with Paul Eluard after a split 
among the Surrealists in 1938. 

Peggy soon came to know Barr, James Thrall Soby, who 
would become Barr's successor as director of the Museum of 
Modern Art, and James Johnson Sweeney, later Rebay's succes- 
sor as director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting. 
Max sold many paintings and bought primitive art. Handsome 
and photogenic, he enjoyed being a celebrity in New York. He

disliked being photographed with Peggy, however, although 
snapshots exist of them together with their dog Kachina, a 
Lhasa apso and the first of a long line of dogs that would keep 
Peggy company for the rest of her life. 

On December 7, 1941, the United States entered World 
War II after the Japanese attacked the naval base at Pearl 
Harbor. Peggy— who had long been pressuring Max into marry- 
ing her— was especially distressed by "the idea of living in sin 
with an enemy alien." 66 With the United States now at war 
with the Axis powers— Germany, Italy, and Japan— she was 
eager to legalize their relationship, and they were married in a 
simple ceremony on December 30. Their new legal status did 
nothing to stop the awful fights they often had. Nor did it pre- 
vent Max from refusing to use the intimate form of address, tu, 
when addressing Peggy. Nor did it prevent him from seeing 
Leonora Carrington, who had also taken refuge in New York. 
He married Peggy but did not love her. Their marital incompati- 
bility, however, did not slow down their social life. Parties 
continued unabated at Hale House, "the coolest place in New 
York," 67 or at the home of their collector friends Bernard 
and Becky Reis. 

Max had not yet included Peggy in any of his paintings. 
Then, one day in 1941, she noticed a small painting on his easel 
with several strange figures, one of which— with a horse's head— 
she read as being herself. Peggy called this painting The Mystic 
Marriage ("The Antipope," ca. 1941) and requested it as a 
wedding gift from him. He painted a larger version, entitled 
The Antipope (December 1941-March 1942), and the smaller one 
was thereafter given the same title (both are still in the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection). Readings of Surrealist compositions 
are problematic, but it is valid to take into account the complex 
relationships that existed among Carrington, who was herself 
passionately interested in horses, Max, Pegeen, and Peggy when 
looking at the figures in the two paintings: "It is against this 
background of intense and entangled relationships that Ernst 
produced both versions." 68 

Breton and Max helped Peggy in the process of completing 
her collection, for which she decided to publish a catalogue. 
The book, more an anthology than a catalogue, was entitled Art 
of This Century. Ernst designed its cover, and Breton, who wrote 
a preface, encouraged her to include a selection of manifestos 
of artistic movements as well as artists' statements; photographs 
cropped to show only the artists' eyes were also included. Piet

Mondrian wrote a preface, which the painter Charmion von 
Wiegand translated into English. Dedicated to John Holms, 
the book was published in May 1942. Thirty works still in the 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection were purchased in New York 
during the few months before the publication of the catalogue; 
these include such paintings as Marc Chagall's Rain (1911), 
Duchamp's Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train (1911-12), 
Vasily Kandinsky's White Cross (January-June 1922), and 
Joan Miro's Seated Woman II (February 27, 1939). 69 

Even before the influx of Surrealist refugees during World 
War II, there had been significant exposure to Surrealism in 
the United States. The first Surrealist exhibition in America, 
Newer Super-Realism, was held at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 
Hartford in 1931. Levy, who had been showing Surrealist art 
in his New York gallery since 1932, published an anthology, 
Surrealism, in 1936, and Barr organized the successful exhibi- 
tion Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism at the Museum of 
Modern Art in the same year. In 1940, the Surrealist magazine 
View was founded by the poet Charles Henri Ford, who edited it 
until its final issue in 1947; Ford dedicated several issues to 
individual artists, such as Duchamp and Max Ernst. From 
November 1941 to January 1942, the Museum of Modern Art 
held simultaneous exhibitions of works by Salvador Dali and 
Joan Miro. 

In 1942, the exhibition Artists in Exile, which included both 
Surrealist and abstract artists, was held at Pierre Matisse's 
gallery in New York. In this year, Peggy was one of the sponsors 
of Masters of Abstract Art, an exhibition held at Helena 
Rubinstein's New Art Center on Fifth Avenue to benefit the 
American Red Cross. Rubinstein and Elsa Schiaparelli, yet 
another wartime resident, played important roles in the diffu- 
sion and understanding of Modern and contemporary art in 
New York during the war years. Peggy, Rubinstein, and 
Schiaparelli were, as the art historian Leo Steinberg has so 
rightly said, literally "living feminism." 70 

The art critic Clement Greenberg thought "the Surrealist 
influence has become exaggerated" and that before the war 
Americans had seen "more good contemporary art in New York: 
Miro, Matisse, Klee, Kandinsky. . . . We saw a lot more than 
the French did." 71 Greenberg believed that those masters of 
Modern European art had more of an influence on American art 
than any of the Surrealists. The presence of the emigres, howev- 
er, clearly had a tremendous impact on New York artists, and it 



54 



was Matta (Roberto Sebastian Matta Echaurren) who probably 
had the most influence on the emerging Abstract Expressionists. 
A Chilean, he had been one of the younger members of the 
Surrealist circle in Paris. He organized evenings of Surrealist 
exercises, during which such artists as William Baziotes, 
Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell became familiar with 
automatism. Matta— fluent in English and personable— belonged 
to the same generation as these Americans, and he was able to 
undercut the influence of Breton. 

Art of This Century 

In 1942, Peggy still trying to get her museum started, finally 
leased space on the top floor at 30 West Fifty-seventh Street. At 
Howard Putzel's recommendation, Peggy asked the avant-garde 
architect Frederick Kiesler to design the galleries. In her first 
letter to Kiesler, dated February 26, she wrote, "Will you give me 
some advise [sic] about remodelling two tailor-shops into an 
Art Gallery?" 72 He felt challenged by the project, submitting a 
proposal on March 7, in which he acknowledged, "It is your wish 
that some new method be developed for exhibiting paintings, 
drawings, sculptures, collages and so called: objects." 73 As the 
curator Lisa Phillips would later write, Kiesler was given a 
unique opportunity to test "unorthodox ideas about the presenta- 
tion of art in a fantastic Surrealist environment that merged 
architecture, art, light, sound and motion." 74 He was intent on 
breaking down barriers between viewers and works of art. 
The displays were constructed to be "mobile and demountable," 
in Kiesler's words. 75 Most important, all the paintings were to be 
exhibited without their frames, free of yet another level of con- 
finement. Kiesler wrote: 

Today, the framed painting on the wall has become a decora- 
tive cipher without life and meaning. ... Its frame is at 
once symbol and agent of an artificial duality of "vision" and 
"reality," or "image" and "environment," a plastic barrier 
across which man looks from the world he inhabits to the 
alien world in which the work of art has its being. That 
barrier must be dissolved: the frame, today reduced to an 
arbitrary rigidity, must regain its architectural, spatial 
significance. The two opposing worlds must be seen again as 
jointly indispensable forces in the same world. The ancient 
magic must be recreated whereby the God and the mask of 



55 



the God, the deer and the image of the deer existed with 
equal potency, with the same immediate reality in one 
living universe. 76 

Kiesler had already begun to develop a method of spatial 
exhibition in Vienna in 1924, and Peggy's commission presented 
him with the perfect forum for fully bringing his ideas to 
fruition. Art of This Century, as the museum/gallery came to be 
called, contained four exhibition galleries, and a satisfied Peggy 
considered it "very theatrical and extremely original." 77 The 
abstract gallery "had movable walls made of stretched deep- 
blue canvas, laced to the floors and ceiling. . . . The floors were 
painted turquoise, Peggy's favorite color. Unframed pictures 
'swaying in space' at eye level were actually mounted on triangu- 
lar floor-to-ceiling rope pulleys resembling cat's cradles." 78 

The walls and ceiling of the Surrealist gallery were painted 
black. Unframed paintings were mounted on cantilevered wood- 
en arms that protruded from the curved gumwood panels 
attached to the walls. Viewers were free to adjust the angles 
at which they viewed the paintings. 

The kinetic gallery featured interactive displays. Works by 
Paul Klee were mounted on a mechanized belt that was set in 
motion by an electric eye. In order to see fourteen reproductions 
from Marcel Duchamp's Box in a Valise (1941), viewers had to 
peep through a hole and turn a wheel. A third kinetic object was 
a shadow box that displayed Andre Breton's Portrait of the 
Actor A. B. (1942); after lifting a lever, a diaphragm imprinted 
with Breton's image opened to reveal the poem-object within 
(the object was either destroyed or is lost). 

The daylight gallery and painting library shared one space. 
This gallery, more conventionally designed with white painted 
walls, was used for temporary exhibitions, and the windows 
along Fifty-seventh Street were covered with transparent fabric 
to filter the daylight. Within the same space, visitors could 
sit on folding stools and study the library of paintings that were 
stored in and could be displayed on open bins specially designed 
by Kiesler. 

Throughout Art of This Century were Kiesler's furniture 
units— in the form of biomorphic objects— that could be used for 
seating or for the display of artworks. Sculptures sat on some 
of the units, and paintings were mounted on sawed-off baseball 
bats that protruded from others. Kiesler believed that "no matter 
what the success of the enterprise— these galleries represent

the result of a splendid co-operation between the workmen, the 
owner and the designer." 79 

Elsa Schiaparelli asked Peggy to help organize a Surrealist 
exhibition to benefit the Coordinating Council of French Relief 
Societies. Peggy sent her to Breton, who, with the help of 
Max Ernst and Duchamp, organized First Papers of Surrealism , 
which was held in the Whitelaw Reid mansion on Madison 
Avenue. Duchamp decorated the interior with miles of string 
forming a huge web; viewers could hardly see the art, but 
the effect was stunning. Peggy headed the list of sponsors for the 
exhibition, which opened on October 14. Less than a week later, 
on the night of October 20, Art of This Century opened; one-dollar 
entry tickets benefited the American Red Cross. The opening— 
for which Peggy said she wore "one of my Tanguy earrings 



58 



and one made by [Alexander] Calder, in order to show my impar- 
tiality between Surrealist and abstract art" 80 — was a huge suc- 
cess with favorable articles appearing in the press. 

Art of This Century came on the scene at a time, when, as 
Sidney Janis would recall, "there were maybe a dozen galleries 
in all of New York." 81 It became such a popular meeting place 
for casual visitors, as well as for European and American artists, 
that Peggy took the unusual step of charging an admission fee of 
twenty-five cents, which she herself often collected. Eventually, 
she gave in to criticism from Putzel, as well as from Bernard 
Reis and Laurence Vail, against the practice and reverted to free 
admission. Peggy left her troubles with Max at home in the 
morning and spent the day at the gallery greeting visitors and 
planning exhibitions. Her relations with Jimmy Ernst continued 
to be friendly— indeed far more pleasant than those with his 
father— and for a short time he worked as her assistant. Peggy 
had decided, on the advice of Reis, that Art of This Century 
should not only be a museum space that exhibited European 
masters but also a commercial gallery that sold the paintings of 
young American artists. 

The temporary exhibitions held during the first season began 
with a triple presentation in December: Objects by Joseph 
Cornell; Marcel Duchamp: Box-Valise; and Laurence Vail: Bottles. 
Five of the Cornell objects exhibited, including Fortune Telling 
Parrot (Parrot Music Box) (ca. 1937-38), entered Peggy's collec- 
tion. Duchamp's leather valise contained replicas of his works 
and included one original photographic reproduction. The collage 
bottles by Laurence— a "greatly gifted artist," according to 
Greenberg 82 — were pioneering examples of assemblage. Wine 
bottles turned into works of art, they are intimate, often humor- 
ous objects onto which he pasted scraps of newspaper and 
magazine pictures, tattered materials, found objects, and shells. 

At Duchamp's instigation, Peggy held an exhibition wholly 
dedicated to women. Exhibition by 31 Women (January 5, 
1942-February 6, 1943) was selected by a jury that consisted 
of Breton, Duchamp, Jimmy Ernst, Max Ernst, Putzel, James 
Thrall Soby, James Johnson Sweeney, and Peggy. Peggy had 
asked Max to visit the women's studios, and one of the artists 
he visited was Dorothea Tanning, then married to a naval 
officer. Peggy considered Tanning to be "pretentious, boring, 
stupid, vulgar and dressed in the worst possible taste but was 
quite talented and imitated Max's painting, which flattered 
him immensely" 83 ; she always thought that Leonora Carrington

was superior to Tanning. Nonetheless, Max and Tanning began 
an affair, and they would marry in 1946 in a double ceremony 
with Man Ray and Juliet Browner. Exhibition by 31 Women 
included works by Xenia Cage (then married to John Cage), 
Leonora Carrington, Louise Nevelson, Meret Oppenheim, Irene 
Rice Pereira, Kay Sage, Hedda Sterne, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, 
Tanning, and Pegeen Vail, among others. Devastated by Max's 
involvement with Tanning, Peggy had to concede that her 
unhappy life with him was at an end. They separated and 
divorced soon afterward. 

The opening for the next exhibition, Retrospective Exhibition 
of the Works ofHelion (February 8-March 13), was a benefit for 
Fighting French Relief. Jean Helion first met Pegeen at this 
time, and they would marry in 1944. A group exhibition entitled 
15 Early 15 Late Paintings (March 13-April 17) was conceived 
by Jimmy Ernst; it paired an early and a late painting by 
fifteen European painters, such as Georges Braque, Salvador 
Dali, Vasily Kandinsky, Fernand Leger, Joan Miro, and Piet 
Mondrian. At roughly the same time as her separation from 
Max and a rift with Breton, Peggy began to distance herself 
from the French Surrealists and increased her involvement with 
young American artists. In Exhibition of Collage (April 16- 
May 15), the first international exhibition of collage held in the 
United States, such established European artists as Braque, 
George Grosz, then living in New York, Pablo Picasso, and Kurt 
Schwitters were shown alongside such American artists as 
William Baziotes, Cornell, David Hare, Robert Motherwell, 
Pereira, Jackson Pollock (his name misspelled on the announce-

ment as "Polloch"), Ad Reinhardt, and Sterne; works by Jimmy 
Ernst and Laurence Vail were also included. Motherwell and 
Pollock were uneasy about collage but very much wanted to be 
in the exhibition; Motherwell remembers that Pollock "had no 
particular feel for collage, but I remember being surprised at the 
violence on his attack of the material." 84 

Pollock— who coincidentally was working as a custodian at 
the Museum of Non-Objective Painting— Baziotes, Jimmy Ernst, 
Motherwell, Pereira, Reinhardt, and Sterne also appeared in the 
subsequent Spring Salon for Young Artists (May 18- June 26), 
as did such artists as Morris Graves, Matta, and Gordon 
Onslow-Ford. This exhibition was a unique opportunity to see 
the newest American art; most New York galleries showed the 
work of European artists. The jury consisted of Barr, Duchamp, 
Mondrian, Putzel, Soby, Sweeney, and Peggy, with Breton and 
Max Ernst conspicuously absent. To Peggy's surprise, Mondrian 
was especially taken by the work of Pollock, whom he thought 
was the most exciting painter he had seen for a very long time. 
Reviews were good, and Greenberg wrote in The Nation, "there 
is a large painting [Stenographic Figure, 1942, now in the 
collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York] by Jackson 
Pollock, which, I am told, made the jury starry-eyed." 85 At the 
urging of Matta and Putzel, Peggy took the unusual, almost 
unique, step of signing a contract with the young artist, under 
the terms of which he would receive a monthly stipend. The 
contract would be renewed annually, and Peggy continued to 
pay a stipend through February 1948.

After opening the second season of Art of This Century by 
presenting the loan exhibition Masterworks of Early de Chirico 
(October 5-November 7), which was based on Soby's 1941 
book The Early de Chirico, Peggy gave Pollock his first solo 
exhibition (November 9-27). The preface to Pollock's catalogue 
was written by Sweeney, and Peggy considered Pollock to be 
the "spiritual offspring" of Sweeney and herself. 86 Reviews 
by Robert Coates in The New Yorker and Clement Greenberg in 
The Nation were full of praise. In Partisan Review, Motherwell 
wrote that Pollock "represents one of the younger generation's 
chances. There are not three other young Americans of whom 
this could be said." 87 At the instigation of Sweeney, the Museum 
of Modern Art put a reserve on She- Wolf (1943), but Barr, 
who disliked Pollock's work, was resistant to purchasing it. A 
reproduction of the painting appeared in the April 1944 issue of 
Harpers Bazaar, accompanying an article by Sweeney entitled 
"Five American Painters," and in May the Museum of Modern 
Art finally approved the purchase, making it Pollock's first 
work to be acquired by a museum. Over the years, several of 
Pollock's paintings were sold, but never for more than a thou- 
sand dollars each. Peggy eventually gave away well over a 
dozen of his paintings, much to her later distress, not realizing 
how important he would become in the history of American 
and Western painting. 

In her personal life, Peggy had found solace in the friendship 
of Kenneth Macpherson, a wealthy patron of the arts, who was 
then married to the poet Bryher (Winifred Ellerman). (Bryher 
had previously been married to Robert McAlmon, one of Peggy's 
early Paris friends, and was involved in an ongoing relationship 
with the poet H. D. [Hilda Doolittle].) Macpherson met Peggy 
through Max, and in the aftermath of the couple's separation, 
they became close friends. Agreeing to an unconventional domes- 



64 



tic arrangement, Peggy and Macpherson moved into a duplex 
apartment in a brownstone at 155 East Sixty-first Street; in 
effect, they were able to have separate apartments on each floor. 

Macpherson advised Peggy on how to dress and make herself 
up nicely, and gave her financial guidance. Peggy had never 
been conventionally elegant; the artist Nell Blaine would recall 
that she was like a "sexy witch." 88 Jean Connolly, who had been 
married to the writer Cyril Connolly and would marry Laurence 
Vail in 1946, stayed at the duplex, where she "often shared a 
bed with her hostess." 89 Clearly, although Macpherson was 
a calming presence, Peggy's personal life was not much less con- 
fused than during her prior relationships. 

Pollock was commissioned to paint Mural (December 1943, 
now in the collection of the Museum of Art, University of Iowa, 
Iowa City), his largest work, for the duplex. In 1945, Andre 
Kertesz, who admired Peggy, would photograph her in her sit- 
ting room with Paul Delvaux's The Break of Day (L'Aurore, July 
1937) in the background, and her earrings hanging on the walls. 
The duplex, like Hale House before it, became an important 
gathering place for members of New York's cultural world. 

The 1943-44 season at Art of This Century continued with 
Natural, Insane, Surrealist Art (December 1-31); "natural" 
referred to "driftwood, petrified tree roots, bones and skele- 
tons," 90 which were shown along with drawings by the insane 
and a selection of Surrealist works by European and American 
artists. The second season continued into 1944 with solo 
exhibitions devoted to Pereira (January 4-22), Jean Arp 
(January 24-February 29), and— at the suggestion of Pollock 
and Lee Krasner— the first solo exhibition of Hans Hofmann 
(March 7-31). Helion, Morris Hirshfield, Matta, Motherwell, 
Pollock, and Mark Rothko were among the diverse artists 
represented in First Exhibition in America of Twenty Paintings 
(April 11-30). The second Spring Salon for Young Artists 
(May 2- June 3) was juried by Barr, Duchamp, Macpherson, 
Putzel, Soby, Sweeney, and Peggy; Baziotes, Jimmy Ernst, 
Hare, Pereira, Pollock, Richard Pousette-Dart, and Sterne were 
among those exhibiting works. The season closed with The Negro 
in American Life (May 29-June 3), a photographic exhibition 
organized by John Becker with the Council Against Intolerance 
in America. This exhibition was such a success that a book of 
the same title was published later that year. 

The third season started off with a succession of solo 
exhibitions of works by Baziotes (October 3-21), Motherwell

(October 24-November 11), and Hare (November 14-December 2). 
These were Baziotes's and Hare's first solo exhibitions and 
Motherwell's first solo exhibition in the United States. Peggy 
had become friends with Jane and Paul Bowles, and in October 
she financed a recording of Paul Bowles's music under the label 
Art of This Century Recordings. The record cover was designed 
by Max Ernst, and only 100 copies were printed. The A-side 
was an early Sonata for Flute and Piano played by Rene Le Roy 
and George Reeves; the B-side was "Two Mexican Dances" 
played by the piano duo Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale. 

Barr and Sweeney were now her mentors; their roles in 
Peggy's life were roughly similar to the one previously played by 
Herbert Read. She also found Putzel, who had succeeded Jimmy 
Ernst as her assistant, to be indispensable in steering her to 
new discoveries. In fact, it was Putzel who proselytized for many 
of the artists— including the sculptor Hare and such then 
obscure painters as Baziotes, Hofmann, Pollock, Rothko, and 
Still— who were given their first solo exhibitions at Art of This 
Century. In the fall of 1944, Putzel— who had stopped working 
for Peggy after Hofmann's exhibition— opened his 67 Gallery, 
also on Fifty-seventh Street, where he exhibited contemporary 
American artists. The gallery's first season would be its last, as 
Putzel died of a heart attack during the summer of 1945. 

The 1944-45 season at Art of This Century continued with 
simultaneous exhibitions of constructions by Isabelle Waldberg 
and paintings by Rudolph Ray (December 12- January 6). 
There followed solo exhibitions for the artists Mark Rothko 
(January 9- February 4), his first individual showing; Laurence 
Vail (February 10-March 16), again exhibiting collage bottles; 
Alberto Giacometti (February 10-March 16); Pollock (March 19- 
April 14); Wolfgang Paalen (April 17-May 12); and Alice Rahon 
Paalen (May 15- June 7). Pollock's second solo exhibition includ- 
ed open hours for viewing Mural at Peggy's duplex on Sixty- 
first Street. Greenberg wrote that the exhibition "establishes 
him, in my opinion, as the strongest painter of his generation 
and perhaps the greatest one to appear since Miro." 91 The season 
ended with The Women (June 12- July 7), the gallery's second 
group exhibition dedicated to women artists; it included many of 
the artists shown in 1943 as well as Louise Bourgeois and Janet 
Sobel— "the best woman painter by far in America," according 
to Peggy 92 — Sterne, and Charmion von Wiegand. 

The fourth season at Art of This Century opened with 
Autumn Salon (October 6-29), which included many artists

previously exhibited at the gallery as well as such newcomers 
as Willem de Kooning and Clyfford Still. Solo exhibitions by 
Charles Seliger (October 30-November 17), a friend of Jimmy 
Ernst; Paul Wilton (October 30-November 17); Lee Hersch 
(November 20-December 8); and Ted Bradley (November 20- 
December 8) were followed by Christmas Exhibition of Gouaches 
(December 11-29), which included a work by Arshile Gorky. 
Gorky's participation was surprisingly the only time he was 
shown at the gallery, although sometime around 1945 Peggy 
bought one of his mature paintings, Untitled (summer 1944), for 
her collection. The remainder of the season was devoted to solo 
exhibitions: Sobel (January 3-19, 1946), Hare (January 22- 
February 9), Still (February 12-March 7), Pamela Bodin 
(February 12-March 7), Pegeen Vail (March 9-30), Peter Busa 
(March 9-30), Pollock (April 2-20), Teresa Zarnower (April 23- 
May 11), Robert De Niro (April 23-May 11), and Sonja Sekula 
(May 14- June 1). Still's exhibition, his first individual showing, 
had been proposed by Rothko, who wrote the catalogue preface, 
and installed by Greenberg and David Porter. Peggy occasionally 
bought works that were in the exhibitions, and she purchased 
Still's Jamais (May 1944). He would later write, "Peggy was 
the only one doing an honest job at this time. She was doing 
something personal. The closing of her gallery [after the 1946-47 
season] was the biggest loss to the art world." 93 De Niro (the 
father of the actor Robert De Niro) was praised by Greenberg for 
the abstractions in his first solo exhibition. Reviewing Pollock's 
third solo exhibition, Greenberg wrote that the artist's "superior- 
ity to his contemporaries in this country lies in his ability to 
create a genuinely violent and extravagant art without losing 
stylistic control." 94 

In March, the publication of Peggy's memoirs Out of This 
Century: The Informal Memoirs of Peggy Guggenheim— the title 
a play on the gallery's name — coincided with Pegeen's first solo 
exhibition. Max Ernst had provided art for the front of the dust 
jacket, and Pollock had done so for the back. In discussing 
certain relationships, Peggy amusingly used fictitious names, for 
example, "Florenz Dale" for Laurence Vail and "Oblomov" for 
Samuel Beckett. She spared no details in discussing her sexual 
affairs or the treatment she received during her marriage 
to Max, whom she referred to by name. The book received many 
reviews, mostly harsh, by such critics as Katharine Kuh, who 
called the memoirs a "vulgar autobiography" that was "doubly 
offensive" because of Peggy's "discriminating collection." 95 



68 



Herbert Read, however, upon receiving a copy from Peggy, 
promptly wrote to her: 

You have probably concluded that I am "mortally offended" 
by the book, + am never going to speak to you again. 
Not a bit! . . . You have outrivalled Rousseau + Casanova, 
so who am I to criticize "Out of this Century"? I found it 
quite fascinating as an historical document— and it is only 
the lack of introspection + self-analysis which prevents it 
from being a human, psychological document (masterpiece?) 
like "Nightwood." That is why it is nearer to Casanova 
than to Rousseau— you are destined to be called the Female 
Casanova! It is perhaps even more amoral than even 
Casanova, who, if my memory is not deceiving me, has 
some snivelling moments of self-disgust, or self-pity. 96 

Writing in a rather matter-of-fact fashion, like a reporter just 
telling the facts, Peggy showed enthusiasm, without being really 
passionate. She did not want or was unable to completely reveal 
herself, being perhaps too emotionally vulnerable. In 1960, an 
edition— Confessions of an Art Addict— was published for which 
Peggy condensed her original memoirs, added new material, and 
used all real names except for "Llewellyn." In a letter to Peggy, 
Djuna Barnes wrote: "For myself I find it somewhat changed 
from the first as you are somewhat changed from those days. 
Just what was your purpose in re-writing it?" 97 In 1979, Peggy 
herself wrote in the third, final version— Out of This Century: 
Confessions of an Art Addict— "I seem to have written the first 
book as an uninhibited woman and the second one as a lady who 
was trying to establish her place in the history of modern art." 98 

World War II ended in Europe in May 1945 and in Asia that 
August. With the war over, Peggy decided she badly wanted 
to go back to Europe. Much as she loved Art of This Century, she 
loved Europe more. By the summer of 1946, Peggy, having decid- 
ed against living in London, went first to Paris, where Sindbad 
and Pegeen had settled. There, Peggy ran into the writer Mary 
McCarthy, an old friend, and her husband, Bowden Broadwater, 
who were on their way to Venice. They encouraged Peggy to 
accompany them, and she was glad to leave Paris, where she 
now felt like a stranger. She would write: 

On my way there, I decided Venice would be my future home. 
I had always loved it more than any place on earth and felt 



70 



I would be happy alone there. I set about trying to find a 
palace that would house my collection and provide a garden 
for my dogs. This was to take several years; in the meantime 
I had to go back to New York to close the gallery." 

McCarthy's time with Peggy in Italy is vividly related in her 
story 'The Cicerone," in which Peggy is fictionalized as "Polly 
Herkimer Grabbe," who is looking for a palazzo in Venice and 
to whom "men were a continental commodity of which one natu- 
rally took advantage, along with the wine and the olives, the 
bitter coffee and the crusty bread." 100 

Back in New York, Peggy made it clear that Art of This 
Century's 1946-47 season would be its last. The only group exhi- 
bition of this fifth and final season presented work by Seliger, 
Kenneth Scott (later a fashion designer), Dwight Ripley, John 
Goodwin, and David Hill (December 3-21). Otherwise the season 
consisted entirely of solo exhibitions: Hans Richter (October 22- 
November 9); Rudi Blesh (November 12-30); Virginia Admiral 
(November 12-30); Marjorie McKee (December 24- January 11); 
Helen Sch winger (December 24— January 11); Pollock (January 14— 
February 7); Hirshfield (February 1-March 1), a memorial exhi- 
bition of his last paintings; Pousette-Dart (March 4-22); Hare 
(March 25-April 19); and Theo van Doesburg (April 29-May 31), 
his first American retrospective. 

Richter 's exhibition consisted of an "orchestration of organic 
and inorganic forms," 101 which included stills for his color film 
Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947). Under the auspices of Art

of This Century Productions, Peggy provided most of the financ- 
ing for the film although only Macpherson's name appears in 
the credits as coproducer. Probably the first feature-length 
avant-garde film produced in America, it contained seven dream 
sequences on which Ernst, Leger, Man Ray, Duchamp, Calder 
(two dreams), and Richter collaborated; Paul Bowles, John Cage, 
and Darius Milhaud were among the composers contributing 
to the score. 

Pollock's fourth solo exhibition again confirmed Peggy's pre- 
science in giving financial support to the artist. Pollock exhibited 
paintings from two series, Sounds in the Grass and Accabonac 
Creek, and Greenberg thought the exhibition "signals what may 
be a major step in his development. . . . Pollock has gone beyond 
the stage where he needs to make his poetry explicit in ideo- 
graphs. What he invents instead has perhaps, in its very 
abstractness and absence of assignable definition, a more rever- 
berating meaning. . . . Pollock points a way beyond the easel." 102 
Nonetheless, Pollock's work did not sell well, and few dealers 
were ready to represent him. Peggy finally succeeded in placing 
Pollock with Betty Parsons, who would first exhibit his work at 
her gallery in January 1948; Peggy herself paid Pollock the 
stipend due under his contract through February. After the van 
Doesburg exhibition, which had been arranged by Nelly van 
Doesburg, Peggy closed and completely dismantled the gallery. 
She sold Kiesler's furniture to the Museum of Modern Art and 
individually to people who dropped by, such as Sidney Janis. 
Seliger sold Kiesler's curved walls to the Franklin Simon depart- 
ment store, where he was working at the time. Peggy was eager 
to return to Italy. 

In his review of the van Doesburg exhibition in The Nation, 
Greenberg honored Peggy: 



Her departure is in my opinion a serious loss to living 
American art. The erratic gaiety with which Miss 
Guggenheim promoted "non-realistic" art may have misled 
some people, as perhaps her autobiography did too, but 
the fact remains that in the three or four years of her career 
as a New York gallery director she gave first showings to 
more serious new artists than anyone else in the country. . . . 
I am convinced that Peggy Guggenheim's place in the history 
of American art will grow larger as time passes and as the 
artists she encouraged mature. 103

During the summer of 1947, Peggy went to Venice and found 
temporary quarters in the hotel Savoia e Jolanda on the Riva 
degli Schiavoni. She set about exploring and rediscovering 
La Serenissima (literally meaning "the most serene," this was an 
historic name for the Republic of Venice). Thanks to the propri- 
etor of the Cafe Angelo near the Rialto bridge, she went to the 
restaurant All'Angelo just off the piazza San Marco in search of 
the artist Emilio Vedova. All'Angelo was known as "il ritrovo 
degli artisti" (the artists' hangout), and here she met Vedova and 
Giuseppe Santomaso, both of whom had heard of Peggy as well 
as of her uncle Solomon's Museum of Non-Objective Painting in 
New York. In a mixture of English, French, and Italian, Peggy 
spoke to the two abstract artists — both founding members of the 
Fronte Nuovo delle Arti — spending many happy hours convers- 
ing about art and her future in Venice. Santomaso was particu- 
larly interested in the problems of rendering color and light — 
suggested by the mosaics of the neighborhood of San Marco and 
the island of Torcello, and by the lagoon, canals, and familiar 
sites of his native Venice. 

In November, Peggy accompanied Jean Connolly and 
Laurence Vail to Capri. By spring 1948, she was back in Venice, 
where she rented an apartment in the Palazzo Barbaro, across 
from the Accademia on the Grand Canal; Henry James had lived 
in this palazzo during the writing of The Wings of the Dove 
(1902). Because she had not yet found a permanent home for 
either herself (and her dogs) or her collection, Santomaso sug- 
gested to Rodolfo Pallucchini, secretary-general of the Venice 



74 



Biennale, that Peggy's collection should be exhibited. Greece was 
embroiled in civil war, and the Greek government agreed that 
its pavilion — which would otherwise have been vacant — could be 
used to exhibit Peggy's collection. The pavilion was soon hand- 
somely refurbished by the architect Carlo Scarpa. Although the 
Biennale had been founded in 1895, it was really not until 1948, 
the year of the first Biennale since 1942, that Venice began to 
play an international role in Modern and contemporary art. The 
1948 Biennale (June 6-September 30) featured a prestigious pre- 
sentation of Impressionist paintings curated by the art historian 
Roberto Longhi and a retrospective of Pablo Picasso paintings 
from 1907 to 1942. Restitution of a kind was made by the exhibi- 
tion in the central pavilion of works by Otto Dix, Karl Hofer, 
and Max Pechstein, whose art had been labeled "degenerate" by 
the Nazis. Among the foreign pavilions, the American exhibition 
of a diverse group of seventy-nine artists, each represented by

a single work, included Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Marsden 
Hartley, John Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, Maurice Prendergast, 
and Max Weber. 

Collezione Peggy Guggenheim was a defining event of the 
Biennale. Peggy's collection was the most comprehensive 
survey of abstract and Surrealist art yet seen in Italy, and such 
American artists as William Baziotes, Jackson Pollock, Mark 
Rothko, and Clyfford Still were for the first time being shown 
outside the United States. Peggy's collection gave Europeans the 
opportunity to catch up with the best avant-garde art of the 
recent past and to be introduced to the New York painters who 
would come to dominate the art scene of the 1950s. Although 
Peggy's collection was featured in the Biennale's catalogue, she 
also published a small catalogue to sell in the pavilion. 

Peggy would later write, "My exhibition had enormous 
publicity and the pavilion was one of the most popular of the 
Biennale. . . . what I enjoyed most was seeing the name 
Guggenheim appearing on the maps in the Public Gardens next 
to the names of Great Britain, France, Holland. ... I felt as 
though I were a new European country." 104 Peggy was honored 
with visits from Luigi Einaudi, the president of Italy, and James 
Dunn, the American ambassador to Italy. Another distinguished 
visitor was the elderly art historian Bernard Berenson, who 
disliked Modern art (perhaps his visit was suggested by Peggy's 
friend Elsa Schiaparelli, who was his son's mother-in-law). A 
defensive Peggy, who had read and admired Berenson's books, 
told him, "I couldn't afford old masters, and anyhow I consider it 
one's duty to protect the art of one's time." 105 To which Berenson 
retorted, "You should have come to me, my dear, I would have 
found you bargains." 106 Significantly, he liked Pollock's paintings, 
which "to him, were like tapestries." 107 A photograph by Lee 
Miller charmingly captured an ecstatic Peggy being visited 
in her pavilion by art critic Lionello Venturi. In British Vogue, 
Miller described Peggy's pavilion as the "most sensational" of 
all. 108 Peggy's Biennale experience was marred by a few 
incidents: a small sculpture by David Hare was stolen, and 
Pallucchini decided to remove a drawing by Matta, which 
he found too sexually explicit. And the intense publicity generat- 
ed by her participation in the Biennale resulted in her being 
incessantly pursued: "I was plagued by everyone wanting to 
sell me something." 109 She hired Vittorio Carrain, one of the 
owners of All'Angelo, to assist her, and he became her part-time 
secretary. 



76 



The 1948 Biennale was a boost to the cultural life of Venice, 
and to Italy in general. During the next twenty years— besides 
the subsequent editions of the Biennale— a profusion of events 
took place in Venice: Happenings, performances, and exhibitions 
were organized by such curators and critics as Michel Tapie; 
exhibitions were held in such galleries as II Cavallino, II Canale, 
Paolo Barozzi, and II Leone; architectural conferences featured 
Louis Kahn, Le Corbusier, Carlo Scarpa, and Frank Lloyd 
Wright; fashion events were presented at Palazzo Grassi; and 
the city's musical life thrived with the presence of composers 
Bruno Maderna, Gianfrancesco Malipiero, Luigi Nono, and 
Goffredo Petrassi, as well as with the regular concert appear- 
ances of Leonard Bernstein, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Igor 
Stravinsky. As Carrain colorfully described it, "The 1948 
Biennale was like opening a bottle of Champagne. It was the 
explosion of modern art after the Nazis had tried to kill it." 110 

Palazzo Venier dei Leoni 

In December 1948, Peggy bought the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, 
an unfinished palazzo on the Grand Canal, between the Basilica 
of Santa Maria della Salute and the Accademia. It was designed 
by the Venetian architect Lorenzo Boschetti for the Veniers, 
an aristocratic Venetian family. Begun in 1749, only the palaz- 
zo's basement and ground floor were completed. Long and wide, 
it is often mistaken for a modern building and has one of the 
largest gardens in Venice. The word "Leoni" was added to the 
palazzo's name because stone lion heads were incorporated into 
the base of the facade, and because legend had it that in the 
eighteenth century a lion was kept in the garden. Interestingly, 
two celebrated women resided in the palazzo before Peggy: 
Marchesa Luisa Casati, muse of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, 
in the 1910s and 1920s, and Doris Viscountess Castlerosse in 
the late 1930s. The palazzo had become rather derelict by the 
time the Viscountess acquired it, and she installed marble bath- 
rooms and mosaic floors. Peggy made further improvements 
to the house and garden, where she placed a stone "throne" on 
which she liked to pose for photographers. Her bedroom, painted 
turquoise, overlooked the Grand Canal. Over the years, she 
would hang exotic earrings along both sides of Alexander 
Calder's Silver Bedhead (winter 1945-46), which she had com- 
missioned in New York. Beside Venetian mirrors, she would 
hang Franz von Lenbach's portraits and Francis Bacon's Study

for Chimpanzee (March 1957). She would display a selection of 
Laurence Vail's collage bottles; elsewhere in the palazzo, she 
kept his Screen (1940). The bedroom became her private retreat 
in the years to come when visitors strolled through the galleries 
in which her collection came to be installed. Or she would take 
refuge by sunbathing on the roof terrace during the summer 
months. This wing of the palazzo also contained several guest 
bedrooms, and the other wing had the living and dining rooms 
as well as the kitchen. 

Peggy's collection had been brought into Italy on a temporary 
permit for exhibition at the Biennale. To avoid high import 
duties she would have to send the collection out of the country 
and then bring it back in at a lower valuation. Until such an 
arrangement could be made, she needed to keep the collection 
traveling within Italy to other exhibition venues in order to 
avoid being penalized by the Italian government. After she 
moved into the palazzo in 1949, her collection was shown in the 
vaulted cellar of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence during February 
and March. The Palazzo Strozzi also published a catalogue. 



78 



In May 1949, Peggy decided to keep guest books. Handmade 
and leather bound, they are personalized with her initials, P. G., 
on the cover of the first book and her first name, PEGGY, on the 
covers of the remaining four. Leafing through them is to experi- 
ence Peggy's life in Venice through the friends, art-world col- 
leagues, and admirers who came to the palazzo— some stopped 
by for drinks, a meal, or a party, others as overnight guests. Her 
son, Sindbad, and his family inherited the guest books, among 
other memorabilia, after Peggy died in 1979. My mother, Peggy 
Angela Vail — who had married Sindbad in 1957— admired and 
had grown increasingly fonder of her mother-in-law over the 
years, even though the relationship between them had not 
always been easy. Peggy Angela was so intrigued by Peggy that 
she wished to edit and publish a selection of the best entries 
from the guest books. Sindbad— who had many misgivings about 
his family— was not overly enthusiastic about the idea but acqui- 
esced when he better understood his wife's serious intentions. 
In Paris, she laboriously began to decipher signatures (many 
remain unidentified) and started making notes of impressions 
and reminiscences of Peggy and the Guggenheim-Vail family. 
She also discovered the previously unknown drawings sketched 
on pages of the guest books. Tragically, in May 1986, after many 
years of illness, Sindbad died of cancer. Peggy Angela had also 
contracted cancer, and two years later to the day, she passed 
away My mother's project came to a halt, and my sister and I

inherited the guest books. I came across a pile of notes and 
papers relating to the books, and I decided to pursue the project 
in memory of my mother. When I later moved to New York, the 
idea of a publication and an exhibition that would encompass 
the many achievements of my grandmother, Peggy, sprang to 
mind. Within this larger project, excerpts and drawings from the 
guest books are published here for the first time. 

Not only did Peggy acquire works of art, she also assembled 
guests and amassed a startling collection of their signatures, 
drawings, sketches, comments, reminiscences, poems, and musi- 
cal bars in her guest books. Peggy took pride in these books and 
insisted that her guests write in them, "and if they are poets 
or artists they may add a poem or a drawing, which is more than 
welcome." 111 Although many of the artists who visited Peggy are 
represented in her collection, many others— who perhaps visited 
in the hope that she might acquire their work— are not. 

The diversity of entries in the guest books makes them 
unique. Among others are Stella Adler, Afro, Hardy Amies, Karel 
Appel, Dore Ashton, Clive Bell, Isaiah Berlin, Louise Bourgeois, 
Marlon Brando, Art Buchwald, Bernard Buffet, Elliott Carter, 
Dale Chihuly, Randolph Churchill, Diana Cooper, Ian Fleming, 
Renato Guttuso, Patricia Highsmith, Hedda Hopper, Dominique 
de Menil, Eugenio Montale, Henry Moore, Gabriele Miinter, 
Gordon Onslow-Ford, William and Babe Paley, George Plimpton, 
Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., Jerome Robbins, Harold Rosenberg, 
Anthony Armstrong-Jones (later Lord Snowdon), Karlheinz 
Stockhausen, Maria Talchieff, Virgil Thomson, Tennessee 
Williams, and Angus Wilson — all visited Peggy, leaving their 
names, and sometimes more, in the books. All levels of society 
are represented, from the builders of Peggy's barchessa in 
the garden to European aristocracy. (The Venetian aristocracy, 
however, did not readily accept Peggy within their community 
and were not intimate with her until the 1970s.) In addition 
to the aristocracy, Peggy enjoyed other traditional members of 
society, such as the officers of the United States Navy for whom 
she gave numerous parties over many years when they came 
through Venice. 

The Anglo-American community in particular flocked to 
Peggy's, in the same way that they flocked to Harry's Bar, diago- 
nally opposite her palazzo, on the other side of the Grand Canal. 
In January 1958, Al Hirschfeld would wittily depict the famous 
bar with Peggy in full regalia showing off her Calder earrings 
and heartily biting into a sandwich.

During Peggy's thirty years in the palazzo. and especially 
during the glamorous 1950s, one could meet all kinds of people 
there. The palazzo. and consequently the guest books in which so 
many mementos of distinguished visitors were left, symbolize 
Peggy's canonization as ait patron and collector. She was a liv- 
ing legend, and her home was a cultural landmark. Visitors 
streamed through the palazzo mostly during the warmer months 
of spring and summer, and their numbers increased during the 
years in which a Biennale was held. 

Some houseguests stayed for several weeks at a time, keep- 
ing Peggy and her many dogs company. The prevalence of the 
dog theme in the guest books might bewilder those who did not 
know Peggy, but her dogs were probably what she loved most. 
The dogs were loving and undemanding, and they truly filled an 
emotional gap in her life. Peggy delighted in naming her dogs, 
her "darling babies." as she liked to call them: Baby. Cappuccino. 
Emily. Foglia. Hong Kong. Madam Butterfly. Peacock. Sable. 
Toro. White Angel, and even Pegeen I after her daughter' and Sir 
Herbert I a homage to Herbert Read long before he was knighted . 

The photographer Roloff Beny. who lived in Rome, was the 
first to write in the first guest book on May 4. 1949. Among 
the subsequent entries, a few weeks later. Laurence Vail wrote 
a few lines in verse. On the next page. Giuseppe Santomaso — 
a regular visitor and a neighbor who lived a few bridges away 
in a beautiful apartment overlooking the Grand Canal, near the 
Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute — was the first Venetian 
painter to sign the book, but he never left a sketch. 

During June and July. Peggy's collection was shown in 
Milan's Palazzo Reale for an exhibition to benefit the 
Ass&lt; ciazione Artisti dTtalia. It was so successful that the cata- 
logue had to be reprinted. Back in Venice again. Peggy's collec- 
tion was housed in the Galleria Internazionale d'Arte Moderna 
di Ca' Pesaro. for the Italian authorities would not allow her 
to take permanent possession of it. Pending the resolution of 
import duties, the collection remained officially in the custody 
of the government. 

In July. Marino Marini made the first of several visits to the 
Palazzo Venier dei Leoni and made sketches of his trademark 
horses in the guest book. That month. Isamu Noguchi was 
among the visitors. Sindbad. referring to himself in the book as 
"an editor left high and dry."- 1 - also visited that summer: in 
February, he had begun a publishing venture in Paris, a bilin- 
gual literary magazine called Points, dedicated to emerging

British, American, Irish, and French writers. The collectors 
Bernard and Becky Reis, Peggy's friends from New York, became 
regular guests. Saul Steinberg and Hedda Sterne's first visit was 
commemorated by Sterne's sketch in the guest book of Pecora, 
the latest arrival among Peggy's shaggy Lhasa apsos. 

With Peggy's collection still under formal control of the 
Italian government, she succeeded in "borrowing" some pieces 
for a sculpture exhibition held during September and October in 
the palazzo's garden and terrace on the Grand Canal. Sculptures 
by Pietro Consagra, Mirko (Mirko Basaldella), Salvatore 
Messina, and Alberto Viani were lent directly by the artists, and 
a catalogue was published for the occasion. A few plaster pieces 
were displayed in the palazzo. Among the works exhibited was 
Marini's The Angel of the City (1948, cast 1950?), which repre- 
sents a man, with an erect phallus, riding a horse. Peggy had 
bought the sculpture as a plaster original, and it was included in 
the exhibition at the Palazzo Reale in Milan. At some point, 
Peggy returned the sculpture to Marini to be cast in bronze, at 
which time he made a separate phallus, "so that it could be 
screwed in and out at leisure." 113 Peggy could remove it to avoid 
embarrassing conservative visitors, although she would more 
often than not forget to do so. After the phallus was stolen, 
Marini welded a new one to the sculpture, which had been 
provocatively placed on the upper terrace on the Grand Canal 
across from the police headquarters of the Prefettura. 

In September, such longtime friends as Nelly van Doesburg 
and Mary Reynolds arrived to see Peggy. The guest book later

that month includes entries by Leonor Fini, who drew a witty 
reference to her painting in Peggy's collection, The Shepherdess 
of the Sphinxes (1941), and Nancy Cunard, who merely signed. 
Charles Henri Ford wrote glowingly of Venice: 

Water, my element, makes a dream of air. 
Venice, gold phoenix, rises from fire, 
Her veins of sunset never know night. 
Narcissus of cities — hold tight, hold tight! 114 

His companion, Pavel Tchelitchew, sketched one of his typical 
spiral-like heads. Pegeen also left a drawing in the guest book 
during this busy month. 

The art historian Sam Hunter, who had met Peggy at the 
closing of Art of This Century in New York and was then in 
Venice writing for the New York Herald Tribune, stopped by in 
October. Peggy was upset that he named her "Pollock's first 
dealer," 115 as she felt inadequately described; indeed, he remem- 
bers her as a prophet whose contribution to the history of 
American art was immense. 116 

In November, Alberto Viani signed his name in the guest 
book, as did Antoine Pevsner, who also wrote a grateful message. 
A few days later, Alberto Giacometti and his wife, Annette, 
spent a belated honeymoon in the palazzo. Giacometti drew a 
hasty pencil sketch — the only drawing of his that Peggy ever 
owned — and wrote in his typically modest fashion: "II n'y a 
aucun moyen de mettre ce dessin en place ce soir. Nous partons 
demain matin. Les journees sont passees trop vite ici ou je me 
sens tellement bien. Je voudrais y revenir, je remercie infmiment 
Peggy pour sa gentillesse." 117 (There is absolutely no way I can 
get this drawing right this evening. We are leaving tomorrow 
morning. The days have gone by too quickly here where I am 
feeling wonderful, I would like to come back, I thank Peggy so 
much for her kindness.) 



The 1950s 

The guest book entries, most limited to signatures and some- 
times short comments, proliferated in the 1950s; the books that 
cover these years reflect the intense social life at the Palazzo 
Venier dei Leoni during the period. The decade began with visits 
from Giuseppe Santomaso and Emilio Vedova. Kenneth 
Macpherson, soon a regular visitor, came in May. In the guest

book, Matta drew an amusing sketch of figures kissing one 
another's backsides. James Lord and his companion, Bernard 
Minoret, visited in June, just a few days before Mark Rothko — 
whose sketch in Peggy's book featured a gondola — and then 
Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. Curator Willem 
Sandberg came to see Peggy to arrange an exhibition of her col- 
lection at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. A welcome visit 
was paid by Wyn Henderson, her assistant at Guggenheim 
Jeune, whose guest book entry reflects the camaraderie Peggy 
enjoyed with old friends: "Darling Peggy — Unlike Catullus it 
was to Venice and not to Sirmio I came to 'nestle in the pillow of 
my dreams!' The loving blessings of a renewed and regenerated 
Wyn Henderson." 118 

In July and August, she showed her twenty-three Jackson 
Pollock works, of which two were promised gifts to Amsterdam's 
Stedelijk Museum, in a solo exhibition — his first in Europe — 
at the Sala Napoleonica of the Museo Correr in Venice. The suc- 
cess of this exhibition — which was organized with the collabora- 
tion of Le Tre Mani (Bruno Alfieri, Oreste Ferrari, and Giuseppe 
Marchiori) and Vittorio Carrain — delighted Peggy, who wrote,

"It seemed to place Pollock historically where he belonged as 
one of the greatest painters of our time." 119 She also organized 
Jean Helion's solo exhibition, held during August and 
September, at the Sala degli Specchi in the Palazzo Giustinian. 
In August, on facing pages of the guest book, Jean Arp left 
an organic sketch, and Graham Sutherland, visiting Peggy for 
the first time, drew a praying mantis. When Sutherland visited 
Peggy in the 1960s, he insisted that she return a painting of 
his that she had recently bought but which he considered inferi- 
or; he subsequently replaced it with Organic Form (1962-68). 
In September, Alfred Frankfurter, who had organized an exhibi- 
tion in the Biennale's American pavilion, which included three 
paintings by Pollock, was a guest as was Truman Capote, on the 
first of several visits. During this period, artist and stage 
designer Eugene Berman drew the first of his witty sketches of 
Peggy's dogs in the guest books; it shows a winged Lhasa 
apso perched on top of a tall Greek column, an allusion to the 
statue of a winged lion, symbol of Venice, that towers over 
the square between the Palazzo Ducale and piazza San Marco. 
On the same day in September, Gino Severini and Pietro

Consagra left ink drawings in the book. At the end of the month, 
John Rothenstein, director of the Tate Gallery, visited. 

Peggy lent Carlo Cardazzo several of her Pollock paintings 
for a solo exhibition at his Milan gallery, II Naviglio, during 
October and November. October brought Bruno Cagli and Marc 
Chagall, who drew an emblematic face in Peggy's guest book, to 
the palazzo. That month, Sandberg again visited Peggy in antici- 
pation of showing her collection in Amsterdam; the exhibition 
opened at the Stedelijk Museum in January 1951 and traveled 
to the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and then to the 
Kunsthaus Zurich. From Zurich, the collection was sent back to 
Italy. Peggy wrote, "It was all very easy. . . . they [the artworks] 
were brought in at four o'clock in the morning— an Alpine pass. 
These very stupid, sleepy douaniers, who didn't know what 
it was all about, let them come in for I think $1000. " 120 In this 
manner, Peggy was finally able to permanently move her 
collection into the palazzo. 

In 1951, Peggy's collection was installed throughout the 
palazzo; the courtyard became a sculpture garden. From the 
spring into the fall, the collection could be seen, free of charge, 
by the public on three afternoons a week. The architectural 
firm bbpr (Lodovico Barbiano di Belgiojoso, Enrico Peressutti, 
and Ernesto Nathan Rogers) presented a plan for the restoration 
of her palazzo and additional exhibition space, conceiving, 
according to Peggy, "a two-story gallery elevated from my roof 
on pillars twenty feet high. The front was to resemble the Doge's 
Palace, and in their minds they [bbpr] conceived something that 
they thought would be a link between the past and the 
present." 121 Peggy disliked the design and decided against it. In 
the early 1950s, with the help of Matta, Peggy turned the base- 
ment rooms into galleries. 

Ken Scott, who had exhibited as a painter (Kenneth Scott) at 
Art of This Century and was now a fashion designer, visited 
in early spring, as did W. Somerset Maugham, who wrote in 
the guest book to acknowledge a "perfect dry Martini." 122 Saul 
Steinberg and Hedda Sterne were back in May. In June, 
Philip Johnson wrote that Peggy's palazzo was "the only place 
I would trade for the Glass House," 123 his New Canaan, 
Connecticut, home. The English aesthete and writer Harold 
Acton— whose own home, Villa La Pietra, in Florence was anoth- 
er famous Anglo-American gathering place— was "intoxicated 
by the achievements of mine hostess," 124 alluding not only to her 
artistic accomplishments but also to her sexual ones, perhaps 



92 



envying her for her many male conquests. In September, 
Stephen Spender, who would visit regularly, was one of many 
guests. Wifredo Lam drew a small dragon in the guest book 
in December, and an appreciative Nelly van Doesburg filled 
a whole page, dated November-December, effusively thanking 
Peggy for her loving care while van Doesburg was sick. In 
August, Peggy had met Raoul Gregorich, twenty-three years 
her junior. A good companion, uncomplicated, and quite uninter- 
ested in and ignorant about art, he became a frequent guest 
and was Peggy's last great love. 

Peggy's second guest book begins in late December 1951 
with a colorful watercolor by Roloff Beny. In early 1952, 
on the recommendation of William Congdon, Peggy became 
the patron of Tancredi (Parmeggiani Tancredi), a young artist 
living in Venice. Tancredi soon began an affair with Peggy's 
daughter, Pegeen, who would remain married to Jean Helion 
until 1958. Peggy gave Tancredi— an adherent of the artists' 
group Movimento Spaziale, which had been founded by Lucio 
Fontana— use of a basement studio in the palazzo as well as 
a stipend until 1955. Eleven Tancredi works acquired by Peggy 
remain in the collection. Over the years, her support of Italian 
artists included the purchase of works by Edmondo Bacci, 
Consagra, Piero Dorazio, Mirko, Santomaso, and Vedova, 
among many others. Although she focused on buying Italian 
art, she also bought works by artists as diverse as Pierre 
Alechinsky, Francis Bacon, Congdon, Alan Davie, Willem de 
Kooning, Jean Dubuffet, and Mark Tobey. 

June 1952 brought the Biennale, and with it many friends, 
such as Elsa Schiaparelli and Herbert Read, who wrote in 
the guest book, quoting T. S. Eliot's The Family Reunion, 
"You and I / My dear, may very likely meet again / In our wan- 
derings in the neutral territory / Between two worlds." 125 Read 
would visit regularly through the years during the Biennale 
season. At this time, he and Alfred H. Barr, Jr., stayed at the 
palazzo for a few weeks. A drawing by Friedensreich 
Hundertwasser is followed by one by Afro (Afro Basaldella), 
which is signed "Afro . . . il cow-boy." 126 

In August, Paul Bowles stayed for a few weeks in the palaz- 
zo. His entry in the guest book begins "for Mrs. Bowles," includes 
a musical bar, and then closes with "New York, the non- 
Jewish lake, Easthampton, Venice." 127 His words recall the time 
in the 1940s when Bowles had helped Peggy obtain a lease 
on a country house under the names "Mr. and Mrs. Bowles"; as

a Jew, she would have been denied the rental. Perhaps such 
memories played some part in her generous donation, through 
the American Fund for Israel Institutions, of thirty-four 
paintings — including works by William Baziotes, Max Ernst, 
Helion, Andre Masson, Man Ray, and Pollock — to the Tel-Aviv 
Museum in 1952; indeed, of the many gifts she gave to museums 
around the world, this was to be her second-largest donation to a 
single institution. Eugene Kolb, chief curator of the museum, 
wrote, "It has been the purpose of this gift — for which we cannot 
be grateful enough — to encourage the creation of a special collec- 
tion of abstract and surrealist art in our Museum." 128 

In September, Joan Miro sketched a delightful constellation- 
like form in the guest book. At the end of the month, Hans 
Hartung drew sketches on two pages and Capote as well as 
Read, again quoting from Eliot's The Family Reunion, 
reappeared. As would be the general rule, the autumn and 
winter months were quiet; Peggy's collection was closed to 
the public, and there were fewer foreigners in Venice during 
these seasons.

In March 1953, Laurence Vail and his companion, Yvonne 
Hagen, the art columnist for the International Herald Tribune, 
were among Peggy's visitors; Laurence's wife, Jean Connolly, had 
died in 1952. A friend from the Paris and New York days, 
Caresse Crosby — who had fostered many writers through the 
Black Sun Press in 1920s-30s Paris — became a frequent guest 
and often accompanied Peggy in her gondola. Some guest book 
entries are all the more extraordinary in that several notable 
personalities visited at the same time; for example, Cecil Beaton, 
Capote, and Matta, who wrote, "beware of the 'never man' 
sometimes it 'appears' as a tru man," 129 all appear on one page 
from this summer. During his visit in September, Sam Francis 
wrote the exquisite line: "White is the space between." 130 The 
next day — nearly three years later to the day since his previous 
visit — Frankfurter was at the palazzo. In the autumn, John 
Richardson and the actor Farley Granger also returned. 

In April 1954, Tancredi and Pegeen were guests. 
Subsequently, Max Ernst — who was being awarded the painting 
prize at the Biennale — and his wife, Dorothea Tanning, visited. 
Tanning sketched Peggy's dogs in the book, and Max wrote,

"peace for ever un vrai ami est revenu for ever Contre signe dar- 
ling Peggy" 131 (peace for ever a real friend has come back for 
ever counter signed darling Peggy). Max was now a welcome vis- 
itor at the palazzo, and he and Victor Brauner spent much time 
in Peggy's garden playing with her dogs. As always, summer 
during a Biennale was the busiest time, with visits from curators 
and collectors, as well as such artists as Karel Appel, Arp, 
Robert Brady, Matta, Marino Marini, and David Smith. Clare 
Booth Luce, the United States ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 
1956, whom Peggy described "as usual, was very polite and 
charming, and of course marvelously dressed, looking younger 
and more glamorous than ever," 132 visited one evening. Luce 
appeared to like Pegeen's paintings best because of or despite 
the fact that she thought the people in them appeared to have 
"nothing to say." 133 Arp and his wife, Marguerite, stayed with 
Peggy for a few days and were delighted to ride in her gondola. 
In the guest book, Brauner left a beautiful watercolor reference 
to his painting The Surrealist (January 1947) in Peggy's collec- 
tion. In July, on "the day after Independence Day," 134 Richardson 
and his companion, collector Douglas Cooper, visited; Cooper 
lamented a "very very bad Biennale" but was comforted 
by "pictures in your palazzo which are real works of art." 135 
Composers Ned Rorem and Goffredo Petrassi each left a 
musical bar on a page together. Many years later, Rorem 
described Peggy as having been "rather grand, aware of herself, 



102 




stunning without beauty ... a force in the world of art." 136 
Helen Frankenthaler and Clement Greenberg were guests in 
September 1954. Peggy would travel with them to Milan. 
Frankenthaler has fondly recalled Peggy's "somewhat camou- 
flaged diction" and that she was a "queen who ran a rather for- 
mal palazzo and entertained in Guggenheim style on the Grand 
Canal." 137 Greenberg sketched a gondola in the guest book and 
wrote, "To Peggy, who's transferred her light from N.Y. to Venice, 
to the former's infinite loss and the latter's infinite gain." 138 

After Gregorich died in a car accident in September, Peggy 
felt devastated. 139 Sometime in late fall or in early winter 
1954-55, having decided to get away, she went first to Ceylon to 
visit Paul and Jane Bowles. She then set off alone for India, 
where she "visited over twenty cities in forty-eight days," 140 
including trips to museums and artists' studios. She was disap- 
pointed with the contemporary art in Ceylon and India but was 
impressed by Chandigarh, the new capital of the Punjab, which 
included designs by Le Corbusier. During her travels, she bought 
many fanciful earrings, and in Darjeeling visited Tenzing 
Norkay, not so much because he had climbed Mount Everest 
with Edmund Hillary, but rather because of her interest in his 
long-haired Lhasa apsos. 

With Peggy back in Venice in early 1955, guests again came 
to the palazzo. Giulio Turcato and Edmondo Bacci were among 
the artists who visited. Peggy would help sell Bacci's works to

other collectors and keep two of his paintings, including Event 
#247 (1956), for her collection. In the catalogue of Bacci's solo 
exhibition at Carlo Cardazzo's gallery II Cavallino in 1957, she 
wrote, "Each new work is more vital than the previous one. 
I feel they are so explosive that they put in danger the security 
of my palazzo. Each time that an American enthusiast takes 
one away, I feel that my house is in a less dangerous predica- 
ment. But then, Bacci brings me a new one. Each one is more 
marvellous, more exciting and more dangerous." 141 

Peggy could be generous and gracious spontaneously and 
often unexpectedly, but she could also be selfish, cold, and 
manipulative. In the third guest book, which begins in May 
1955, Sindbad, as he often did, wrote a poem: 

Indeed it is hard 

to be an eternal bard 

To tax one's imagination 

is a perpetual frustration 

It is also banal 

To talk of a canal 

or love and sex 

as an eternal hex 

What a pity 

to be witty 

without the ability. 

Je ne puis ecrire plus 

Car je dois garder un surplus 

pour mon proche retour 

A cette ville ou on ne trouve pas toujours l' AMOUR. 142 



The last four lines — I cannot write anymore / because I must 
keep a surplus / for my next visit / to this town where one does 
not always find love — in particular suggest Sindbad's both 
tender and caustic feelings for his mother. 

Hans Richter was a frequent guest; in recent years, he had 
been working on the Venetian episode of his film 8x8 (1957). 
Buffie Johnson, who had participated in 31 Women at Art of 
This Century, was living at the time in Venice and was a regu- 
lar at Peggy's memorable parties. Johnson, who first met 
Peggy in Paris before World War II, has remembered her 
behaving like a queen and rather impatient in manner. 143 
Visitors in the fall included Consagra, Mary McCarthy, and 
Jack Youngerman.

In spring 1956, poet Alan Ansen made his first visit; in 1959, 
he would put on the first of three masques in Peggy's garden. 
Spender, visiting in March, hoped to be mentioned in the second 
volume of her autobiography should one appear, and novelist 
Alberto Moravia paid a visit together with art historian 
Giovanni Carandente. A "reciprocal intellectual fire" 144 ensued, 
and she talked with Moravia about literature, perhaps her true 
passion, for hours. For his Cavallino editions, Carlo Cardazzo 
asked Peggy to write a book of anecdotes, which Laurence 
Vail entitled Una collezionista ricorda (1956); the dust jacket 
shows Peggy with Alexander Calder's Silver Bedhead and sur- 
rounded by eight Lhasa apsos. Capote arrived in May and stayed 
for six weeks while he wrote The Muses Are Heard (1956), his 
nonfiction account of the American touring company of George 
Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935), whose itinerary had included 
the opera's Italian premiere in Venice in September 1955. In 
1961, on the same page as his 1956 guest book entry, Capote 
would return "to sign this memory of 5 years ago." 145 

That year's Biennale visitors started to come to Peggy's 
palazzo, and one of the first was Katharine Kuh; now a curator 
at the Art Institute of Chicago, she had organized The American 
Painters and the City for the American pavilion. Lynn Chadwick, 
recipient of the sculpture prize, visited Peggy as did Alberto 
Giacometti for the first time since 1949. Other guests included 
Jean Cocteau, a friend since Guggenheim Jeune days. The 
signatures of George Balanchine, whose calligraphy sprawls, 
nearly dancing, across the page, and Anthony Caro, whose hand- 
writing is tidy and cramped, appear on one page of the guest 
book in September. In October, Thomas Messer, not yet the third 
director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, paid the first 
of many visits. 

The first few months of 1957 were relatively quiet until the 
arrival of Claire Falkenstein, who a few years later designed 
the beautiful Entrance Gates to the Palazzo (1961) for the palaz- 
zo's calle (alleyway) entrance. Art historian Leo Steinberg 
wrote in the guest book that Peggy's palazzo was "the only house 
in Venice that does not make one feel ashamed to be of this 
century" 146 Margaret Scolari Barr had instructed Steinberg on 
how to handle Peggy when he visited her: "She will certainly 
take you for a ride in her gondola, and then, if she takes your 
hand, I suggest you let her, on the principle of ga coute si peu et 
ca donne tellement de plaisir! [it costs so little and it gives so 
much pleasure!]" 147 There was no need to accommodate Peggy in 



m.s 



this respect, however, because she began to complain about an 
art museum to which she had given a Pollock painting. Now 
that the Pollock had become so valuable, she wished to retrieve 
it. Steinberg, who advised her to take pride in what she had 
done to promote Pollock's work, was pleasantly surprised by her 
enthusiasm for and knowledge of Venetian art and culture. He 
was delighted that a collector of Modern and contemporary 
art should be so taken with classical Italian art. 148 

Igor Stravinsky signed the guest book with musical bars at 
the end of September, but composer Luigi Nono only left his sig- 
nature. In July, Allen Ginsberg wrote to Peggy in a letter: 

Thank you for saying OK on my coming to your house tomor- 
row night. I've never been in a great formal historic salon 
before &amp; naturally have been eager to go there, be accepted, 
see pictures at leisure, sip big cocktails, gaze over grand 
canal, be a poet in Venice surrounded by famous ladies, 
echoes of Partisan Review &amp; the 20's &amp; surrealists, butlers &amp; 
gondolas, enjoy a little fame and escape the illusion of 
poverty— all tempting, especially the sense of acceptance. 149 

He paid at least one visit that summer, but neither a signature 
nor poem has been found in the guest book. At the end of the 
year, Alec Guinness visited Peggy as did the art historians John 
Fleming and Hugh Honour. 

The poet Gregory Corso, one of the few visitors in January 
1958, left a drawing and a poem in the guest book: 

And she, her ruminating deer, 

2 thousand years old, 

hath hired sight not for sordid cameo — 

but a quiet room of earrings. 

But Bacon screams a melting Baboon 
across the bed! 

The butterfly spectacles tremble! 

O but does not the frenzy of Pollock 

downstairs add to the dumb of earrings? 

Picasso and Arp seem angry at each other— 
Arp in the yard bends tonight- 
Picasso laughs in the too-much light. 

And poor Ernst— his birdy girls are taloned old. 

And all the canvasses grow sea lonely sure. 

And with deep metamorphical gondola eyes 



no 



I see Venice as Death and would embrace it 
were't [sic] it not for an ever constant cry 
of gold in the peace of Parisian noon. 150 

The winter months were quiet in Venice and work was under 
way to build a barchessa— the Venetian word for a place in 
which to store grain and hay— in the garden to provide addition- 
al galleries for Peggy's collection. The barchessa was built— 
along the depth of the garden — at a ninety-degree angle to the 
end of the palazzo's bedroom wing. Venetian authorities consent- 
ed to the new structure with the provision that a substantial 
portion of the garden should separate the new structure from 
the main house. However, only a small area of the garden was 
kept between the two structures, and today the barchessa is 
linked to the palazzo by a passageway. The architect Vincenzo 
Passero was urged to have the barchessa ready in time for the 
Biennale. Peggy gave the workmen a dinner party in her favorite 
restaurant, and she asked them all to write in the guest book. 
Passero made a drawing of the barchessa, and one workman 
wrote a poem in Venetian dialect, in which he called Peggy 
"Leonessa" in honor of the name of her palazzo. Peggy herself 
wrote in the book that this evening had been "the nicest night 
of my life in Venice 1946-1958." 151 

In the spring, James Lord and Bernard Minoret brought 
Dora Maar with them to visit Peggy. As Lord wrote: 

It seemed fitting that two ladies who had in one way or 
another made themselves important to the art of their 
era should come face to face. Peggy was always content to 
parade her pictures and I thought she'd be flattered to 
have under her roof a woman who had so often inspired 
Picasso. The meeting was not a success, because both 
ladies liked being catered to, though not at all in the same 
manner. When we left the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, Dora 
said: "Madame Guggenheim merits our compassion, but 
she wouldn't know how to go about being worthy of it." 
Bernard asked what that meant, and Dora replied, "That's 
the mystery" 152 

The 1958 Biennale brought such visitors to the palazzo as 
Cocteau, the curator William Lieberman, gallery owner Andre 
Emmerich, Antoine Pevsner, and Sutherland. In early 1959, 
Peggy went to Mexico and from there to New York for the first 



111 



time since 1948. She was in New York when Frank Lloyd Wright 
died in April. She visited with friends and family, including 
Harry Guggenheim, who gave her a tour of Wright's nearly com- 
pleted building for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. 
Peggy described Wright's building as "a huge garage ... It is 
built on a site that is inadequate for its size and looks very 
cramped, suffering from its nearness to adjacent buildings. . . . 
Around an enormous space intended for sculpture displays, the 
rising ramp, Wright's famous invention, coils like an evil ser- 
pent." 153 Her old friend James Johnson Sweeney was now the 
museum's director. 

One of Peggy's favorite excursions in America was visiting 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she could once again see 
Walter and Louise Arensberg's collection, and the Barnes 
Foundation, just outside Philadelphia. Peggy found the New 
York art world very changed and could not afford to buy contem- 
porary art, so she began to buy pre-Columbian, African, and 
Oceanic art. She would write, "In fact, I do not like art today. I 
think it has gone to hell, as a result of the financial attitude." 154 
She went on to say: 

One cannot expect every decade to produce genius. The 
twentieth century has already produced enough. We should 
not expect anymore. A field must lie fallow every now and 
then. Artists try too hard to be original. That is why we have 
all this painting that isn't painting any more. For the 
moment we should content ourselves with what the twenti- 
eth century has produced. . . . Today is the age of collecting, 
not of creation. Let us at least preserve and present to the 
masses all the great treasures we have. 155 

Peggy was back in Venice by May. During the spring and 
summer, such personalities as the poet James Merrill and art 
historian Robert Rosenblum visited her. She also had a fond 
reunion with Frederick Kiesler. When Georges Mathieu exhibit- 
ed at II Cavallino, he visited Peggy in September and sketched 
an energetic drawing, in his typical gestural fashion, in the 
guest book. 

The 1960s 

Spring 1960 brought a visit from Justin K. Thannhauser and his 
wife, Hilde, generous donors to the Solomon R. Guggenheim 



112 



Museum. Friends came to the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni during 
the summer, but the guest books contain surprisingly few 
entries during those months. In a letter to Robert Brady, Peggy 
described the Biennale as "worse than ever and Fautrier got 
the biggest prize. He is undoubtedly the worst painter in the 
Biennale. ... I have never seen such a horrible Biennale. Also it 
is more and more like a big money art market and absolutely 
everyone was here." 156 In September, Marcel Duchamp was wel- 
comed to the palazzo, as were composer John Cage, choreograph- 
er Merce Cunningham, dancer Carolyn Brown, and composer 
David Tudor. Cage was a celebrity in Italy, and Cunningham 
wrote in the guest book about the wonderful parties Peggy gave 
for him and his entourage: "party!! party!! all marvelous!!" 157 
In the book, Cage filled two pages with musical bars and his rec- 
ollections of his arrival in New York in 1942: 

When Xenia [then his wife] and I came to New York from 
Chicago, we arrived in the Bus Station with about 25 cents. 
We were invited to stay for a while with you and Max Ernst. 
Max Ernst had met us in Chicago and had said: "Whenever 
you come to New York, come and stay with us. We have a 
big house on the East River." I went to the phone booth in 
the Bus Station, put in a nickel, and dialed. Max Ernst 
answered. He didn't recognize my voice. Finally he said, "Are 
you thirsty?" I said, 'Yes." He said: "Well, come over tomor- 
row for cocktails." I went back to Xenia and told her what 
had happened. She said: "Call him back. We have everything 
to gain and nothing to lose." I did. He said, "Oh! It's you. 
We've been waiting for you for weeks. Your room's ready. 
Come right over." East River 1942, Grand Canal September 
1960 (con La Fenice!)." 158 

In spring 1961, Truman Capote was delighted to be at 
Peggy's again. In May, Man Ray, whom Peggy had not seen for 
many years, came to visit, and his friend and fellow Dadaist, 
Tristan Tzara, whom Peggy had known in Paris in the 1920s, 
arrived a few days later. In the summer, many regular guests 
came, as well as a newcomer, the curator Sam Wagstaff (later 
famous for his photography collection). 

In October, Giacometti came to visit Peggy and wrote in her 
guest book. The director Joseph Losey was in Venice in 
December working on his film Eve ( 1962), which starred Jeanne 
Moreau. He asked Peggy to play an extra. All she had to do 



113 



was sit at a gambling table, for which she was paid a fee of 
80,000 lire, or $125 at the time. That same month, Giorgio 
Albertazzi, who had just starred in Alain Resnais's Last Year at 
Marienbad (1961) visited. During 1961, Claire Falkenstein's 
Entrance Gates to the Palazzo, "wrought-iron gates with brilliant 
lumps of colored glass trapped in the mesh," 159 were installed 
at the palazzo. 

In early January 1962, Peggy participated in a RAI televi- 
sion series about the joys of Venice in winter. Ugo Mulas took 
photographs for Michelangelo Muraro's book Invito a Venezia 
(1962; published in English as Invitation to Venice in 1963), and 
Peggy wrote the introduction, in which she conveyed her love 
for the city. She wrote that "to live in Venice or even to visit it 
means that you fall in love with the city itself. There is nothing 
left over in your heart for anyone else." 160 

Albertazzi returned in early February and inaugurated the 
fourth guest book. It was during this month that Peggy was 
made an honorary citizen of Venice. She wore an extravagant 
black-plumed hat for the occasion and was presented with a cer- 
tificate and magnificent roses at the town hall. Giuseppe 
Santomaso and Emilio Vedova were the only artists to attend 
the ceremony. It was not until the summer that the Biennale 
attracted such old friends as Nelly van Doesburg and E. L. T

Mesens. In the fall, she went to Japan, where she traveled with 
Cage, Tudor, and Yoko Ono, who accompanied them as a transla- 
tor. (In later years, Ono and John Lennon would visit Peggy 
several times, but they did not sign the guest book or leave any 
sketches.) 

In February 1963, Irene Rice Pereira and Peggy Waldman, 
a friend since childhood, came to see Peggy. In October, Claire 
Falkenstein was back to repair the gates. That same month, and 
just a few days after the opening of her exhibition at Galerie 
Laurence in Paris, Helen Frankenthaler came to the palazzo, 
"nine years later," 161 as she noted in the guest book. She was

accompanied by Robert Motherwell, then her husband, who 
acknowledged Peggy as his "first patron" 162 and made a small 
sketch in the style of his series Elegies to the Spanish Republic. 

In January 1964, Peggy went to London to celebrate Herbert 
Read's seventieth birthday. Beginning that April, few drawings 
appear in the guest books. Peggy described the year's Biennale 
as dull, but not quite as dull as the one in 1962; she felt, 
however, that Robert Rauschenberg deserved to win the painting 
prize. Jean Dubuffet was a visitor as were Lee Miller and her 
husband, Roland Penrose. The Venetian glass artist Egidio 
Costantini also visited, and twenty-three of his glass sculptures 
after sketches by Picasso (1964) as well as Clementine (1966), a 
collaboration with Pegeen, would enter Peggy's collection. 

Amid yet another slow winter, Peggy lent her entire collec- 
tion to the Tate Gallery at the invitation of its director, Norman 
Reid. She traveled to London for the exhibition, which opened 
at the very end of December and was shown until March 1965. It 
was a special triumph for Peggy because in 1938 the Tate's then 
director, James B. Manson, had refused to certify that sculptures 
destined for a Guggenheim Jeune exhibition were art. Now, 
she was being courted by the Tate, which published a catalogue 
for the occasion. By the spring, the collection was back at the 
palazzo, and spring and summer saw the return of faithful 
guests as well as Rex Harrison and a German television crew, 
which made a documentary on Peggy. 

In March 1966, Charmion von Wiegand was delighted 
"to see the richly textured and complex collection again and to 
remember the old days in New York." 163 In June, Marcel 
Duchamp, visiting with his wife, Teeny, found it "delicieux de 
voir Peggy sans premeditation" 164 (delicious to see Peggy 
without premeditation). Franchise Gilot and Max Ernst were 
also among the visitors that month. A dinner party was held at 
the restaurant La Fenice in honor of Peggy and Max. Dinner 
guests included Norman Reid and Wilhelm Sandberg, two 
museum directors vying for Peggy's collection. Peggy and Max 
sat next to each other, both older, white-haired, and distin- 
guished. Pegeen sketched her last drawing in a guest book. 
Curator Pontus Hulten visited in September to make arrange- 
ments for Peggy's collection to travel to the Moderna Museet 
in Stockholm. 

November was a particularly tragic month in Venice in the 
aftermath of the disastrous floods that devastated Venice 
and Florence. Peggy would remember this Christmas as very

quiet, without even a tree in piazza San Marco. In December, 
Peggy was made a commendatore of the Italian republic. 
That month, Peggy went to Stockholm for the exhibition of her 
collection, which would be held from November 1966 to January 
1967; she was King Gustav Adolf's guide at the opening. The 
exhibition, which had an accompanying catalogue, traveled to 
the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark. 
After spending a few days in Denmark, Peggy went to visit 
Robert Brady in Mexico at the end of February; it was there that 
she got the tragic news of Pegeen's death from an overdose 
of barbiturates in Paris. Upon her return to Venice, Peggy made 
alterations to the palazzo's galleries and dedicated a memorial 
room solely to Pegeen and her paintings. 

April, as usual, saw the return of longtime friends, as well as 
the visit of the poet Seamus Heaney and his family. Heaney, 
"overawed by the whole evening," has remembered "Peggy show- 
ing us the little rhyme which James Joyce had written in the 
flyleaf of a book: a cunning bit of doggerel, punning bilingually 
on Joyce's chronic inability to be going home early and the word 
Guggenheim." 165 It was a relatively quiet summer, and Peggy 
was still in shock over Pegeen's death. 

Roloff Beny persuaded Peggy to accompany him to India 
in early 1968. She and Beny, whose relationship was as special 
as it was durable, traveled extensively in India. Peggy was 
unspoiled in terms of creature comforts, and they stayed in 
places ranging from small canvas tents to huts in villages to 



lis 



Maharajahs' palaces. She adored Indian food and was particular- 
ly fond of popadum, a light waferlike bread. Because of its cheap 
price and light weight, she ordered a huge quantity to be 
shipped to her palazzo. A gondola load duly arrived, and over 
two years later Peggy was still diligently eating her way through 
the popadum, which should have been crisp but had become 
damp and stale. 

In April, Laurence Vail died in the south of France. That 
spring Bernard Malamud was among the visitors to the palazzo. 
Fewer artists and more European socialites came to visit during 
this particular Biennale; indeed, the student protests of 1968 
had led to many artists refusing to take part in the Biennale. 
Peggy went only once to this Biennale and saw little that inter- 
ested her besides works by Marisol (Marisol Escobar) and Rufino 
Tamayo. She cared less and less for contemporary art although 
she claimed to like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg; she 
said, "I wanted to buy Rauschenberg's goat with a tire around it 
[Monogram , 1955-59, now in the collection of the Moderna 
Museet, Stockholm] for my grandchildren," 166 but she did not 
buy any of his works. In October, Norton Simon visited Peggy 
and asked her whether she would leave her collection to the 
University of California, Berkeley. She retorted that she would if 
he saved Venice; she never heard from him again. 

In January 1969, Peggy arrived in New York, where a selec- 
tion of works from her collection was exhibited at the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum from January to March. A catalogue was 
published for the exhibition. Thomas Messer, director of the 
museum since 1961, was in the midst of a long-term courtship of 
Peggy for the disposition of her collection. Thanks to the patient 
efforts of Messer, Peggy came to make peace with her father's 
family. When Peggy was back in Venice that spring Gore Vidal, 
an old friend, and S. I. Newhouse, a first-time guest were among 
her visitors. 

The 1970s 

Fewer guests came to see Peggy in the 1970s, and of those most 
were familiar faces. Robert Graves was among the few new visi- 
tors. Spring and summer brought Farley Granger and Isamu 
Noguchi, who inscribed his sketch in the guest book as "Merlin's 
circle into which we will disappear." 167 In February 1972, the 
British consul Ashley Clarke and his wife made the first of many 
visits. Giuseppe Santomaso was one of the few artists who came 



I Hi 



to see Peggy during this period. John Hohnsbeen, Peggy's new 
assistant, provided her with much-needed companionship. In 
May, Peggy traveled to Florence with Roloff Beny to see the 
Henry Moore retrospective at Forte Belvedere. The fourth guest 
book concludes in June 1972 with signatures of faithful friends. 
By this time, Peggy was disillusioned with the art world, and 
younger artists either snubbed her or felt snubbed by her. 

The fifth and final guest book consists almost entirely of sig- 
natures. The book covers the period from mid-June 1972 until 
October 1979, a few months before Peggy's death. Time passed 
by quickly in the books, even if it did not do so for an older 
and sadder Peggy. Many of the old guard, as well as a few new- 
comers, continued to visit Peggy. Sindbad continued to make reg- 
ular trips to Venice to see her, and she occasionally came to 
Paris to see him and her grandchildren. Spring and summer 
1973 brought visits from Beny, now celebrating twenty-five years 
of friendship with Peggy, and Cecil Beaton, who returned for 
the last time and sketched a figure in the guest book. In April 
1974, Brassai (Gyula Halasz) came to see her. Among Peggy's 
visitors in June were European aristocracy and royalty; 
Francoise Gilot and her husband, Jonas Salk; collector Eugene 
V. Thaw, coauthor of Jackson Pollock's catalogue raisonne; 
and Thomas Messer. Messer, having at last secured the disposi- 
tion of Peggy's collection for the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Foundation, expressed his "gratitude for my longest, best and 
most fruitful stay to date!" 168 By 1976, the Palazzo Venier 
dei Leoni and her collection were transferred to the control of 
the foundation, which agreed that she would continue to live 
there, and that upon her death the collection would remain 
in place. 

From December 1974 to March 1975, Peggy's collection was 
exhibited in Paris at the Orangerie des Tuileries. A catalogue 
was published, and the exhibition was very successful, but Peggy 
writes in her memoirs that she was treated with little courtesy 
and that everyone was "terribly disagreeable." 169 From December 
1975 to February 1976, Peggy's collection was shown at the 
Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna di Torino, which published an 
exhibition catalogue. Peggy disliked the installation but was 
delighted with the reception from the Communist mayor, who 
offered her "caviar and smoked salmon sandwiches." 170 

Peggy's eightieth birthday party, on August 26, 1978, was 
organized by Jane Rylands— whose husband, Philip, would 
later become deputy director of the Peggy Guggenheim 



120 




Collection — and hosted by Nico Passante, the hotel's director, 
at the Gritti Hotel, just across the canal from the palazzo. The 
guests included Sindbad and Peggy Angela, Ashley Clarke, 
Joseph Losey, and a few close friends. The "ultima Dogaressa," 
as she had come to be called, was celebrated with a beautiful 
white cake in the shape of her palazzo. At the end of December, 
Emilio Vedova paid an unexpected visit to wish Peggy a happy 
new year. 

In May 1979, Peggy was delighted to see Vidal again, who 
had come with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Peggy was 
especially thrilled when Newman agreed to kiss one of her 
maids, believing that as a consequence the maid would stay in 
her employment for at least another year. 171 The Australian 
prime minister, Gough Whitlam also visited at this time. Fond 
comments characterize the final pages of the last guest book. 
Peggy's cousin, the archaeologist Iris Love called her "the one 
member of the family I most admire, and one of the people I 
most respect in the world." 172 

In October, Jimmy Ernst and his wife, Dallas, were the last 
friends to write in the book. Jimmy— who had always liked

Peggy's lack of pretentiousness and whom he had not seen for 
many years — wrote fondly, "My love for you stretches from the 
East River to the Grand Canal. It will last as long as both bodies 
of water exist . . . and longer." 173 Just over two months later, on 
December 23, Peggy, who had not been well for some time, died 
in the hospital in Camposampiero, near Padua. That day in 
Venice, there were floods, and Sindbad and Peggy Angela, both 
knowing that this is what his mother would most appreciate, 
were busy saving her legacy — her art collection, guest books, and 
other possessions — from the tumultuous Venetian waters.

The History of a Courtship 



Thomas M. Messer 



I first met Peggy Guggenheim in the fall of 1956, not long after I 
resigned the directorship of the American Federation of Arts in 
New York to take charge of the Institute of Contemporary Art 
in Boston. My wife, Remi, and I were in Venice at the end of a 
summer vacation in Europe. Slim and dark-haired, Peggy 
received us agreeably — though her manner even then was poised 
on the border between engagingly direct and brusque — at her 
home, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni. She was interested in my 
going to Boston and wanted to know how I was going to work 
out with Perry Rathbone, the director of the Museum of Fine 
Arts. Since the relationship between the museum and the insti- 
tute was at the time being redefined, this delicate question was 
on everyone's mind, but only Peggy would broach it so bluntly. 

Peggy showed us paintings by Edmondo Bacci and Tancredi, 
artists she was promoting at the time. She offered us a hand- 
some Bacci painting for our private collection at three hundred 
dollars. After some verbal skirmishes, she shamed me into buy- 
ing it, and it would serve as a souvenir of my first encounter 
with the "ultima Dogaressa," as some Venetians called her. 
Decades later, after Peggy's death, I gave the painting to the 
Guggenheim for the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. 

In any case, it was not until a few years after my appoint- 
ment to the directorship of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
in 1961 that my contact with Peggy became regularized. It was

position of her collection was for the first time discussed with 

Harry F. Guggenheim, then president of the Solomon R. 

Guggenheim Foundation. Harry was Solomon's nephew and 

Peggy's cousin. Judging from a letter of September 10, 1961, 

written to the foundation's counsel, Chauncey Newlin, Peggy did 

not favor us: "The best place for the pictures after my death

would be the Modern Museum [Galleria Internazionale d'Arte 
Moderna di Ca' Pesaro] of Venice." But something must have 
occurred to modify her thinking over the next few years, 
for on August 4, 1964, Harry wrote to Peggy in response to 
"your inquiry concerning the possibility of the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation ultimately taking over the administra- 
tion of your gallery in Venice and operating it." Peggy responded 
on August 26, "I am very happy that you have not excluded 
my idea as an eventual possibility." 

Typically, however, Peggy had second thoughts. Less than a 
year later, on March 8, 1965, she admitted to Harry, "I never 
wrote to you again about my eventual leaving the collection to 
your Museum, as I was a little afraid of being swallowed up by 
your much more important Foundation." Ever the gentleman 
and also never one to lose face, Harry replied on March 12, "As 
for your collection eventually coming to our Museum here in 
New York, I had really never given any thought to it. ... I have 
no idea what your problems or wishes are." 

For some time thereafter, any idea of pursuing the final dis- 
position of Peggy's collection was dropped in favor of a more lim- 



128 



ited project, the organization of a selection of works from her col- 
lection to be exhibited at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. 
Though this exhibition had appeal in and of itself, it was from 
its inception implicitly linked to hopes of obtaining Peggy's col- 
lection. In her letter of March 8, she also wrote, "Thank you so 
much for your kind invitation to show my collection at the 
Guggenheim Museum," but then mentioned the problems and 
resulting fatigue she had experienced in connection with an 
exhibition of her collection at the Tate Gallery, London, which 
was held from December 1964 to March 1965. Harry, addressing 
himself to this matter in his letter of March 12, responded, "I 
can understand how you feel about another exhibition of your 
pictures right now, following all the trouble and work at the Tate 
exhibition. . . . when you are ready to talk about it . . . arrange- 
ments will be facilitated and made quite easy for you by Tom 
Messer, our Director." 

Harry, probably upon my urging, did not leave it at that. 
"How would you feel," he wrote on December 16, "about a 
Guggenheim Jeune long summer show at the Guggenheim in 
New York in 1967?" (Harry referred to "Guggenheim Jeune" in 
homage to the London gallery she ran during 1938-39. ) Peggy 
responded on January 1, 1966, "I'm afraid that the only time I 
can let the Collection leave Venice is between November and 
Easter when my Museum is closed." In my very first letter 
addressed to Peggy in that same month, I assured her that 
"nothing would please me more than to carry out such a project." 
When, subsequently, I informed her that "I plan to be in Venice 
from June 25 for the rest of the month," I therewith announced 
the first of a dozen or so pilgrimages I was to make to Peggy's 
palazzo during her lifetime. Peggy did not immediately react to 
my announcement, and when we met, she kept her distance 
from me. Apart from her persisting fears about being "swallowed 
up" by the foundation in New York, her relationship with the 
Guggenheim family was far from close as a result of a longstand- 
ing antagonism between her and Hilla Rebay, uncle Solomon's 
"muse" and the Guggenheim's first director. Knowing this, I had 
reason to suspect that she saw me as Harry's agent— as an agent 
of the Guggenheims— and as someone toward whom a posture of 
caution was in order. 

During our early acquaintance, Peggy left the burden of 
approach entirely to me. I would buy huge bouquets of flowers 
and when the intercom voice at the palazzo gate intoned its 
"pronto," I would, flowers in hand, use one of the few Italian 



129 



words then at my command to reply "fiori." It worked, and 
Peggy, to whom I eventually told the story, liked it and became 
more readily accessible. But even long after we had established a 
friendlier relationship, Peggy would lapse into moods of suspi- 
ciousness and wariness. 

The courtship, however, continued. Upon my return from 
Italy, Harry wrote to Peggy rather optimistically on August 9, 
"We are all happy to know that at long last, come 1968, we shall 
have an exhibition of Guggenheim Jeune at the Guggenheim." 
On September 24, she responded guardedly, "I did indeed talk to 
Tom Messer . . . and we agreed to decide next spring when I 
could be ready to have another exhibition." 

A few months later, in a letter addressed to me on January 11, 
1967, she put her commitment in writing, thereby creating 
something of a panic in our ranks by stating, "I think it would be 
advisable to have the show with you next winter." We had 
intended that the exhibition be held in late 1968, and holding 
the exhibition in the winter of 1967-68 would have required the 
rescheduling of exhibitions to which we were already committed. 
Not wishing to appear negative, however, I responded on 
January 18 that "if you confirm the 1967-68 winter booking 
finally and irrevocably, I shall move the necessary mountains to 
accommodate it." With less circumspection, Harry wrote to her 
on January 23, "We are delighted that you have decided to send 
your collection earlier than anticipated." To which Peggy 
responded on January 29, "I am pleased to know that everything 
will be alright for 1967." 

Such relatively auspicious beginnings were brought to a 
standstill as a result of the tragic death of Peggy's daughter, 
Pegeen Vail, on March 1. There is no question that this loss 
proved a body blow from which, in a sense, Peggy never fully 
recovered. Exhibition plans obviously had to be shelved, and it 
was not until April 5 that I deemed it appropriate to address the 
business at hand. "Quite understandably," I wrote, "I have not 
heard from you recently. ... I find that I could adjust previous 
plans to arrange for a showing early December 1967 into early 
February 1968." 

Through no fault of Peggy's, my initial doubts regarding 
the feasibility of the proposed dates proved well-founded. 
In a letter of April 11, the first communication I had following 
Pegeen's death, Peggy wrote, "It is most unfortunate that I 
asked you to change the date of the exhibition of my collection 
in the Guggenheim Museum to 1967. ... I will be in mourning 



130 



for a year and could not possibly consider any parties or doing 
any publicity myself this year." I must have concluded well 
before Peggy's response that delays would be unavoidable, for I 
replied on April 19, "I had not made the change from 1968 to 
1967 final, since it would have involved us in a great deal of dif- 
ficult reorganization." 

Then, during a summer visit with Peggy, exhibition plans 
were discussed in some detail and lists were drawn up. The 
show was rescheduled to open in January 1969. I was thus able 
to review the exhibition's status in writing, concluding in a vein 
indicative of some tenseness in our conversations: "I thoroughly 
enjoyed my visit with you, much appreciated your candor, and 
hope you didn't mind mine." 

During her depression as a result of Pegeen's death, Peggy 
was not easy to deal with. Following my summer visit, she had 
written to me in evident ill humor: "I am feeling so completely 
unfit to face the public that I can't bear to think of coming to 
New York next year and get into a whirl of parties and press 
reviews." For good measure, she added, "I do not like your list. It 
almost looks as though I had stopped collecting after Pollock. 
Also your values are much too low." In self-defense, I wrote back 
on November 30, "With regard to the list, it should certainly 
reflect correctly your collecting personality. . . . My insurance list 
was no more than a personal evaluation made upon your 
request." This capitulation notwithstanding, Peggy returned to 
the same matter on April 11, 1968, with more emphasis: 
"I have been speaking to several people about your selection 
from my collection and have come to the conclusion that it is not 
at all fair to leave out so many important works as it gives a 
very bad idea of my collection. Therefore I must insist that you 
include the following works or give up the show altogether." 
Thoroughly cowed by such threats I responded on April 18, "Of 
course we do not even want to think about giving up a show to 
which we are all deeply committed. The additions which you 
have indicated are eminently acceptable and will, I feel sure, 
enrich the situation." 

Peggy's moods and humors, whether good or bad, rarely 
remained the same for any length of time, but the year following 
Pegeen's death as a whole reflected her discouragement more 
than her positive outlook. In a letter of July 12, following one of 
my visits, she made appreciative mention of "your beautiful flow- 
ers" and even returned to the issue of her collection's eventual 
disposition for the first time since 1965. But what she had to say 



131 



failed to hold out much hope: "I did not tell you," she wrote, "but 
I am leaving the house and the collection here, and Italy has not 
lost it after all. It is not that I think that they deserve it, but the 
thing is complete in itself and must remain so." 

Meanwhile, the arrangements for the exhibition in New York 
were moving along. Peggy discussed details in the same letter as 
well as in a subsequent one of July 17, informing me that "Sattis 
[a Venetian fine-arts shipping company] came this morning to 
measure so no more changes will be considered," and "I have 
rewritten my introduction starting from the fifth paragraph 
before the end of the Tate Gallery text." On the other hand, still 
nervous about dates and possible complications in my schedul- 
ing, I wrote apprehensively as late as September 6, "Let me con- 
firm that the opening date for the exhibition is now irrevocably 
set for January 15, 1969." 

Then, out of the clear blue sky, came another outburst for 
which I was ill prepared. On September 6, the same day I was 
writing to her, she hurled the following accusation at me: "I have 
received an invitation to your Peruvian show [Mastercraftsmen 
of Ancient Peru, an exhibition held October 1968-January 1969] 
and now realize why you have put off my show until January. I 
imagine it has something to do with Guggenheim interests in 
South America. ... I feel very badly about this as you can imag- 
ine." And proceeding in the same combative vein, Peggy demand- 
ed, "I would like first of all a guaranty from you about how many 
paintings you will restore for me. . . . The only reason I lend my 
collection is to get it restored." Since I had had occasion to com- 
plain in the past that so many of our warmly amicable visits 
tended to be followed up by nasty letters from her, Peggy felt 
moved to remark, "I suppose you will consider this another nasty 
letter. I hope not." In my response of September 10, I allowed 
that "after talking to you at length during the summer I can no 
longer think of your letters as nasty, but I do think that you are 
jumping to false conclusions." I then explained truthfully that 
"the Peruvian show has nothing, whatsoever, to do with what 
you assume." 

But the storm passed as suddenly as it had gathered, and for 
a while at least, all proceeded rather serenely and in low key. 
"Thank you very much for your nice telegram. No, there was no 
cause for alarm," wrote Peggy on November 6, when I expressed 
concern about reports of floods in Venice. On December 2, I 
replied, "I am happy to hear that the aqua was not so alta." 
Then, with lingering unease, I added, "The great opening is

scheduled for January 15." Before this, on November 14, Peggy 
had acknowledged, "I have just received the introductions of the 
catalogue for my exhibition. I am extremely pleased with them." 
She then added, "I am sending a [Theo] van Doesburg after 
all . . . as it is badly in need of repair. . . . Also, the [Giuseppe] 
Santomaso which you included in your original list, and which I 
removed but which I now deem necessary to show (if not too 
late) as he has become a Trustee of the [Peggy Guggenheim] 
Foundation." 

On December 13, I wrote with obvious relief, "We have now 
completed a detailed check of the shipment from Venice and . . . 
trivia apart, everything is in good order." On December 17, 
Peggy let me know, "I would like to stay in a small hotel near 
the Museum. What about the Adams?" But the suggestion was 
withdrawn on December 22 because "I have been told by a friend 
that the Adams Hotel is HORRIBLE." Also, since I had written 
before that I was suffering from the Hong Kong flu, she now 
asked, "Could you please, if possible, arrange to have your doctor 
give me an anti-Hong Kong flu injection. But most of all I want 
to know how long I am to be Harry's guest." I was at this time 
away from New York, and these questions were fully answered 
by my secretary in a letter dated December 26. 

There was no further correspondence prior to Peggy's arrival 
in New York on the day before the grand opening of our 
exhibition, Works from the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation, on 
January 15, 1969. It was, in keeping with the season, a cold 
winter afternoon. Robin Green, the museum's public affairs offi- 
cer, accompanied me in a limousine to JFK airport at around 
three p.m. We waited for a long time, but Peggy had failed to 
appear. Milling around dejectedly in the crowded arrival area, I 
suddenly spied her, and we fell into each other's arms— I out of 
relief; she because her entire baggage was lost, and she needed 
help. We had naturally provided for first-class passage, but 
Peggy, as parsimonious with other people's money as with her 
own, insisted upon traveling economy class. Fussy and difficult 
though she could be at times, she was unperturbed and only 
mildly annoyed that her evening toilette was evidently heading 
toward some distant continent. Our offers to take her shopping 
were gratefully but firmly rejected. She said that she would 
come to the black-tie opening "in her boots," which is exactly 
what she did and with considerable panache. 

A small family dinner had been planned for the evening of 
Peggy's arrival. Peter Lawson-Johnston, Solomon's grandson and

at the time vice president of our foundation, presided in Harry's 
absence, which was due to the latter 's illness. It was the first 
occasion for her to see my installation of her collection at the 
Guggenheim. Such moments are always uneasy, but particularly 
with a person as moody and unpredictable as Peggy. She walked 
into the museum with me before the arrival of other guests, took 
a long and thoughtful look, and made two pronouncements: 
"My pictures now look like postage stamps," and "If my uncle 
Solomon can now see me, he is surely turning in his grave." 
Such asides notwithstanding, Peggy was, during her first public 
evening, as well as the grand opening the following night, 
pleased and gracious, masterful in impromptu press encounters, 
and delighted with the many friends who turned out to see her. 
Apart from showing signs of a more or less permanent streak of 
sadness— surely deepened by the memory of Pegeen's death— she 
was cheerful and delightful throughout her New York stay. 

The most far-reaching effect of Peggy's visit was her decision, 
long in gestation no doubt, to leave her collection in the care of 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. This decision was

something she communicated to me and which, in turn, I was 
able to convey to Harry, who, sad to remember, remained inca- 
pacitated throughout her visit and was therefore unable to see 
her. Though uncertain and vacillating when details, arrange- 
ments, and procedures were at issue, Peggy held firm to her gift 
commitment once it was made. A contractual letter stating the 
conditions of legal transfers from Peggy Guggenheim to the 
Peggy Guggenheim Foundation, and then from that entity to the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was duly submitted on 
January 27. This was followed, on February 14, by my proposals 
to embark upon a program of conservation for her collection 
under Guggenheim Museum auspices and by Harry's offer to her 
of a life membership. 

My summer visit to Peggy's palazzo was so friendly that 
upon returning from Europe, I wrote on August 21, "I felt toward 
you more than ever, open and relaxed, protective and affection- 
ate." I also reported on my visit to Romania and related efforts 
to secure important Constantin Brancusi sculptures for a retro- 
spective exhibition, which we were to share with the Art 
Institute of Chicago and the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the

Guggenheim Museum showing was to open in November. 
I had my eye on the two Brancusis in her collection: Maiastra 
(1912 [?]) and Bird in Space (L'Oiseau dans Uespace, 1932-40). 
"I got more glamorous Brancusis, but no birds to speak of from 
anyone, except from you, if you were angelically disposed, as I 
hope you will be," I wrote. She was not and a brief angelic phase 
was waning again. On October 1, she wrote that "the last five 
paintings came back [from New York] at last. . . . Four are fine, 
but the Cubist Picasso [The Poet (he Poete, August 1911)] looks 
like hell." 

Before I could answer her charge leveled at the first stages of 
a mutually agreed conservation program that had resulted in a 
competent cleaning of The Poet's canvas surface, she continued 
on October 3, "Was particularly upset yesterday when I again 
put my mind on the Picasso painting of the poet." Then, switch- 
ing subjects, "I am still trying to transfer this house to you with 
the least expense. That is without paying taxes and if possible 
without paying a lawyer." On October 17, I had a chance to 
return to the Picasso issue and wrote that "our conservation peo- 
ple would really like you to send back the Picasso together with 
anything else in need of conservation." And hoping against hope, 
I returned once again to our upcoming Brancusi exhibition: "I 
wonder whether I may approach you now with a formal request 
for your two Brancusis." The matter was finally put to rest by 
Peggy's reply of November 30: "Sorry but I did not feel like send- 
ing my two pieces but the less travel the better." She also 
informed me that "I have now decided not to send back any 
paintings to America [for conservation]." 

On January 2, 1970, she wrote, to the obvious discomfort of 
our conservation experts, "I have not yet decided what to do with 
The Poet. Everyone gives me different advice but I think a new 
coat of varnish will be the best solution." Finally, in the same let- 
ter, she stated, "I am trying now to put this house in the name of 
the Solomon Guggenheim Museum so as not to have to make 
two transfers." Otherwise, partly perhaps because the urgencies 
imposed by the exhibition Works from the Peggy Guggenheim 
Foundation were no longer upon us, correspondence between us 
became less frequent. After another summer visit to Venice, 
which was characteristically amicable, I had occasion to write to 
Peggy on August 21, "As always, visiting with you and talking to 
you was rewarding and heart-warming." 

The following year, 1971, provided a new and not at all 
pleasant subject for our correspondence. My first inkling of the

crisis came through a letter, dated February 10, Peggy wrote to 
her lawyer-accountant, Bernard Reis, which he forwarded to me: 
"I had a bad surprise while I was in London; the girls [her ser- 
vants] phoned to say that thieves had broken into my house and 
stolen 13 paintings." The circumstances of the theft were never 
particularly clear to me, nor were those of their speedy recovery 
It was all molto Italiano, with the chief of police emerging as the 
hero. I cabled Peggy on February 22: "so VERY RELIEVED." And fol- 
lowed up on February 25: "Would you want me to send Orrin 
Riley, our conservator in chief, to see how your security setup 
can be improved? Would you also let me know whether the dam- 
age reported in the case of one work needs our attention?" By 
way of reply, I received a letter, dated March 14, which clearly 
was not written by Peggy, except for the few corrections 
inscribed upon the typed text in her handwriting. The somewhat 
ponderous contents— articulated no doubt by Peggy's assistant, 
John Hohnsbeen— proposed with respect to the security system 
that "I would be most grateful if the Guggenheim Museum could 
help defray this expense." Then, in Peggy's handwriting: "Or 
should I possibly get it off my income tax?" I traveled to Venice 
to survey the damage and assess our future options. I found 
Peggy in high spirits, and we spent perhaps the most uninhibit- 
ed and lovely time together, ever. She confirmed my own senti- 
ments by writing to me on September 3, "We had such a nice, 
gay evening the other night before you left. I was very grateful 
because such evenings are very rare nowadays. Love." 

Peggy could be— and often was— simultaneously generous 
and stingy, merry and sad, outgoing and withdrawn, simple and 
complex. She was obsessively preoccupied with material things, 
yet not unconcerned with principle ( although the nature of her 
morality was quirky and often difficult to establish). She had a 
warm and authentic relationship toward art and artists, but 
her collecting taste was never methodic and often not even 
attentive. She was neither a scholar nor an intellectual, 
although she appreciated and admired the company of both and 
moved within such circles with ease and tact. She was nothing if 
not direct and outspoken, yet her straightforwardness— which 
incidentally is a Guggenheim trait— consciously or otherwise, 
masked greater complexities of which she may or may not have 
been aware. Above all, there was something indescribably sad, 
even tragic, about Peggy. To my mind, the strokes of fate that 
she suffered did not fully account for this. In some strange way, 
she seemed troubled about her very existence, and her tendency 



140 




to surround herself with men and women of quality was rooted 
perhaps in her need for attachments that would uphold her. 
Despite such constraints, Peggy was capable of great courage, 
style, and grandeur, and she translated these attributes into an 
admirable life. 

Peggy remained as mercurial as ever, and she broke my 
heart by writing on November 11, "No one came to see about the 
restoration of the pictures or to see about security measures. 
Does that mean that the Guggenheim Museum has given up the 
project? ... It seems ages since our gay dinner at the Angelo." 
I had to tell her on November 30: "You are jumping to conclu- 
sions .... Orrin Riley's trip was postponed for unrelated reasons 
and he is scheduled now to be in Venice [in January 1972]." But 
a final blow came in another letter from Peggy, this one simply 
dated December: "I am very sorry to have to tell you that 
January is too late. Why did you put it off so long? Last night

thieves came, broke through the grills of the sitting-room win- 
dow and carried off ... 17 [paintings] in all." The second such 
calamity within one year left me feeling stoic rather than 
upset— at least in part because one began to expect a repetition 
of the pattern surrounding the previous theft. Indeed, subse- 
quent events bore out my instincts; almost immediately, the 
works were recovered. 

Before the resumption of my correspondence with Peggy 
after a period of several months, Peter Lawson- Johnston— who 
had become president of the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Foundation in 1969— had grown concerned about Peggy's request 
for financial aid and had written to her on February 29, 1972, 
"It has come to my attention that you may be prepared to sell a 
work of art from your collection to raise the necessary funds 
[for the security system]. If so, would you consider selling it to 
us?" Somewhat to my surprise, Peggy responded quickly to 
Peter on March 8, "I think your suggestion of buying a picture 
from my collection is acceptable. The details can be worked 
out with Messer." Trying to keep the subject alive, I wrote on 
April 10 that "Peter Lawson- Johnston has told me of your recent 
letter and I am delighted to know that his proposal to you is 
acceptable."

My visit to Venice in early 1973 took place in a climate 
nothing less than euphoric— "Dear Tom nice Tom sweet Tom," 
Peggy wrote in February, no doubt in further allusion to my com- 
plaints about her nasty epistolary manners. "Do come around 
the middle of the month. If you wish I can put you up. Love"— 
and she seemed entirely willing to pay for the already installed 
security system with funds derived from our payment for a work 
of art that would formally leave Peggy's collection to become 
part of the Guggenheim Museum's permanent collection in 
New York. After my return to New York, I wrote on April 17 that 
"my half-day visit with you remains unforgettable" and touched 
upon a number of pending issues, among them to consummate 
the transfer, in keeping with our agreed bargain, of Joseph 
Cornell's Fortune Telling Parrot (Parrot Music Box) (ca. 1937-38) 
to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In a subsequent letter, 
Peggy started with the same affectionate appellation as in 
February, only to continue, "As to the Cornell, I have decided 
not to let it go to the Guggenheim Museum." Nor did she offer to 
let anything else take its place. There was nothing for me to do 
but respond gently and lovingly on June 19, "As ever, I find it 
easy enough to agree with your changing propositions." It 
should be added in connection with the subject of the security 
system that, throughout Peggy's lifetime, it remained largely 
ineffective despite our best efforts. She either forgot to turn it on 
or, having done so, failed to follow procedures that would 
control it as she reentered the palazzo. The effect of such negli- 
gence was that the police station wished the system had never 
been installed; in an attempt to save face by pretending that she 
was merely testing, Peggy always greeted the onrushing polizia 
with "prova, prova!" 

Despite continued efforts by White &amp; Case, our legal repre- 
sentatives, and Graziadei, the charmingly named Italian law 
firm charged with the same matter in Italy, excruciatingly slow 
progress was being made on the legal front with efforts to have 
arrangements between the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation and 
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation ratified by the Italian 
authorities. Peter, toward whom Peggy had developed warm 
sympathies, had written to her on July 25, 1972, in a spirit as 
yet untainted by skepticism: "I gather everything will be wound 
up relatively soon regarding our formal acceptance of your gift of 
Palazzo Venier dei Leoni." 

In 1973, things were progressing satisfactorily, with the 
exception of an idea of Peggy's that caused me some concern. In 



144 




conversations with me, she introduced the notion that her 
favorite grandson, Nicolas Helion, should become "curator" of 
her collection after her death. While I remained noncommittal, 
Nicolas wrote in an undated letter in 1973, "Ma grand-mere, 
Madame Peggy Guggenheim, vous a entretenu de mon project 
qui est de devenir directeur de la fondation de Venise." (My 
grandmother, Madame Peggy Guggenheim, has spoken to you of 
my desire to become director of the Venice museum.) He proceed- 
ed to questions as to his salary if he came to the New York 
museum prior to such an assignment. After clarifying the dis- 
tinction between a trainee and a salaried position, I answered on 
July 19, "I have suggested . . . that if in future you were to take 
an active part, you would have to be properly prepared and 
qualified." I made arrangements for his university enrollment, 
but it became clear in the meantime that Nicolas had developed 
other interests, and the matter was gradually dropped. Apart 
from an unsuccessful loan request in November— this time for 
a work by Alberto Giacometti in Peggy's collection— 1973 contin- 
ued to be relatively calm. 

On January 2, 1974, I wrote to Peggy, "We mused about the 
possibility of my return visit to Venice . . . and if so, whether you 
would have me ... in February?" Whereupon, Peggy responded 
by telling me about "a dog who got the mange, then broke his

foot, and on top of all, I got arthritis" and then adding "but, if 
you want to come so please do." Apparently, I could not resist the 
warmth of this invitation, and there were also new legal develop- 
ments for which we needed Peggy's approvals. 

Sometime after my return, I wrote on April 22, "It appears 
that the transfer of the Palazzo has indeed been completed" and 
on October 21, Peter confirmed it in a letter to Peggy, "I have 
just been informed about the legal arrangements regarding your 
collection." So far so good, but then she replied on November 1, 
"There is another problem. The place is a shambles as all the 
rain comes in and is beginning to ruin all the pictures." Peggy's 
revelations unfortunately were neither exaggerated nor unex- 
pected, and for some time the decision to accept her gift 
remained an issue among the foundation's trustees, many of 
whom doubted the prudence of accepting an unendowed palazzo 
and collection— no matter how valuable. Luckily for those who 
argued differently, things had reached a point of no return, and 
those favoring acceptance included Peter, the foundation's presi- 
dent. The trustees' authorizing documents were thus signed with 
some vestigial reluctance. Many years of negotiations were about 
to be finalized, and the issue of providing financial assistance for 
the maintenance of the palazzo and the collection was much dis- 
cussed. Relative to it, in a memorandum from me to Peter, I sug- 
gested that "we accept responsibility in principle but that we 
ourselves be involved in the remedy." In accordance with this 
line of reasoning, Peter wrote to Peggy on December 2, "I believe 
that the Board [of trustees] will approve of emergency expendi- 
tures for essential restoration [and] renovation under certain 
conditions." 

The Peggy Guggenheim Foundation minutes approving the 
transfer of the collection and palazzo from it to the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Foundation were dated July 17, 1975, but uncer- 
tainty about the terms, as well as certain procedural aspects, 
continued to bother both sides. On August 22, I worried about 
the artworks, writing to Peggy, "The matter of the conditions of 
some works remains a very grave concern and I wonder whether 
you would receive Orrin Riley if I dispatched him to Venice." The 
answer this time came from Hohnsbeen, and although Peggy 
wished what she had to say to come to me by indirection, the let- 
ter itself is filled with her inimitable touches. Hohnsbeen may 
have written that "it is, of course, important that Orrin Riley be 
given as much time as possible to inspect the collection," but this 
is followed in Peggy's suspicious vein: "She [Peggy] was most

upset to learn that you wished the conditions she made with 
Harry Guggenheim withdrawn, and she insisted they be rein- 
stated. Why do you want this left out?" In the absence of any 
basis whatsoever for such a charge, I decided not to bother with 
Hohnsbeen but to wire directly to Peggy on September 12, "What 
you assume to be a withdrawal of your conditions you need not 
fear, Peggy. No one here has any thought, let alone intention, to 
change our agreement." Peggy remained unconvinced, writing to 
me on November 14, "Bernard [Reis] told me that I should have 
a letter from you, so I am afraid I cannot accept your cable as a 
guarantee." 

As so often in the past, such storms — engendered by Peggy 
on the basis of hearsay or misunderstood information— passed, 
and good weather stayed until the next downpour. In 1976, the 
Peggy Guggenheim Foundation was finally terminated, and legal 
possession of the collection and palazzo was transferred to the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. 

After I wrote to Peggy on May 17, 1976, that "the Biennale 
calamity is upon us and since I have some official contact with it 
this time, I will not be able to avoid Venice in July," she 
received me in May with her usual warmth and cordiality. It was 
never difficult for me to establish contact with her in face-to-face 
meetings. She would sit me down in her living room, give me a 
drink, and immediately and unhesitatingly ask me questions 
that others might have put with some hesitation if at all. 
Conventional inquiries were used for warming-up purposes only. 
After this, she wanted to know details about her New York rela- 
tives, specifically about how I got along with my Guggenheims. 
I told her stories about how difficult and virtually impossible it 
used to be to say "no" to Harry during his lifetime (he had died 
in 1971); the best I could ever do was to say, "Yes sir, but . . . ." 
She responded, "I love that, what you said was Yes, but no!'" 
Looking at me with smiling inquisitiveness, she would ask 
whether I had any girlfriends, and what my wife's attitude was 
in such situations. My opinion about the sexual preferences 
of common acquaintances was regularly sought, and any indis- 
cretion that I was willing to traffic was received with childlike 
gratitude. 

My interactions with Peggy during visits to Venice were 
pleasant interludes, but back in New York more substantial 
issues were never far away. Not long after my return from my 
visit in May, we had a new problem, as a letter of mine, dated 
July 26, proved. I wrote to Peggy about a Fernand Leger paint- 



I IS 



ing— one of his Contrastes de formes— that now appeared to be 
of uncertain authorship. I was obliged to tell her that it would 
probably not figure in future publications of the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection. For some time following the disclosure 
Peggy clung to "her favorite painting." But on October 18, she 
tempered such hopes with an admirable touch of realism: "I have 
left a letter," Peggy writes on that date, "giving you the authority 
to dispose of the Leger." But it took many reminders before, only 
two months prior to her death, she handed me a typed slip made 
up of two unequivocal statements that by strict logic would be 
considered mutually exclusive. The first sentence read: "I hereby 
authorize Thomas Messer to dispose of by sale or exchange CON- 
traste DE FORMES by FERNAND LEGER dated 1913 if it should be 
advisable." To which, however, she added: "Also insist that any- 
thing I will to the Guggenheim Museum can never be sold." 

In the late 1970s, Peggy often thought and spoke of her 
death, probably because of her deteriorating physical condition, 
especially the intensification of her arthritis, and the pain con- 
nected with it, which never left her. But there was neither self- 
pity nor lament as her life moved toward its close. Among the 
questions she posed were those concerning arrangements regard- 
ing the palazzo. She was apprehensive that anyone might stay 
there after her death, and I assured her that this was not part of 
our thinking. For obvious reasons, I did not as a rule volunteer 
intentions, but when she "supposed" that we might transform 
the entire palazzo into gallery spaces, I nodded agreement. She 
remained concerned with material matters to the end, writing to 
me on May 18, 1977, "As I had to pay this tax in the name of the 
Solomon Guggenheim I think it is only right that I should be 
reimbursed." As usual in such situations, I answered meekly, 
"We shall be glad to reimburse you for the tax which you have 
paid out." 

A year later, on June 1, 1978, Peggy wrote to Peter, "I have 
asked the American consul to come here from Trieste to make a 
power of attorney for Sindbad [her son]. ... I think everything is 
covered." Still concerned with possessions, Peggy apparently 
asked Hohnsbeen to write to Angelica Zander Rudenstine, to 
whom I had assigned the catalogue research for the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection: "I would like to leave the dining-room 
furniture to the Solomon R. Guggenheim, but I will only leave it 
to them on the condition that it remains in the dining room here 
as a permanent part of the collection never to be sold." To allay 



150 



her concerns, I wrote on January 4, 1979, "I took the matter to 
the Board and enclose the pertinent passage as well as the reso- 
lution which, I trust, is in keeping with your request." 

On April 16 followed my periodic announcement of a forth- 
coming visit: "I am scheduled to participate in Venice Biennale 
meetings on May 3, 4, and 5. I would love to see you and will call 
upon arrival." The visit took place as indicated despite her ail- 
ments and, I believe, her growing presentiments of death. Peggy 
was cheerful and lovely. Her flock of dogs was reduced by attri- 
tion to two, and we joked that my longstanding promise to hurry 
to Venice immediately upon her demise to take care of the dogs 
was now a much less extensive chore. As it turned out, I never 
had to fulfill this pledge at all, since the last of her "beloved 
babies" (as she called her canine brood) died, with considerable 
tact and finesse, a few days before his mistress. 

Among other practical matters, I felt free to raise the issue 
of postmortem access to the palazzo, pointing out that I might 
have trouble taking possession of the premises if someone 
were inside, to say nothing of the difficulties of scaling the high 
garden wall if no one were. Peggy considered the matter with 
the utmost seriousness and then took two characteristically sim- 
ple measures. Addressing herself to the first eventuality, she 
let me prepare a brief "To Whom It May Concern" for her signa- 
ture. Dated May 3, it said, "This is to certify that the Palazzo 
Venier dei Leoni and the art collection contained therein is the 
property of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New 
York. It is therefore my wish that Mr. Thomas M. Messer, 
Director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, or his deputy 
be admitted without delay to the above premises upon my 
death." Having considered the alternate situation, she simply 
handed me the one key that would open the garden gate as well 
as the palazzo portals.
