Noland and Caro with Olitski sculp-

Preface and Acknowledgements 




Olitski and Noland, South Shaftsbury, 1965 



Few contemporary artists have drawn as deeply 
as Kenneth Noland from a great variety of 
sources or translated such a wealth of mate- 
rial into a more independent and personal ex- 
pression, as is so cogently argued in Diane 
Waldman's text in this catalogue. His teachers, 
Albers and Bolotowsky, older masters like Ce- 
zanne, Picasso, Mondrian, and more directly 
Klee and Matisse, the seminal intermediary fig- 
ure of Pollock, as well as his friends and col- 
leagues Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, David 
Smith and Caro, served Noland in his search 
for forms and images that ultimately became 
uniquely and unmistakably his own. Noland 
developed his mature work in separate series, 
each possessed of a conspicuous identity: the 
concentric circles, cat's-eyes, chevrons, dia- 
monds, stripes, plaids, and his most recent 
shaped canvases. Paradoxically, such a self-im- 
posed restriction to a number of basic themes 
creates an unexpected wealth of imagery in 
Noland's case. 

Despite the clarity of his imagery and the 
sensuous appeal of his surfaces, Kenneth No- 
land's work is not easily comprehended. The 
selection of paintings, the structuring of the 
exhibition and the interpretation of Noland's 
oeuvre in a catalogue essay therefore could be 
undertaken only by one as qualified as Diane 
Waldman, the Guggenheim Museum's Curator 
of Exhibitions. Mrs. Waldman worked closely 
with the artist and derived great benefit from 
his wisdom, kindness and intelligence and 
enthusiastic collaboration. The responsibility 
inherent in the mounting of an artist's first 
major retrospective in a New York show posed 
complex problems for the Guggenheim's ad- 
ministration as well as for its curatorial and 
technical departments. These tasks were dis- 



charged with competence and skill. Orrin 
Riley, Saul Fuerstein and Cherie Summers 
were most directly involved in the technical 
and preparatory aspects of the exhibition and 
are therefore entitled to our special gratitude. 
Particular thanks are due to Mrs. Waldman's 
assistant Clair Zamoiski, who aided in all 
stages of the exhibition, and Carol Fuerstein, 
who edited the catalogue and worked on all 
phases of documentation for the publication. 

On Mrs. Waldman's behalf I would like to 
thank, in addition to those cited above, the 
family and friends of the artist, among them 
Neil and Harry Noland, Anthony Caro, Clem- 
ent Greenberg, Michael Steiner, Jim Wolfe and 
Willard Boepple, whose enthusiasm has been 
invaluable. Mrs. Waldman also wishes to ac- 
knowledge the following galleries and individ- 
uals: Andre Emmerich Gallery, New York and 
Ziirich; David Mirvish Gallery, Toronto; Wad- 
dington and Tooth Galleries Limited, London; 
Kasmin Limited, London; Leo Castelli Gallery, 
New York; Galerie Wentzel, Hamburg; Blum/ 
Helman Gallery, New York; Lawrence Rubin 
of M. Knoedler and Co., New York; Nicholas 
Wilder Gallery, Los Angeles; John Berggruen, 
San Francisco; Robert Murdock; Charles 
Cowles and Kenworth Moffett. Mrs. Waldman 
is particularly grateful to Martha Baer of Ac- 
quavella Contemporary Art, who arranged her 
first meeting with the artist in 1971. 

The Kenneth Noland retrospective could 
not have taken place without the full coopera- 
tion of lenders in this country and abroad or 
without the greatly valued financial support 
of the National Endowment for the Arts in 
Washington, D.C. It is due also to the for- 
bearance of the former and the generous aid 
of the latter that a major portion of the exhibi- 



tion will travel to the Hirshhorn Museum and 
Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, and 
the Corcoran Gallery of Art, both in Washing- 
ton, D.C, as well as other institutions for which 
a schedule has not yet been determined. 

To all those mentioned, to the lenders who 
are listed separately and to Kenneth Noland 
himself, I herewith extend the Guggenheim 
Museum's sincerest thanks.

Kenneth Noland 



by Diane Waldman 



The third of four sons, Kenneth Noland was 
born on April 10, 1924, in Asheville, North 
Carolina. On his father's side, the family had 
settled in North Carolina a few generations be- 
fore, while his mother's family, Elkins, had 
originally come from West Virginia. Asheville, 
with a population of approximately 50,000 
people, was both a rural mountain town and 
a resort. It harbored fashionable spas and san- 
itariums; particularly notable among the latter 
was one in which Zelda Fitzgerald was treated. 
The narrowness and complacency of ordinary 
rural life was offset by these institutions which, 
incidentally, were a source of support for the 
middle class, to which Noland's family be- 
longed. Noland considers himself fortunate to 
have grown up in a town in the South that 
was at once primitive and sophisticated. 

His grandfather's business was the model for 
the funeral home of Horse Hines in Thomas 
Wolfe's Look Homeward Angel. Although 
neither his mother or father went to college, 
members of his father's family did. His grand- 
father on his mother's side was a blacksmith 
who could make anything— violins, watches 
as well as the wrought iron objects he pro- 
duced for a living. 

At a very early age, all of the Noland chil- 
dren were exposed to art by their mother, an 
amateur musician who played the piano, and 
father, a Sunday painter of landscapes and still- 
lifes who had studied with a woman artist who 
was an Impressionist. When Noland was thir- 
teen or fourteen, he was taken by his father to 
the National Gallery in Washington and he re- 
members being impressed with Monet. His 
father allowed him to use his professional art- 
ist's materials, a rare opportunity for a child. 
He still retains a vivid impression of the sense 



of materials and the materiality of paint he ex- 
perienced at the time. Next to his father, the 
most important influence on the artist in his 
early teens was his brother Harry, four years 
his elder, who introduced him to both jazz and 
literature. Harry, regarded by Kenneth as the 
real intellectual in the family, had been a pho- 
tographer in high school, taught during World 
War II and received his M.A. at the American 
University in Washington, D.C. The youngest 
brother, Neil, is a sculptor who often assists 
Kenneth with many facets of his work. 

In 1942, at the age of eighteen, Noland was 
drafted into the army and elected to serve in 
the Air Force as a glider pilot and cryptogra- 
pher. His decision to join the Air Force was 
prompted, in part, by the example of his father 
who had been an "early bird," one of the first 
one hundred or so who learned to fly (fig.). 
As children, Kenneth Noland and his brothers 
had ridden in these early planes, and the ro- 
manticism he attached to flying from die days 
of these youthful adventures attracted him to 
the Air Force. Although Noland spent most 
of his time in the Air Force in the United States, 
in flyers' pools at numerous air bases, toward 
the end of the War he was stationed in Egypt 
and Turkey (fig.). 

After the War Noland returned to Ashe- 
ville. He had decided to attend art school and 
had heard from his brother Harry about Black 
Mountain College, in Black Mountain, North 
Carolina, which was only twenty miles from 
Asheville. Kenneth, together with his brothers 
Harry and Neil, attended Black Mountain on 
the G.I. Bill. 

Josef Albers, head of the Art Department 
at Black Mountain, was the school's driving 
force. When he arrived at Black Mountain in 



i933&gt; direct from the Bauhaus, Albers brought 
with him an encyclopedic view of twentieth- 
century art that had not before been avail- 
able to even the most avant-garde artists in 
America. Only Hans Hofmann, who had 
opened his own school in New York in 1933, 
had a first-hand experience of the vast range of 
European modernism that rivaled Albers' own 
knowledge. At Black Mountain Albers contin- 
ued to advocate the pedagogical approach of 
the Bauhaus curriculum. Black Mountain be- 
came the fulcrum of avant-garde activities in 
America and included among its faculty such 
singular and diverse personalities as Willem de 
Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Jack Tworkov, 
Buckminster Fuller, Clement Greenberg and 
John Cage. 

Albers was on sabbatical when Noland ar- 
rived in 1946, but he did study with him for 
one semester in 1947. Noland became familiar 
with Albers' color theories and Bauhaus prin- 
ciples in general but ultimately rejected them 
as too rigid and "scientific." During his two 
years, 1946-48, at Black Mountain Noland 
studied primarily with Ilya Bolotowsky, whom 
he credits as being his most important teacher 
there. Noland says "Bolotowsky took us back 
to Impressionism when we were all beginners 
and through Cubism into neo-plastic art and 
Surrealism." 1 Bolotowsky, although involved 
with many concerns similar to Albers' ap- 
peared to Noland to be more open, more 
a humanist than Albers. Yet despite Albers' 
absence during most of Noland's stay at Black 
Mountain and the fact that Noland took 
exception to his doctrinaire teaching, it is un- 
deniable that Albers' influence was all per- 
vasive at the school and surely left its mark on 
Noland. 




Noland, Untitled, 1947. 

Collection Harry and Christa Noland 



At Black Mountain Noland was primarily 
interested in pure abstraction. He has described 
his work of the period to be abstract neo- 
plastic painting of a "Mondrian-Bauhaus" 
orientation as filtered through the influence 
of Bolotowsky and Albers. See, for example, 
Untitled, 1947 (fig.). But it was Bolotowsky, 
rather than Albers, who introduced Noland to 
the expressive possibilities of color. Noland has 
since described Bolotowsky as ". . . coming out 
of Mondrian . . . painted in color." 

Mondrian's influence was undoubtedly con- 
veyed by Bolotowsky, who, as a charter mem- 



ber of the New York based American Abstract 
Artists, a group founded in 1936 and oriented 
towards geometric abstraction, was in touch 
with Mondrian and sympathetic to the artist's 
theories. Robert Motherwell speaks of Mon- 
drian's: "formulation of color relations arising 
from a division of space. He uses color and 
space to communicate feeling ... a definite and 
specific and concrete poetry breaks through his 
bars. . . ." 2 To Mondrian, the function of the 
artist was to express the felt quality of reality 
without referring to the natural forms of the 
outside world. As Mondrian said: 



10 



What capitivated us at first does not hold us 
afterwards. If one has loved the surface of 
things for a long time, one will finally look 
for something more. This "more," however, 
is already present in the surface one wants 
to go beyond. Through the surface one sees 
the inner side of things; it is as we regard 
the surface that the inward image takes 
shape in our souls. This is the image we are 
to represent. For the natural surface of things 
is beautiful, but the imitation of this surface 
is lifeless. Things give us everything, their 
representations give us nothing. 3 

Noland's mature works owe much to Mon- 
drian in their classic purity, chromatic break- 
down of space and the optical effects of forms 
which seem to advance and retreat while simul- 
taneously occupying a single plane. But the dif- 
ferences between the two artists are as apparent 
.is their similarities. In his concentric circle 
paintings, Noland, unlike Mondrian, conveys 
a physical sense of space with expressive brush- 
work, staining, overlapping edges and the illu- 
sion of diminishing forms created by concentric 
bands of color. Noland's concentric circles 
more closely resemble Albers' concentric 
squares (fig.) than they do Mondrian's paint- 
ings in their symmetrical organization and 
their juxtaposition of color. Too, Mondrian's 
restriction of color to white, black and the 
primaries and structuring of the entire surface 
with equal emphasis are antithetical to No- 
land's interests of this period. Rather, the iden- 
tification of and emphasis upon the center of 
the canvas, effected by means of the circle, and 
an expressive and intuitive use of a wide range 
of color assume the greatest importance in 
this, Noland's first mature body of work. No- 



land could best express his color sensibility 
with the circle: it was both a specific and a 
general form. Noland, again unlike Mon- 
drian who limited himself to horizontals, ver- 
ticals and straight edges, loves the irregular 
edge, the diagonal, the curve, the sphere, used 
singularly or combined. Mondrian structured 
asymmetrical compositions within symmetrical 
formats. Noland, however, is fundamentally 
concerned with symmetrical centered organiza- 
tion. Mondrian's paintings are about balanced 
asymmetry; Noland's are about symmetry and 
the center. Although Noland is by no means 
the purist that Mondrian was, the essential 
grid structure of Mondrian's art— the demar- 
cation of the canvas with black bands which 
often stop short of the edge and create a sensa- 
tion of movement in flat space— and the way 
color works within that structure became basic 
components in Noland's own work. Thus, the 
structural function of color became an integral 
part of Noland's painting, a concern which 
could have worked both to his advantage and 
disadvantage. By overemphasizing structure 
and sacrificing his inherent interest in color, 
Noland might evolve into a purely geometric 
painter, but by eschewing formal concerns and 
working exclusively with color he could also 
severely limit his art. Noland had to find his 
very personal and scrupulous equilibrium of 
structure and color. 

The precepts of the Black Mountain pro- 
gram did not help him effect this synthesis. Nor 
did Surrealism, then the pre-eminent artistic 
movement in New York, seem to provide a 
solution. Surrealism, which had enormous im- 
pact on the first generation of the New York 
School of Abstract Expressionism when Albers 
was at Black Mountain, was of little interest in

North Carolina. The artists of the Bauhaus— 
Kandinsky, Klee, Schwitters and, of course, 
Albers himself— absorbed the students of No- 
land's time. Only when John Cage and Merce 
Cunningham were in residence at Black Moun- 
tain, in the summer of 1948, did the Duchamp- 
oriented wing of Dada have any impact on the 
students there— and then it primarily effected 
the work of Robert Rauschenberg. (Rauschen- 
berg, in turn, was later the major conduit of 
neo-Dada to the younger artists of the New 
York School.) Surrealism itself had little direct 
impact at Black Mountain. In New York, the 
Abstract Expressionists cultivated a language 
of signs and symbols which, in Jungian terms, 
were expressions of a "collective unconscious." 
Such leading figures of the New York School 
as Gorky, Pollock, Rothko, Newman, Gott- 
lieb and Still, among others, developed a body 
of primitive imagery which they believed had 
universal significance. They substituted these 
symbols for the Surrealists' Freudian dream 
imagery. Gottlieb and Rothko, working closely 
together in the 1940's, dedicated themselves to 
the development of mythic content in their 
paintings. Removed from their primitive con- 
text, however, the Abstract Expressionists' 
symbols lost the connective tissue crucial to 
their original meaning and use; they became, 
instead, virtually abstract signs without mythic 
significance. It is interesting to speculate that 
the Abstract Expressionists actually were 
moved to introduce primitive forms for their 
formal rather than their mythical values. 
Indeed, after a relatively brief period of experi- 
mentation, all of the artists in question aban- 
doned mythical signs for a virtually abstract 
imagery. 

Like the Surrealists before them, the Abstract 



Expressionists practiced automatism, a tech- 
nique that encouraged the creation of chance 
and random or spontaneous images free from 
"thought's control." It was this method of 
improvisation that liberated artists like Jack- 
son Pollock from the constraints of traditional 
painting. For Noland, however, the painterly 
possibilities of automatism which were later 
to prove attractive to him were remote at the 
time, and only later did the influence of Pol- 
lock's automatism affect him directly. Removed 
from New York and uninterested in the liter- 
ary and representational aspects of Surrealism, 
unaware of the historic breakthrough of the 
New York School, Noland turned to the one 
painter of the Bauhaus whose genius as a color- 
ist, use of Cubism in an expressive yet still ab- 
stract manner and proto-Surreal fantasy images 
could capture his imagination — Paul Klee. 

Like Mondrian, Klee had sought in abstrac- 
tion a way of reaching beyond the surface of 
natural phenomena. As it was for Mondrian, 
geometry for Klee became the means by which 
he could reduce natural phenomena to a few 
fundamental elements— point, line, plane, solid, 
sphere — and reconcile these basic forms with 
a belief in a highly metaphysical truth. Klee 
rarely painted pure abstractions, however. 
Mondrian's impassioned regard for the strin- 
gencies of a totally abstract system of horizon- 
tals and verticals was alien to Klee, for his work 
always remained rooted in nature. While Mon- 
drian's oeuvre is marked by a singularity of 
concept, Klee's is exceptionally varied stylistic- 
ally. Klee was a romantic and a mystic, and his 
work differs from the organized intellectual 
and literary programs of the Dadaists and Sur- 
realists: his imagery springs from his own in- 
ner, very personal vision. 



Color had a very special function for Klee: he 
used it not as the means of establishing spatial 
illusionism — as Albers did, for example— but 
to convey mood. Once Klee had discovered 
what the true meaning of color was for him, 
he noted in his diary on April 16, 1914: 

/ now abandon work. It penetrates so deeply 
and so gently into me, I feel it and it gives me 
confidence in myself without effort. Color 
possesses me. I don't have to pursue it. It will 
possess me always, 1 know it. That is the 
meaning of this happy hour: Color and I are 
one. I am a painter. 4 

Mondrian's "concrete poetry" and Klee's in- 
tuitive and magical sense of color were the basic 
influences on Noland's painting of this time. 
But the metaphysics of Mondrian and Klee and 
the mythic content of the early Abstract Ex- 
pressionists were alien to the sensibilities of No- 
land and other painters of his generation. Only 
somewhat later, when he was introduced to the 
work of Jackson Pollock, was Noland drawn 
to more active paint handling, a more visceral 
concern for the very process of making a paint- 
ing that led to his own breakthrough. 

In the Fall of 1948 Noland took advantage 
of the G.I. Bill to visit Paris "to find out more 
about art" and to study with the sculptor Ossip 
Zadkine, who had taught at Black Mountain 
College in 1945 before Noland was there. Zad- 
kine was teaching at the Academie de la Grande 
Chaumiere but also gave small private classes 
in his studio which Noland attended. Noland 
made sculpture in class but also rented rooms 
in a series of small pensions in Paris— in the 
Hotel Stanislav, rue Stanislav, rue Fleurus, 
near Gertrude Stein, and rue d'Assas— where he 
lived and painted on his own, with Zadkine's 



12 



criticism and advice. Noland thought that Zad- 
kinc, like Bolotowsky, was ". . . very committed 
to art and very idealistic about teaching and a 
very, very generous sympathetic man." Zad- 
kine's strong Cubist orientation proved prob- 
lematical to Noland, however, as it conflicted 
with the formal training in abstraction he had 
received at Black Mountain and was, even at 
this early stage in his development, antithetical 
to his innate sensibility. 

In Paris Noland became friendly with a few 
artists, notably Arthur Secunda, who intro- 
duced him to William Rubin, then studying 
musicology, and Shinkichi Tajiri and Paul En- 
gland, the latter also a student of Zadkine. En- 
gland had been given a one-man exhibition at 
the Galerie Creuze and helped arrange No- 
land's own show there in the Spring of 1949. 
Although there were many other Americans in 
Paris on the G.I. Bill at that time — including 
Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, Sam Fran- 
cis, Jules Olitski and Paul Jenkins— Noland did 
not get to know them until well after his return 
to the States. Noland's exhibition at Creuze 
consisted of paintings done in Paris which con- 
tinued to reflect the influence of Klee. Although 
Noland felt that public reaction to this show 
was essentially non-existent, in a review in the 
April 29, 1949 issue of the International Herald 
Tribune, "Art News in Paris," the critic John 
Devoluy noted the artist's strength as a colorist, 
citing his ". . . almost barbaric color arrange- 
ments combined with 'graffiti' suggesting ani- 
mals, huts and/or cathedrals." Noland has 
stated that the show was important to him, 
even though it did not reach a wide audience, 
because it allowed him to see his pictures hung 
publicly in an exhibition space instead of in his 
studio. 



In Paris Noland became aware of Matisse. 
Matisse's impact on Noland's early work, es- 
pecially in the area of color, became as signifi- 
cant as that of Klee. As Noland has stated: 

/ got onto Matisse when I was in Paris and 
realized that I was going to have to revise 
my thinking about how to go about making 
pictures. Up until that time . . . it was com- 
ing out of abstract art of the Bauhaus-Cubist 
kind, and I realized that I had to really learn 
how to paint. I think it has something to do 
very simply with how to use materials in a 
kind of hand way. The Cubist abstract way 
of painting was more like a process of pre- 
disposition, like you planned and you con- 
ceived it beforehand. To paint out of 
Matisse, or to use color, you had to learn 
how to use the materials. 

To organize an abstract painting, Noland 
believed that it was necessary to reject Cubist 
structure, which was essentially graphic and 
was based on light and dark and which even 
Mondrian had been unable to discard. His 
ambition was to transform a graphic structure 
into a color structure, with Matisse and Klee 
his masters. He was drawn to Miro's abstract 
forms, handling of materials and tactility. In 
an attempt to free himself from Bolotowsky, 
Albers and Mondrian, he painted some Picas- 
soesque post-Cubist neo-classical figures and 
Matisse-like still-lifes. 

After a stay of only a year in Paris Noland 
was anxious to return to the States. Like most 
Americans in France at the time, he did not get 
much involved with French cultural life. He 
felt that the Americans, unlike the French art 
students, wanted to find out about European 
art without actually continuing in its tradition. 



Moreover, many of the best European artists 
had been in the United States during the War. 
He thought that: 

There was no life really going on in art ... 1 
just had an idea that there was more going 
on in the United States. 1 wanted to get back 
to see what was going on over here . . . they 
knew about Picasso very much and about 
Matisse and Mho. But they knew nothing 
about Paul Klee or Mondrian. And over here 
we had known about Mondrian and Klee 
and assumed that they were of equal stature 
with the so-called French School of paint i&gt;ig. 

In any event, he felt that his exposure to ab- 
straction at Black Mountain had prepared him 
for a more radical form of art than existed in 
Paris. He returned to the States in the sum- 
mer of 1949 and moved to Washington, D.C., 
where his parents were living, and remained 
there until 1961. 

In the Fall of 1949-50 he began to work at 
the Institute of Contemporary Arts, first as a 
student-teacher under the G.I. Bill and then 
full time, teaching painting and drawing. This 
job enabled him to support himself and to 
continue to paint. His teacher at the ICA was 
an Englishman, Robin Bond, who had taught 
at the A. S. Neil School at Summerhill and was 
influential in developing interest in art and art 
education in Washington. When Bond left the 
ICA, Noland took over his job. Noland was 
indebted to Bond for encouraging his interest 
in Klee and for introducing him to Reichian 
therapy. Noland remained in Reichian treat- 
ment for about nine years; he stresses the im- 
portance of this and subsequent therapy on his 
life and on the development of his work, for he 
feels strongly that art, no matter how abstract,

reflects one's view and experience of life and 
people. 

Noland's interest in Klee was reinforced by 
frequent visits to the Klee room at the Phillips 
Collection in Washington. And his painting of 
this period continued to reflect Klee's influ- 
ence, which is especially evident in works like 
In the Garden, c. 1952 and Untitled, 1951-52. 
(figs.). The latter, in particular, is more than 
casually related to Klee's Rolling Landscape, 
1938 (fig.). Noland's innate feeling for the cir- 
cle and the center is noticeable in a Klee-like 
painting such as Untitled, 1950 (fig.). Klee's 
Arab Song (fig.) is significant in part for the 



example it presented to Noland of centered 
shapes. The organization of a minimum num- 
ber of forms for maximum effect is paralleled 
in Noland's own later work. But even more 
important for Noland is Klee's extraordinary 
color sense, unparalleled among his contempo- 
raries, with the singular exception of Matisse. 
The juxtaposition of Arab Song's soft but lu- 
minous pastels, the use of a single narrow 
band of black in the upper third of the paint- 
ing as counterpoint to these tones, and the 
obvious texture of the burlap support are 
adapted with stunning results in Noland's bril- 
liant circle paintings in the late 1950's. Noland 



also consciously adapted Klee's materials such 
as watercolor and pastel and the highly tex- 
tured often coarse supports which emphasized 
the physicality so important to him. His devel- 
oping passion for color was encouraged by 
other painters he saw at the Phillips Collection: 
there Noland viewed with interest the percept- 
ual and optical effects of the Impressionists 
and was especially taken with the American 
painter Augustus Vincent Tack. 

Noland spent the summer of 1950 at Black 
Mountain College, where he met and became 
friendly with Paul Goodman, who taught writ- 
ing, and Clement Greenberg, with whom he

developed a close friendship. He also met Helen 
Frankenthaler who was visiting for a few days. 
Frankenthaler, who was studying with Hans 
Hofmann in Provincetown, was Noland's only 
personal link to New York Abstract Expression- 
ism at the time. She did not, however, directly 
influence Noland's work during this period as 
he continued to absorb the impact of Klee. 

Later that year Noland met David Smith 
through Cornelia Langer, once Smith's student 
at Sarah Lawrence. The close friendship that 
developed between the two artists lasted until 
the sculptor's death in 1965. Their relation- 
ship was reinforced by Cornelia's marriage to 
Noland and her own friendship with Smith's 
second wife, Jean Freas. From Smith Noland 
learned the value of working in series and keep- 
ing large quantities of materials at hand so 
that he would feel free to experiment with 
them. Noland began to draw intensively in 
both abstract and figurative modes: many of 
the drawings reflect Smith's influence. At about 
this time Noland began to recognize Pollock's 
importance and to introduce elements of this 
painter's work into his Klee-like canvases, as 
in Untitled, c. 1952-53 (fig.). Pollock's Eyes in 
the Heat, of 1946 (fig.), was especially impor- 
tant to Noland, not for its inherent Surrealist 
imagery or mythic symbolism, which are re- 
lated to Klee's whimsical ideograms, but for its 
gestural emphasis which revealed the process 
of the act of painting. Noland has stated that 
his ambition was to create a new kind of 
abstract painting. He had already abandoned 
Cubist graphic structure and dark and light 
values and had evolved a language of color out 
of Matisse and Klee. The freedom, heroic scale 
and the replacement of drawing by gesture of 
Pollock's work would ultimately provide No-

land with the final elements he needed to syn- 
thesize his new and utterly unique expression. 

The ICA dissolved around 1951, and the 
ceramicist Alexander Giampietro, who had 
taught at both the ICA and Catholic Univer- 
sity, helped Noland obtain a job at the latter 
institution. Noland worked there for about 
nine years, primarily teaching figure drawing 
and fundamentals of design. In addition to his 
job at Catholic University, in order to be able 
to support his family and still continue paint- 
ing, Noland taught night classes intermittently 
from 1952 to 1956 at the Washington Work- 
shop Center of the Arts. 

In 1952 Noland met Morris Louis when both 
began to teach at the Workshop Center at 
about the same time. They formed a very close 
relationship that broke off in 1955 but was 
resumed about one and one-half years before 
Louis' death in 1962. Noland and Louis saw 
each other frequently, generally two or three 
times a week, talked a lot and became "paint- 
ing buddies." 

When I first met Morris he was very inter- 
ested in Jackson Pollock, and so was I. . . . 
He had arrived at this independently. I had 
arrived at it mostly through having had con- 
tact with Clement Grecnberg. There was 
idealism, personal idealism kind of involved 
in that. ... By comparisons and by discus- 
sion and so forth it was mutually benefitting. 

During a visit to New York in early April 
of 1953, Noland introduced Louis to Green- 
berg, who took them to Helen Frankenthaler's 
studio. There they saw her 1952 poured stain 
painting Mountains and Sea (fig.), among 
others. Noland and Louis were deeply im- 
pressed by her work. Noland later spoke of the

experience as follows: "We were interested in 
Pollock but could gain no lead to him. He was 
too personal. But Frankenthaler showed us a 
way — a way to think about, and use color." 5 
Upon their return to Washington, Noland and 
Louis experimented together with staining with 
color directly into raw canvas for a period of 
two or three weeks, sometimes even working 
on the same painting. After this intense period 
of joint experimentation, which Louis and No- 
land called "jam painting," they began work- 
ing again on their own.

Starting in 1953 Greenberg and David Smith 
visited Washington about two or three times a 
year. They got together at various times with 
Noland and Louis to talk about art. The friend- 
ships that formed had a profound influence on 
Noland, who was considerably younger than 
the others. Noland also went to New York 
whenever he could, visiting about twice a year, 
sometimes in the company of Louis. In New 
York Greenberg took Noland to see paintings 
and to parties and introduced him to many of 
the major New York School artists.

Harry and Christa Noland 



In 1953-54 Noland began to experiment 
with plastic-based rather than oil paints. He 
started to use Magna, which is compatible with 
oil but has acrylic-resin as a binding agent. 
When they met, Louis had already been using 
Magna, which he had obtained from his friend, 
Leonard Bocour. Indeed, Louis was the first 
artist to stain with Magna. At this time No- 
land also began to mix dry pigment, given to 
him by David Smith, with water-based plastic 
mediums. This kind of mixture was later com- 
mercially manufactured under various names 
such as Aqua-Tec and Liquitex. However, No- 



land primarily used Magna until 1962, when 
he changed to Aqua-Tec. Noland began to 
favor acrylic-based paint because it is possible 
to stain it directly into raw canvas— at this time 
he was using cotton duck— without the prim- 
ing essential when employing oil paint. The 
stain technique and the nature of the medium 
had important ramifications. The method made 
it difficult for Noland to alter or re-work a 
color since it caused the paint quality to change. 
It was this fact that later led Noland to describe 
his canvases as "one-shot" paintings. Process 
was to become a vital component of Noland's 



paintings, even more essential than in Pollock, 
in that Noland's process must work completely 
if the image is not to fail -entirely. If the tech- 
nique and image did fail, the paintings were 
discarded. 

Noland's paintings of the years 1953-56 are 
characterized by continual experimentation. 
He tried both a de Kooningesque Abstract Ex- 
pressionism and the stain technique that had 
so impressed him in New York. But there was 
too much for the young Noland to successfully 
assimilate into his work at this early date, and 
his paintings of the time demonstrate no dra- 



matic breakthrough (fig.)- The more mature 
Louis, however, shortly thereafter began to 
evolve his brilliant series of Veils, of which an 
early example is Breaking Hue, 1954 (fig.)- No- 
land produced abstractions with all-over Pol- 
lock-like articulation, canvases with landscape 
feeling like those of Frankenthaler and works 
that show the influence of Still or Rothko. Paint 
is applied thickly with the brush or fingers; 
paint is poured or stained in thin washes. In 
searching for new ways to apply paint, organ- 
ize the surface and escape the limitations of 
previous abstraction, Noland was trying to dis- 
cover his personal style. In this respect, Noland 
has acknowledged that living in Washington 
helped him as well as Louis; their distance 
from New York gave them perspective on the 
de Kooning- type of Abstract Expressionism 
dominant there. Noland's position in Wash- 
ington allowed him to remain cognizant of 
what was happening in New York yet realize 
that he did not wish to paint in the manner 
of his contemporaries there. His detachment 
prompted him to experiment and ultimately de- 
velop his own independent expression. Noland 
explained his and Louis' reservations about 
Abstract Expressionism; 

. . . the thing that bothered me about the Ab- 
stract Expressionists, or bothered me about 
the way fainting had been, was the fact that 
painters had usually gotten set in a way of 
working. . . . We figured that the best way to 
arrive at making art that was more personal 
was to get into a process of changing. . . . 
that was a lesson we learned from Abstract 
Expressionism: that we used to make changes 
and so learned to recognize that not just 
changing from one picture to another pic-

lure, but the necessity for at some point 
throwing everything into question and going 
back to the necessity to just re-handle the 
materials again. 

By this time, Noland's work was included in a 
number of seminal group shows. For example, 
Greenberg visited Washington and selected 
three paintings by Louis and one by Noland for 
a group exhibition, Emerging Talent, which he 
was organizing for the Kootz Gallery in New 
York, held in January 1954. Besides Noland and 
Louis, the other participants in the exhibi- 
tion were Herman Cherry, Paul Feeley, Paul 
Georges, Cornelia Langer, Saul Leiter, An- 
thony Louvis, Sue Mitchell, Philip Pearlstein, 
and Theophil Repke. On a visit to New York 
Noland took several paintings to the Poin- 
dcxter Gallery. Betty Parsons called them to 
Dorothy Miller's attention. Dorothy Miller se- 
lected Noland's In a Mist (fig.) for The 
Museum of Modern Art's traveling exhibition, 
Young American Painters, which circulated in 
the United States from 1956 to 1958. Other 
artists in the show included Richard Dieben- 
korn, Fllsworth Kelly, Elaine de Kooning, Ste- 
phen Pace and Sam Francis. 

Noland's circle paintings had begun to 
emerge gradually by 1956, when the Modern's 
show started its circulation. Even in an ex- 
tremely gestural work like Untitled, c. 1956 
(fig.), Noland's sense of the center is apparent. 
A painting like Globe, 1956 (cat. no. 3), reveals 
characteristic features of the circle series: a 
square support contains a centered circle sur- 
rounded by washes of color and a large amount 
of raw canvas. Although this painting is still 
largely expressionistic and lacks definition in 
the jagged contour of the circle and the uncer- 



tain choice of color, both circular motif and 
square format are harbingers of a new direc- 
tion in Noland's work. The circle as a motif 
and square canvas as a format are beginning to 
assume greater urgency. Expressionist features 
are increasingly suppressed, despite Noland's 
lingering need to allow the process of pouring 
and staining an active and highly emotional 
presence in his painting and to avoid at all 
costs the rigid geometry of Albers. 

Clearly, the circle was a much more satisfy- 
ing form than the square for Noland. The circle 
is related to the cosmos, while the square is 
most closely associated with man and man- 
made forms like architecture. The circle stands 
for eternity, the square, a symbol of the four 
elements in ancient times, represents material- 
ity and infinity. Because it has neither begin- 
ning nor end, the circle has, since antiquity, 
been symbolic of natural phenomena, organic 
growth, mysticism and divinity. One of the 
oldest of mathematical figures, the circle has 
been used in architecture since prehistoric 
times (in prehistoric huts, Moslem arches, 
Claude-Nicolas Ledoux' spheres and Buck- 
minster Fuller's geodesic domes); in religion, 
for example, as a symbol of totality and in the 
form of the mandala. It occurs in nature, as in 
the growth rings of a tree. 

Whereas the square is essentially a static 
figure (unless turned on end to form a dia- 
mond), the circle is dynamic. Any equilibrium 
the circle maintains is dependent upon second- 
ary elements: a dot or circle placed at exact 
center creates a sensation of stasis; motion and 
countermotion are inferred by another circle 
placed off center within a symmetrical form. 
Concentric rings create a pattern of energy in 
which movement radiates from the interior to 



the exterior of the circles. Color is, of course, a 
vital factor which can enhance or alter the 
optical effects of motion in circles. Newton, 
Maxwell and Duchamp, among others, ex- 
perimented with color and discs. Their inves- 
tigations, as well as others', reinforce the prem- 
ise that the circle, in itself, infers motion. No- 
land wishes to infer rotary (that is, spinning) 
movement, while maintaining color equilib- 
rium. He explains that he puts the soft or 
ragged painting on the outer band to make the 
transition to the outer canvas surface gradual 
instead of abrupt, to cushion the intensity of 
the color on the canvas. This concern is unique 
and is opposite in intent and effect from that of 
Albers, who used the square to maintain a static 
balance and interacting color to create illusory 
motion. Noland appears in this connection to 
have been impressed by Kandinsky's color 
theories as expressed in his Concerning the 
Spiritual in Art, Kandinsky had concluded that 
certain colors, such as blue, recede, while 
others, such as yellow, advance, despite the 
fact that they may fill equal areas — for ex- 
ample, a circle. Kandinsky did not concentrate 
on the mechanics of motion but rather on the 
metaphysics of form and color. Noland was 
able to derive from these and other theories 
of early twentieth-century abstraction the 
realization of an elemental form as a sublime 
reality. 

Noland's first one-man exhibition in New 
York was held at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery 
in 1957, when he was thirty-three. Noland was 
bringing paintings to New York around this 
time in search of a gallery, and Helen Franken- 
thaler, who was showing at de Nagy, "put in a 
good word" for him. James Schuyler described 
the show in Art News: 



21 



Noland's first one-man show of oils in New 
York was a breath of spring in the depths of 
winter. For instance, Bedspread: a smeared 
white cloud, flat and dense, fringed at bot- 
tom by black strokes, at the top by blue and 
white, on either side by a band of green of 
willows about to leaf. Globe eliminated the 
middle plane: a black circle that did not 
quite join floated free of the canvas, stained 
and freckled with the clear diffusion of peb- 
bles under water. Elmer's Tune was divided 
into three panels whose summing up was a 
continuous appeal to the eye, not to the 
ruler. And Opal, with drawn twinges (or 
tweaks) under the thin washes of oil: birds 
flying: refractions in a milk opal: opal chips 
floating in glycerine. The show satisfied any 
criteria for the Abstract-Impressionist mode 
and for tune detectives, the influences were 
there to detect. But the best tune was No- 
land's own, changing from painting to 
painting, always musical to the eye, like the 
stream of warmed silver paint in his Royal 
Envelope/' 

Other critics noted Noland's distinctive use 
of color; one cited combinations of ". . . green, 
pinkish gray and electric blue . . . milky, 
overlapping tints of blues, pinks, purples and 
greens. . . ." 7 

Shortly thereafter Noland began his concen- 
tric circle paintings, which are generally con- 
sidered to be his first mature works. By 1957-58 
he had gradually eschewed painterliness in fa- 
vor of hard-edged, centered motifs such as 
discs, cruciform patterns, lozenge shapes. The 
paintings of 1958-59 feature concentric bands 
of color of varying widths which appear to 
move outward from the canvas center to its

edges. Canvas is left unpaintcd along the edges 
of the support as well as in bare bands between 
the painted bands of the circles. Until 1961 the 
outer band of the circle often retains an uneven 
painterly edge reminiscent of Abstract Expres- 
sionist gesture, as in That, 1958-59 (cat. no. 9). 
This trail of freehand brush drawing at the 
outermost ring is rendered by staining without 
impasto. Occasionally paintings of this period 
feature stars, crosses, for example, William, 

1 960 (cat. no. 19), pinwhcels, as in Corn Sweet, 

1961 (cat. no. 20), or armature-like motifs, but 
the circles dominate. Noland painted a few 
canvases with a centered floral motif, for ex- 
ample, Time's Motion, 1959 (cat. no. 13), 
which were influenced by Louis' Veils. How- 
ever, they preceded Louis' Florals, begun in 
i960, and probably influenced them. Green- 
berg was of the opinion that Louis' "art would 
have evolved anyhow . . . towards intenser and 
more opaque color, and vertical stripings were 
already emerging from under his 'veils' in the 
years previous. Noland's influence served, how- 
ever, to speed their emergence. . . ." 8 

When Noland began his first important 
works, the concentric circles, he moved ahead 
of Louis in several major respects, not the least 
of which was in the realm of technique. Louis 
had shown Noland how to lay down a thin size 
and minimize the use of a ground; but Noland 
was the first to employ unsized canvas, a prac- 
tice Louis adapted in his Floral series. Even 
more significant was Noland's breakthrough 
in the area of color. Value remained an intrin- 
sic feature of Louis' work at this time. In that 
Louis was involved with value as well as color 
and structure, he relates to Pollock, Picasso, 
Cezanne. Noland, however, eliminated value 
in favor of an exclusive concern with color and 



structure. It seems evident that Matisse figured 
prominently in this aspect of his development. 
Matisse's hedonistic color sensibility— his jux- 
taposition of pure vibrant color into separate 
but contiguous zones — inspired Noland to 
strengthen his own palette: he was thus able to 
reinforce Klee-like delicate nuance with Ma- 
tisse-like intensity. Although Noland had been 
an avid admirer of Matisse from his early days 
in Paris, he was not as quick to absorb the 
French master's lessons as he was to learn from 
Klee. There were no doubt several reasons for 
this, the most important of which probably 
was that Matisse's color was bound to lines, 
shapes and contours of representational form. 
This was a problem for Noland because he 
wanted to eliminate the vestigial elements of 
drawing and representation in his painting. 
However, he was able to adapt Matisse's color 
without its concomitant drawing when he dis- 
covered the concentric circle, a neutral form 
which he could shape by means of color alone. 
Noland's working method at this time has 
been described as follows: 

. . . sometimes he would start to work di- 
rectly on the canvas or sometimes he would 
begin by mixing up about 40 jars of Magna. 
. . . Then he would dip a Q-Tip into some 
jars and put some rings of color down on 
paper. This enabled him to see color rela- 
tions. From there he went to the paintings. 
Six foot paintings were made on sawhorses, 
larger ones on the floor. After marking the 
center of the paintings, he used circular 
shapes such as dinner plates or hoops to 
draw the rings in pencil. The rings were 
painted free-hand with brushes. The center 
one was always painted first. 9 



Several writers have described Noland "dis- 
covering the center" one day while walking 
around one of his canvases which was on the 
floor, where, like Pollock, he often worked. Pol- 
lock and the Abstract Expressionists in general 
were fundamentally concerned with all-over 
painting. Noland, however, in a radical break 
with this tradition, rejected even surface articu- 
lation and instead emphasized the center of the 
canvas. This dramatic innovation became a 
basic component of his work. The circle was, 
of course, the ideal form with which to focus 
on the center. 

In October of 1959 Noland showed a group 
of concentric circle paintings for the first time 
in his one-man exhibition at French and Com- 
pany in New York. Greenberg, who had be- 
come artistic advisor to the gallery in 1958, 
helped Noland choose and hang the show. 
Among the paintings in the exhibition were 
Ex-Nihilo, 1958, cat. no. 7), and Lunar Epi- 
sode, 1959 (cat. no. 10), which illustrate the 
progression of his development: the later can- 
vas is far more defined than the earlier. Noland 
also experimented with double circles which 
closely resemble one another in format but not 
color. He later cut these in half, for example, 
This and That (cat. no. 9), Half and And Half. 
In Alliance (fig.), Noland again used a double 
circle motif, but here the circles do not resem- 
ble one another and, in fact, appear to owe a 
certain debt to Adolph Gottlieb's "burst" con- 
figurations, which he would have known by 
this time. Noland also experimented briefly 
with the tondo format, eliminating the outer 
corners of a few circle paintings, for example, 
Tondo, 1958-59 (fig.). His use of the tondo was 
by no means unique— Robert Delaunay had 
employed it in such works as Disc, 1912., Bolo-

towsky and later Frank Stella in his protractor 
series experimented with this form, as had No- 
land himself in the early 1950's. Eliminating 
the corners of the canvas did not satisfy No- 
land, for he wished to identify the frontality 
and flatness of the image in relation to the pic- 
ture plane. He was not interested in making 
an object out of the image by building out the 
painting's surface or playing on different levels 
of reality, as Johns had in his targets and flags, 
or by identifying the image with the support, 
as Stella had in his black paintings. The first 
time Noland had seen a Johns target, Target 
with Four Faces (fig.), was in reproduction on 
the cover of Art News in January 1958, and he 
later saw others at Castelli in 1959; he also saw 
Stella black paintings in 1959. He rejected 
these alternatives and instead concerned him- 
self totally with flatness, achieved not by shap- 
ing the canvas but by enlarging the circle as 
much as possible within the limits dictated by 
the square canvas. The dimensions of the sup- 
port were generally based on a six by six foot 
module. However, the actual size was deter- 
mined after the painting was stretched. The 
final proportions were sometimes, but not al- 
ways, perfectly square. That Noland was able 
to make highly successful and explicit state- 
ments about flatness and still retain the impact 
of his image and the originality and expressive- 
ness of his color is illustrated in paintings like 
Turnsole, 1961 (cat. no. 22) and Spring Cool, 
1962 (cat. no. 26). 

Noland continually experimented with 
color, technique and variations on the circle 
motif. For example, in Circle, 1958 (cat. no. 4), 
.\nc\ Virginia Site, 1959 (cat. no. 14), color is 
highly saturated and extremely dense, but in 
Spring Cool and Turnsole, color is "layed 



back," restricted in saturation and limited to a 
few narrow bands. Spaces between bands are 
enlarged and the outside band of the circle al- 
most touches the canvas edge. Thus the inert 
wedges of raw canvas left by the earlier cen- 
tered circles are eliminated and the problem of 
figure-ground relationship is solved. The two 
earlier paintings have a dense inner center and 
an active outer edge which cause the image to 
seem to spin centrifugally, a characteristic of 
the canvases of 1958-60. However, Noland 
creates an entirely different effect in works 
of 1961-62., such as Spring Cool and Eyre (cat. 
no. 27). Here the illusion conveyed is of cen- 
tripetal movement activated by a relatively 
small center, as a pebble produces ripples in a 
pond. In these later paintings, Noland sets up a 
series of color contrasts which charge the en- 
tire surface of the canvas. He was later to adapt 
this device most effectively in such all-over 
horizontal stripe paintings as Via Tradewind, 
1968 (cat. no. 80), and Via Lime, 1968-69 (cat. 
no. 90). 

In 1962 Noland began his cat's-eye pictures, 
in which his concentric rings are replaced by an 
ellipsoid or oval which as a rule contains a 
smaller oval or circle as in New Problem, 1962 
(cat. no. 25). These motifs, which almost reach 
the sides of the support, are oriented horizon- 
tally or vertically and are at first placed in the 
middle of square canvas field. Soon, however, 
Noland reduced the size of the motif. Subse- 
quently he placed the shape above or below the 
painting's central horizontal axis. He con- 
tinued to center various unusual symmetrical 
forms, such as diamonds which contain circu- 
lar motifs, or to symmetrically dispose curved 
shapes near the edges of a square canvas (figs.). 
He had begun painting in the sides and corners

of the circle works in 1961 but often left areas 
of unpainted canvas in the rings of the circle 
itself. Now, however, in the cat's-eye paintings, 
the entire surface is covered with paint, flooded 
with a single color. In the cat's-eye canvases a 
lozenge-like shape is integrated into a larger 
field: in this respect these paintings bear an af- 
finity to the work of Barnett Newman. Noland 
maintains that he had not seen any of New- 
man's work before 1959 and then only in 
reproduction. To be sure, Newman only oc- 
casionally used circular motifs in his earlier 
work, as in Pagan Void, 1946 (fig.), and it was 
the introduction of the "zip" or vertical stripe, 
not the circle, onto a large field that became his 
central obsession. 



Although Newman had attempted to use a 
centered stripe in such paintings as Onement 1, 
1948 (fig.), it tended to restrict the spatial im- 
plications of his work by bisecting and flatten- 
ing—or neutralizing— the surface, and he 
moved his "zips" off-center in order to activate 
the entire canvas. Because Newman's stripe 
was often fudged at the edge, it created a sensa- 
tion of advancing and retreating space while 
simultaneously asserting the totality of the 
field. Newman usually restricted his palette to 
one or two colors— rarely did he use as many 
as three— and in general sacrificed color to 
space. For space, the "arena" of the New York 
School, rooted in metaphysics, was the basic 
component of Newman's art. But color was 



Noland's prime concern. Noland pioneered in 
the use of color as area, color as sensation, 
color as a tangible entity, color without a mys- 
tique, color as the very basis of painting. 

Nevertheless, the cat's-eye paintings clearly 
reveal an important, albeit indirect debt to 
Newman. To a lesser extent, in their painterli- 
ness and the placement of their motifs, they 
also reflect Noland's awareness of Rothko and 
Gottlieb. The examples of Rothko, Gottlieb 
and Still, as well as Newman, encouraged No- 
land's aspirations and confirmed his feelings 
about abstract art. Noland, like many young 
artists maturing in the late 1950's and early 
1960's, felt a distinct kinship as well as a healthy 
rivalry with Newman. Although the cat's-eye 



26

paintings do not outwardly resemble New- 
man's canvases, Noland restricts his palette in 
them, as Newman did, and moves the relatively 
quiescent cat's-eye motif around the painting, 
from direct center to the top or bottom reg- 
isters of the canvas, much as Newman moved 
the zip across the length of his field. Although 
the cat's-eye paintings lack both the expres- 
sionistic vitality and optical vibrations of the 
earlier circle paintings, they radiate a quiet 
self-confidence, an aura of detachment and 
luminosity that recalls the work of the first 
generation of the New York School at its best. 
In the spring of 1961 Noland moved from 
Washington to the Chelsea Hotel in New York. 
At the Chelsea he began to experiment with a 



chevron-shaped motif, and by 1963 his chev- 
ron series emerged. In these works V-shaped 
bands of color fan out symmetrically from a 
central vertical axis. The organizational focus 
shifts from the center or near-center of the can- 
vas, where most of his other motifs were 
placed, to mid-point of the bottom edge of the 
picture, where the tips of the early chevrons are 
anchored. The chevrons mark a dramatic shift 
for Noland from the curved edges of circles 
and ovals to the straight edge. Examples of 
such early chevrons are Dusk and Sun Dried: 
Japanese Space, both 1963 (cat. nos. 31, 34). In 
some chevrons of the period, for example, Blue 
Horizon and East West, both 1963 (cat. nos. 
30, 32.), the tips and sides of the outer bands of

the motif are cut off by the bottom and sides of 
the canvas: the chevron thus does not appear to 
spring from the bottom center of the canvas. 
And we do not seem to perceive the entire 
motif, but rather a portion of it which is deter- 
mined by the shape and size of the support. 

The chevrons may have been influenced by 
Louis' use of the diagonal in his Unfurls (for 
example, Alpha Pi, fig.), which preceded them. 
If they were inspired by Louis, Noland's chev- 
rons are nevertheless characteristically original, 
a brilliant series of paintings in which he reas- 
serts centrality and symmetry. Louis' Pollock- 
like meandering diagonal ribbons of color 
cascading down the sides of the canvas are far 
less assertive, less structured than Noland's de- 



finitely shaped Vs. Indeed, Noland's regard for 
structure, apparent from the time of the first 
circle paintings, is nowhere more evident than 
in his chevron series. These chevrons are inter- 
esting in comparison to Louis and Stella. 
They reveal that Noland, like Mondrian and 
Matisse, conceives of color as area and is not 
nearly as dependent upon Pollock's method of 
paint application as Louis was. Although the 
configurations in Stella's paintings of 1963, 
such as Valparaiso Red (fig.), bear a startling 
resemblance to the atypical double V-shaped 
motif of Noland's Passage, 1963 (fig.), they are, 
however, based on an entirely different ap- 
proach. Stella shapes the edge of Valparaiso 
Red to conform to the configuration of his 



triple V, but Noland's chevrons are so thor- 
oughly integrated with the square or rectangle 
of the support they always remain two-dimen- 
sional motifs on flat surfaces: they never take 
on the object-quality, with all its concomitant 
problems, of Stella's shaped canvases. 

After the first chevrons, Noland made cer- 
tain changes: he began to suspend the bands 
from the upper right and left-hand corners of 
the support and raise their tips above the bot- 
tom edge of the canvas so that the motif no 
longer covered the entire field. As a result of 
this new formulation, unpainted areas are left 
in the bottom corners of the picture, and raw 
canvas re-emerges as a prominent feature in 
Noland's work. The elimination of the paint-

erly gesture which characterized the circles in 
favor of more incisive shape and more intense 
impacted color in the chevrons represents a 
new departure for Noland. Noland's color now 
became stronger perhaps in response to the ag- 
gressiveness of New York painting of the early 
1960's. His colors, at maximum intensity, 
aligned one next to another, are tightly locked 
within the bands of the chevron, subject to the 
pressure of the contiguous areas of raw canvas 
and the rectangular support. Shape in the chev- 
rons, as in all phases of Noland's work, is an 
extremely important element; its primary func- 
tion, however, is to serve as a vehicle for color 
expression. 

Noland bought Robert Frost's farm in South 
Shaftsbury, Vermont, in 1963. He had been 



looking for a place outside New York for 
about three years, and the thought of living near 
David Smith at Bolton Landing, ninety minutes 
away, pleased him. His decision to leave New 
York was prompted in part by Smith's ex- 
ample, and his choice of location was in- 
fluenced also by the fact that Bennington 
College, with its stimulating social and cultural 
milieu, was nearby. This move, in turn, affected 
Anthony Caro, whom Noland had met and be- 
come friendly with in 1959: Caro decided to 
move his wife Sheila and sons Tim and Paul, 
from England to Bennington where they stayed, 
except for brief intervals, until 1965. The re- 
lationship between Noland and Caro has re- 
mained, to this day, a vital and dynamic friend- 
ship, on both a personal and intellectual level. 



Although Noland continued to use the chev- 
ron into 1966, he had become dissatisfied with 
restricting himself entirely to centering the 
motif in a square by 1964. This year he began 
experimenting with several alternatives, the 
most dramatic of which was the eccentric or 
asymmetrical chevron as in Bend Sinister, 
Sarah's Reach, ijth Stage and Trans Shift, all 
1964 (cat. nos. 38, 42, 45, 47). Noland attempts 
in these paintings to eliminate the inertia 
created by the areas of raw canvas which are 
left in the four corners of a square support by 
a symmetrical chevron. In these asymmetrical 
chevrons, a dramatic thrust toward the right or 
left-hand side of the painting replaces the cen- 
tral focus of movement of the symmetrical 
motif, and there is a shift to generally larger 



30 



proportions, more optical effects of brighter, 
more limited numbers of colors and rectangu- 
lar rather than square proportions. Noland 
compensated for eccentric form by altering the 
balance of his colors, the proportions of his 
bands and the shape of the support. He used 
fewer colors, widened his bands and some- 
times reduced their number. The resulting effect 
is of heightened drama. 

Two transitional works, Tropical Zone and 
Absorbing Radiance, both 1964 (figs.), present 
another variation on the chevron theme. In the 
former, two elongated chevrons meet in the 
center of a long horizontal field, while in the 
latter a diamond-shape is placed within a 
square. These formulations, however, left areas 
of bare canvas, just as the symmetrical chevrons 
in a square field did. Noland's only remaining 
alternative was to shape the canvas itself to 
conform to the interior motif. Noland accom- 
plished this, not by cutting the canvases, but by 
turning squares on end. Thus bare canvas was 
eliminated as a working element of the paint- 
ing. Examples of such diamonds are And Again, 
Halfway, both 1964, and Saturday Night, 1965 
(cat. nos. 36, 50, 53). The bands of the chev- 
rons in these diamonds parallel the edges of 
the supports. The motifs of these narrow bands 
of fully saturated color which are stacked to- 
gether in these paintings very much resemble 
those of the earlier chevrons in square formats. 
The use of the diamond represents a new de- 
parture for Noland, but it is not a new format, 
for both Bolotowsky and Mondrian, among 
others, had experimented with it. In paintings 
such as Arctic Diamond, 1947 (fig.), Bolotow- 
sky's image works against the diamond shape 
of the support: the composition, clearly based 
upon a rectangular grid, has simply been cut

off by the diagonal edges of the paintings. Mon- 
drian's resolution is far more complex. In num- 
erous examples as early as 1918-19, his 
rectilinear composition is organized and totally 
integrated within the diagonal boundaries of 
the canvas. His image is complete; there is no 
sense of the edge cutting off part of the com- 
position. In some early paintings, such as Com- 
position in Black and Gray, 1919 (fig.) and 
Composition in Diamond Shape, 1918-early 
1919, his grid structure parallels the contours 
of the diamond. In other works, such as Com- 
position with Blue, 19x6, Fox Trot A, 1930, or 
Composition iA, 1930 (fig.), he severely re- 
duces his strictly horizontal and vertical in- 
terior configuration to meet the challenge of 



the shape. In all three late works, the elements 
within the square interact with the diamond in 
a completely resolved viable manner. Even in 
such a complex and dynamic late painting as 
Victory Boogie Woogie, 1943-44, one senses 
that each interior element clearly acknowl- 
edges the exterior shape of the diamond. 

Once Noland started to explore the diamond- 
shaped support, he began to play with the pos- 
sibilities of the chevron motif. He produced 
several broadened diamonds, powerful works 
in which the interior chevron configuration 
conformed exactly to the shape of the support. 
Most notable among these are Grave Light, 
1965, and Dark Sweet Cherry, 1966 (cat. nos. 
51, 57). These fuller diamonds were followed 



by their opposite variant, the attenuated needle 
diamonds, which were based on a two by eight 
foot module. Noland produced the needle dia- 
monds in two different ways: he either cut 
them out of already painted rectangular hor- 
izontal fields or shaped them before he started 
to paint. The needle diamonds are something 
of an anomaly in Noland's oeuvre insofar as 
the narrowness of the format often constricts 
his flexibility with color. Nevertheless, in such 
paintings as Shift, 1966, Dry Shift and Deep 
Pillot, both 1967 (cat. nos. 59, 61, 62), the re- 
strictions of shape reinforce the impact of the 
succinct but resonant color. The exaggeratedly 
narrow format seems to have allowed Noland 
in the most successful of these works, as well as 



32 



in the related horizontal stripe paintings dis- 
cussed below, to use the optimum range of col- 
ors without diminishing the integrity of each 
individual color, to identify color with field. 

Despite his successful use of the shape, No- 
land did relatively few diamond paintings and 
even while employing this format he was ex- 
perimenting with other alternatives to the 
chevron. He was not particularly drawn to 
the diamond because he found its use incon- 
sistent with his central interest in color. To 
reiterate a major premise of Noland's art: the 
primary function of shape is to serve as the 
vehicle for color. The more neutral the shape 
the greater freedom it allows for color expres- 
sion. Thus certain exterior shapes, such as the 
diamond, or interior configurations, such as 
cat's-eyes, are too assertive for Noland and im- 
pinge upon and limit his use of color. It is 
because of his abiding concern with color and 
his concept of shape as carrier of color that 
Noland works in series: in a given series he can 
work out many different alignments of color 
in unvarying neutral motifs. 

In every series his concerns are the same: 

/;/ all the different kinds of pictures that I 
make I look for that possible range of size, 
scale, color. . . . When you play hack and 
forth between the arbitrariness and the 
strictness of the conditions of making pic- 
tures it's a very delicate threshold back and 
forth. . . . But you can plan the conditions 
for color ahead . . . you can get together . . . 
all the frames of reference that will get you 
into the condition of using color in relation 
to shape, to size, to focus, to depth, to tac- 
tility. 

Noland has noted that he likes ". . . that 



edge between water and land . . ." and that this 
landscape element is reflected in the horizontal 
stripe paintings he developed late in 1965-66, 
while he was experimenting with the needle 
diamonds. Approach, 1966 (cat. no. 56), is a 
transitional stripe painting of the period. It is 
composed of four horizontally aligned equally 
spaced bands. Its motif is related to the interior 
configurations of the diamonds and, although 
its support is rectangular, it is still based on 
the two by eight foot module of the diamonds. 
Many of the later resolved horizontal stripes 
are even more elongated. Some, like Kind, 
1968-69, and Each, 1969 (cat. nos. 77, 93) are 
extremely exaggerated in proportion and mea- 
sure six inches by eight feet. Noland discussed 
his feeling about scale and explained the ap- 
peal of these extreme proportions: 

/ had one picture that seemed to have a very 
good proportion — that six-inch by eight- 
foot size— that offered me the possibility of 
having a range of scales of color, or depth 
. . . going very deep in space to very shallow 
in space to very flat in space. And it just 
felt . . . good . . . I've done that quite a few 
times. Like the majority of the first circle 
paintings were six-foot square. . . . It ivas 
something that was physical to me I guess. 
So at different points I had located an actual 
size that I will repeat because I can extend 
many variances of scale or focus in that size. 
But on the other hand I'm always moving 
around in actual sizes. 

In this horizontal stripe series, as in the dia- 
monds, Noland attempted to deal with the 
problem of the unactivated expanses of bare 
canvas presented by the chevrons. The hori- 
zontal stripe gave him greater freedom than 



he ever had before. As Noland said, "These 
paintings . . . are the payoff ... No graphs; 
no systems; no modules. No shaped canvases. 
Above all, no thingness, no objectness. The 
thing is to get that color down on the thinnest 
conceivable surface, a surface sliced into the 
air as if by a razor. It's all color and surface, 
that's all." 

The circles were done freehand, and most of 
the chevrons were painted freehand or with 
rollers. It was not until Noland started to de- 
velop the horizontal stripes that he began to 
employ tape to achieve a straight edge. The 
use of tape in these paintings produced an 
effect of precision not present in the circles and 
chevrons with their looser freehand edges. But 
Noland worked out his initial concept free- 
hand even in the stripes, as he explains: 

When I begin to make a change from one 
kind of painting to another I usually go back 
to very loose type painting . . . fairly rough 
and fairly loose in order to put it together, 
as it were, by hand. And then as I can get on 
to a certain size or scale or spatial or tactile 
thing, then I can begin to set the process and 
then get at that sense of what that kind of 
painting, or what those kinds of paintings 
are going to be like. 

Once the format of the stripes had been de- 
termined, Noland began to apply his paint in 
a variety of ways — with rollers, with a brush, 
a squeegee or a sponge. He used many methods 
to achieve the thickness or thinness, mattness 
or sheen that he wanted a color to have. Colors 
varied in consistency, some buttery, some as 
"thin as water. All those ranges give you a 
difference of paint quality, give you a range of 
color." The nature of the painting, the place- 



33 



merit and proportions of a particular color in 
relation to the whole determined the specific 
method of application. 

By 1967 the horizontal stripe paintings had 
become exceptionally long and were comprised 
of bands of varying thicknesses and as many 
as thirty hues, often dramatically interspersed 
with areas of bare canvas. Via Blues, 1967 (cat. 
no. 71) and Transvaries, 1968 (cat. no. 89), 
are examples of such complex works. There is 
no doubt that use of tape in these canvases 
enhances the effect of tautness and creates an 
uninterrupted band of color which runs from 
one end of the support to the other. Although 
the interplay of colors in these works tends 
sometimes to be overly optical and thus dis- 
rupts the flatness of the image, they are entirely 
successful as all-over paintings. In fact their 
even surface articulation rivals Pollock's own 
all-over painting. 

Noland continued to use his all-over stripe 
motif after 1967 but made certain modifica- 
tions. In Via Lime, 1968-69 (cat. no. 90), for 
example, he retains the consistent surface ar- 
ticulation of the earlier stripe canvases but re- 
stricts his palette radically: the entire field is 
composed of many evenly spaced bands of pale 
gray, gray-blue, gray-green, gray-lavender and 
lavender on raw canvas, set off by a very 
narrow band of lime at the bottom of the sup- 
port. This single narrow lime band charges 
the entire twenty-foot long field. In several 
other paintings a field of a single color is inter- 
rupted by a much smaller number of widely 
spaced thin bands of electrifying hues. These 
narrow regularly disposed lines, like the hori- 
zontal bands of at least thirty hues in the early 
stripes, trigger an interaction between color 
and field and set up a tension that is the visual 



equivalent of the plucking of taut violin strings. 
In yet other canvases, like Via Tradewind and 
Vista, both 1968 (cat. nos. 80, 86), Noland 
limits the optical effects of his color by group- 
ing them in large clusters and restricting them 
to a single pale value range. This prevents the 
colors from jumping, as they had in earlier 
works, and also allows for a reading both 
across and up and down the surface of the 
painting with minimum disruption. This kind 
of pale, pastel painting reaches its most sub- 
lime level in Trans Echo, 1968 (cat. no. 88), in 
which color has been reduced as far as pos- 
sible—to white. These light-flooded works are 
related in their visual effects to the luminous 
canvases of the Impressionists. 

At one point in 1968 Noland appeared to be 
emptying the centers of his paintings: in can- 
vases of this year like Warm Above, Via Flow 
(cat. no. 79) and Dawn-Dusk (cat. no. 87), 
white is either the middle of the field or the 
main feature of the composition. Intense and 
glowing color is confined to narrow clusters of 
stripes at the top and bottom of the painting. 
The effect achieved is very different from that 
of paintings like Stellar Wise and April Tune, 
both 1969 (cat. nos. 91, 94), Prime Venture and 
Space Jog, both 1970 (cat. nos. 100, 103). 
In these later works Noland continues to clus- 
ter narrow stripes at the top and bottom edges 
of the canvas, but here he fills the center of 
the field with a single luscious color. Despite 
this important point of contrast, the narrow 
stripes serve the same vital function in both the 
earlier and later paintings of this type: they 
contain the central field of color. In 1969-70 
Noland shortened his canvases, and the result- 
ing compactness of the support serves to im- 
plicitly contain the field of color at each side, 



as the stripes explicitly limit it at top and 
bottom. Two related paintings, Double Zone 
and Mexican Camino, both 1970 (cat. nos. 97, 
99), retain the larger proportions of the 1967 
stripes. Color here is intense but subdued, and 
Noland counters the effect of its unimpeded 
lateral sweep by investing the field with texture. 
The modulation of the field in relation to color 
and proportion in these paintings represents 
Noland at his best. 

Noland's working method in the stripe paint- 
ings differed somewhat from his procedure in 
the diamonds which, as has been discussed, 
were often cut out of rectangular horizontal 
stripes. Noland, with the aid of the assistants 
he began to use in 1967, stapled a length of 
canvas to the floor. Then he painted the field, 
adding stripes at top and bottom. The canvases 
were then stretched and finally Noland cropped 
them, considerably reducing or even eliminat- 
ing some of the stripes. In many instances No- 
land cut several paintings from a single large 
horizontal field. But cropping was always the 
last step that determined not only size but 
the ultimate success of each work. This final 
cropping, the equivalent of the tuning of a 
musical instrument, has become an essential 
component of much of Noland's recent work. 

Around the time Noland was developing the 
horizontal stripe paintings, he and Caro de- 
cided to buy materials from the David Smith 
estate. Noland began to make sculpture, a 
practice which he has continued to the present. 
The first pieces, influenced by Smith and Caro, 
were of stainless steel and were subsequently 
reworked. In general, the development of No- 
land's sculpture parallels that of his paint- 
ing; in the instance of the shaped canvases, 
it precedes it. The first sculpture Noland was 



34 




Olitski, Lovely Scream, 1966. Private 
Collection 



sufficiently satisfied with to exhibit was Jenny, 
1970, composed of oak, brass, cor-ten and stain- 
less steel. The horizontal and vertical structure 
and the use of a variety of materials make this 
piece the sculptural equivalent of the plaid 
paintings Noland began in 1971. 

Noland had experimented with vertical for- 
mats while he was working on the horizontal 
stripe canvases. He did not, however, start to 
use vertical supports with regularity until he 
developed his plaid paintings. Noland's prece- 
dent for the plaid motif was Mondrian, who 
had used it to great effect in paintings like Netv 
York City I, 1941-42. Noland, however, cut 
several plaid paintings such as And Bines, Bines 
Intentions, Lift in Abeyance, Tipperary Blue, 
all 1971 (cat. nos. 106, 107, in, 113), from a 
single large field just as he had done with the 
horizontal stripes. These vertical plaid paint- 
ings are characterized by vertical and horizon- 
tal bands that crisscross and overlap— a 
formulation Noland had never before at- 
tempted. They are as a rule smaller and marked 
by looser paint application than the horizontal 
stripes. The plaids allowed Noland to experi- 
ment with a more painterly surface, for which 
he used varnish, gel and other emulsions, to 
bleed and overlap colors and in general to free 
himself from the restrictions imposed by the 
horizontal stripes. In 1972-73 Noland confined 
the intersecting bands to the edges of his 
canvases and filled the centers with vaporous 
colors that to a degree resemble the atmos- 
pheric hues of Olitski's spray paintings, for ex- 
ample, Lovely Scream, 1966 (fig.). Although 
Noland did not use a spray-gun, he was able 
to achieve much the same effect as Olitski did 
with his pale, luminous, misty washes of color. 
In several paintings he went so far as to create 



an Olitski-like edge. Although the edge is 
curved, it clearly relates to the boundary of the 
canvas; although it is linear, it asserts itself as 
painterly gesture— as in the early expressionist 
circles — rather than as drawing; although it re- 
sembles Olitski's formulation, it is unmistak- 
ably Noland's motif. 

Noland was relatively uncomfortable with 
the rectangular format, which he found too 
confining, and soon began to adjust his plaids 
to the shape of squares or rectangles, circles 
and diamonds. The crisscrossing lines, surface 
paint treatment and, what were for Noland, 
aberrant rectangular proportions of the earlier 
plaids had created indeterminate spatial effects. 
But in paintings like Under Color and Another 
Time, both 1973 (cat. nos. 116, 118), colors are 
relatively opaque, proportions are based on the 
square, and the symmetry of the diamond re- 
asserts itself as a classical frontal form of im- 
placable order and restraint. In Another Time, 
1973, a particularly successful painting, the 
crisscrossed lines no longer suggest a plaid but 
form a horizontal and vertical grid structure 
framed by the diamond-shaped support. 

Prompted in part by his experience of mak- 
ing sculpture, Noland began to move away 
from rectangular supports. After the plaids he 
experimented with several shapes and numer- 
ous surface effects. He tilted rectangles off axis 
and shaped his interior configurations to con- 
form to the resulting slight asymmetry. In these 
paintings motifs not unlike those in the uncan- 
nily predictive Snn Dried: Japanese Space of 
1963 (cat. no. 34) fan out to create subtle 
spatial effects. By 1975 Noland was slicing 
his canvases, much as he cut wedges out of 
huge sheets of cor-ten for his sculpture. No- 
land's first step in making the shaped paintings 



35 



is to tape off areas he calls "rays," which fan 
out in various directions on a large canvas 
rectangle. Then he chooses his colors, generally 
offbeat purples, yellows, blues, grays, browns, 
beiges. After he applies his paint he either 
sprays or buffs them with an electric buffer to 
achieve a variety of surface textures to balance 
the shape of the "rays." Then he cuts the rec- 
tangle into variously shaped paintings. In part 
because he works on the floor and paints from 
all sides of the canvas, Noland does not decide 
which is bottom and which top until the paint- 
ing is hung. He had often changed the orienta- 
tion of earlier paintings, such as circles or dia- 
monds, once they were installed. This final 
decision regarding orientation is a vital factor 
in the success or failure of Noland's work. 

By 1976 Noland began to shape extremely 
eccentric canvases. Now the canvases only 
remotely suggest the rectangles from which 
they were cut. In a painting like Burnt Beige, 
1975 (cat. no. 1 19), the only element that even 
vaguely recalls the upper edge of a rectangle is 
a narrow dark band at the top of the support. 
This band, incidentally, is reminiscent of the 
black one in Klee's Arab Song (fig.)— each 
stripe serves to anchor the painting that con- 
tains it to the wall. Noland's dark band is the 
one stable element in an arrangement that sug- 
gests movement. Each shape is the result of 
careful proportioning of color. The bands in 
the most recent works do not fan out as they 
did in the beginning; they are heavier, denser, 
chunkier and turn in upon themselves, much 
as the circle turns in upon itself. In fact, in the 
most successful of these works, the cumulative 
movement of the bands is circular. In such 
paintings as Burnt Beige, Ova Kay, both 1975, 
and Lapse, 1976 (cat. nos. 119-121), Noland 



deliberately suggests spatial ambiguity with 
irregular shapes and eccentric colors. These 
canvases may perhaps seem to be related to 
the chevrons which, although contained within 
squares or rectangles, were definitely shaped. 
However, the chevrons only inferred shape 
while these paintings are themselves shape. 
These works are less rigidly defined than one 
would expect, given their pronounced shapes 
and Noland's penchant for geometric forms. 
They are, in fact, far less specific than the 
shaped canvases of Stella or Kelly. The lack of 
regularity in the external shapes of Noland's 
canvases suggests that he is as uninterested in 
making objects of his paintings as he was in 
the late 1950's. He is far more concerned with 
the idea of shape as space in an illusionistic 
sense. These works are about space, as were 
the horizontal stripe paintings. The shaped 
canvases are in this sense the alternatives, the 
successors to the horizontal stripe paintings. 
The lateral extension of the central field of the 
horizontal stripes has become the shaped space 
of the new canvases. The luminosity of stacked 
stripes has been succeeded by the opalescent 
surface and texture of "rays" of color. Opacity, 
transparency, tactility, scale, size, inherent in 
the stripe paintings take on a new dimension 
in the shaped canvases. 

Noland ranks with Delacroix and the Im- 
pressionists among the great color painters 
of the modern era. Unquestionably heir to 
Matisse and Klee in the realm of color ex- 
pression, he is to his generation what they 
were to their own. Noland's search for the 
ideal Platonic form has crystallized into an art 
in which color and form are held in perfect 
equilibrium. The spare geometry of his form 
heightens the emotional impact of his color. 



The rational and the felt, distilled form and 
sensuous color intermesh to create a magic 
presence. His space is color. His color is space. 
Color is all.

Greenberg in his "Louis and Noland," Art Interna- 
tional, vol. 4, no. 5, pp. 2.6-29, declares Louis and
