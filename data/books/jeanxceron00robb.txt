JEAN XCERON is of Greek birth. His own form language, which 
reinforces the stylistic current of geometric abstraction that is rooted in 
Mondrian's neo-plasticism, came fully into its own between the two 
world wars, to remain, in modified form, a vital force in our own time. 
In the United States, Xceron's adopted home, the artist was a daring 
pioneer before he earned for himself the esteem and the admiration 
accorded to old masters. 

It is eminently fitting that his distinguished career as a painter should 
receive its most decisive endorsement through a one-man show at 
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. For it was this museum's first 
director, Miss Hilla von Rebay, who, far back in the 1930's, acquired 
Xceron's work, and James Johnson Sweeney who, long before succeed- 
ing the Guggenheim's directorship, aided the artist in his strive for 
recognition in this country. Partly as a result of such endorsements, 
Jean Xceron literally found a home in The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Foundation, where he has been employed and has fulfilled his duties 
with attentive loyalty ever since 1939. 

The current exhibit surveys selectively Jean Xceron's life-work. The 
artist himself has spent considerable time and effort in making sure 
that both the exhibition and the catalogue reflect his career faithfully. 
With his assistance, Daniel Robbins, until recently Assistant Curator of 
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, carried out and completed the 
task. As director of the Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of 
Design, Mr. Robbins will have the satisfaction of sharing the Xceron 
retrospective exhibition with the Guggenheim Museum.

XCERON 



BY DANIEL ROBBINS 



Jean Xceron learned about Classical antiquity at the Corcoran School of Art in Wash- 
ington, D.C. Between 1910 and 1917. fitting his academic training into a sporadic schedule of 
odd jobs within the local Greek community, he worked from plaster casts, patiently adapting 
studies of bones from the morning anatomy class to the contour drawings demanded each 
afternoon. In Washington. Xceron discovered that there was special cultural distinction in 
being a Greek, descended from the historical source of beauty as well as democracy. Like the 
rest of the Greek community, he was proud to realize that Classical tradition was the basis of 
the Beaux-Arts ideal ; and it must also have been satisfying to observe that his adopted coun- 
try designed the official buildings of its capital in imitation of ancient temples. But in 1910, 
it was somewhat difficult for Xceron to think of those ideals directly in connection with his 
immediate past. Those plaster casts, reflections of unseen originals, and those government 
buildings, colossal derivatives from unremembered prototypes, did not reflect the Greece of 
his boyhood. In the Greek Orthodox church, and in the homes of relatives and friends, he had 
seen and admired ikons, not Praxiteles ; and to relieve the cast copying, he spent hours in the 
Library of Congress studying plates of Ravenna mosaics, rendering them in watercolor, even 
venturing his own designs for mosaics and pictures of the saints. Furthermore, he knew that 
every town in the United States where Greeks settled needed such images. 

Xceron was fourteen when he arrived alone in New York, fresh from a small mountain 
village, Isari Likosouras, in the heart of the Peloponnesos. His father, Petros Xerocostas, was 
a blacksmith, and at home there had been no memories of a Classical past. Instead, there had 
been stories about the heroes of the Greek revolution, whose portraits Xceron had painted on 
the walls of his father's house. There were also ikons in the Byzantine tradition, for the saints 



12 



like the revolutionary heroes of less than a hundred years before, formed a real part of his 
family's life. To be an artist in such a tiny village was improbable, but the precocious decora- 
tions he made— the sculpture fashioned from bits of iron, copper wire and other scraps from 
the blacksmith's shop, the engravings on stone— these were admired as embellishments and 
signs of able craftsmanship. 

Xceron had relatives in America; in Washington, in Indianapolis, in Pittsburgh, 
brothers and cousins of his father had launched hat cleaning, shoeshine, ice cream and candy 
shops. These industrious immigrants, who formed closely-knit groups in each community, 
welcomed the fourteen-year-old Xceron as a countryman and an additional hand. From 1904 
to 1910 he lived with relatives in the Greek communities of these three cities, finally settling 
in Washington only when he was twenty and determined to be an artist. His skill was useful 
to the community, which turned to him for ikons. In 1918, to celebrate Greek Independence 
Day and Greek-American solidarity, he was asked to paint an enormous temporary mural for 
the pediment of the Treasury Building: scenes of Greek gods and heroes, balanced against 
modern patriots and soldiers. Xceron's Corcoran training was helpful to him, and the pageant, 
with Xceron's decorations, was such a success that the Greek flag and Xceron's decorations 
adorned the Treasury Building all day long. 

While at the Corcoran, Xceron not only encountered his presumed Greek heritage, but, 
more subversively, acquainted himself with the new traditions of modern art. Among his 
fellow students (who also included Abraham Rattner) were George Lohr and Charles Logasa. 
largely responsible in 1916 for creating Washington's "Armory Show" by borrowing a large 
group of paintings from Alfred Stieglitz in New York. Although this tardy version of the ex- 
hibition that had shocked New York, Chicago and Boston created little furor in Washington, 
it made a profound impression on Xceron, who realized that his own preference for the flat, 
rich patterns of mosaic, with their expressive distortion, was a great deal closer to the pro- 
gressive ideal than to his careful renderings from casts and models, even if they were Greek 
and certified by his art teachers. As a consequence, during his last year at the Corcoran he 
began to be regarded as a revolutionary. His increasingly free interpretations of the model 
(he painted a blue self-portrait with cubist faceting a la Picasso) and his earliest non- 
student works, Crucifixion No. 6, 1917, and especially Adam and Eve No. 9, 1919, show a graft- 
ing of cubism to Byzantine tradition. In his limited palette range, his geometric distortion of 
figures and his shallow space, Xceron's debt to early twentieth-century French painting was 
already evident, but in the scale of his work and in its naive charm, he preserved the feeling of 
a provincial ikon painter. The most advanced formal and iconographic device in the little 
Adam and Eve is the tree that vertically divides the work, serving simultaneously as snake and

tree trunk, with the apple functioning as the snake's head. For a short time Xceron flirted 
with the idea of making his living as a religious painter, he even planned a series of murals 
for the Greek Orthodox church in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He soon realized, however, that 
the cozy and insulated Greek community was not where art was advancing, so turning his 
eyes toward Paris, he moved to New York. 

It was in New York that, for the first time, he encountered another world and discovered 
to his surprise that the solidarity then existing among artists was not unlike that which had 
sheltered him since his arrival in America. He became friendly with Torres-Garcia, who 
painted his portrait in 1920 and met, among others, Weber, Walkowitz and Stella. He fre- 
quented the Metropolitan, the Public Library and the Whitney studio, and with his new 
friends exhibited in the New York Independents in 1921 and 1922 at the Waldorf. He began 
to travel independently, going up the New England coast as far as Ogunquit, Maine. The 
effect of these years is summarized in the more sophisticated, although less personal, work he 
was producing by 1923. Realizing that Cezanne was the principal source for those develop- 
ments in contemporary painting that most interested him, Xceron had consciously studied that 
master, abandoning both the primitive charm of his earlier work and its realistic detail in 
favor of a concentration on formal organization. Yet in Landscape No. 36, 1923, there is an 
anticipation of what would become one of the most important characteristics of Xceron's 
mature style: a diffused light radiating from the roof of the house, thus giving the little paint- 
ing a quality of buoyancy. This interest in light was then secondary, probably unconscious, 
for Xceron had set out to compose harmoniously, without regard to the direction of light or the 
length of shadow, certainly without regard to the time of day or the quality of subject matter. 

By the time he had saved enough money to go to Paris in 1927, Xceron had established 
an accomplished post-Cezannesque style. He had also established some valuable friendships, 
among which was that of an ex-Athenian family, the Dorros', who controlled a flourishing 
bridal veil manufactory with offices in both New York and Paris. Much later he was to marry 
Mary Dorros, but in the twenties it was her elder brother, Theodoros, a writer and intellectual, 
who exerted a profound influence on Xceron's intellectual development. Having commissioned 
a portrait of Tolstoy from Xceron, he then went on to interest the artist in a wide literature. 
Because of his encouragement, and with the help of introductions from Abraham Rattner, 
Xceron, who had been painting independently for more than ten years, found the confidence 
to write a series of articles for the Boston Evening Transcript and the Paris edition of the 
Chicago Tribune. He thus was accepted immediately into the Paris art world, not yet as a 
painter— of which there were hundreds from all parts of the world, but as an American critic 
highly sympathetic to modern art— of whom there were very few. He wrote articles on

Mondrian, Van Doesburg, Leger, Arp and Larionov; he visited studios, discussed painting and. 
unknown to many of his friends, he returned to his own studio and painted. 

Only the wise and sympathetic Torres-Garcia and the Dorros' knew that Xceron was a 
painter, but gradually certain Greek members of the Paris art world, the writers Christian 
Zervos and Teriade, the sculptor Tombros, not only discovered that Xceron painted, but that 
in his modest, quiet fashion he painted very well. His first one man exhibition thus opened at 
the Galerie de France in 1931 under the sponsorship of the influential Cahiers d'Art. Xceron 
was dazzled by the procession of notables who trooped through the gallery: Mondrian. Arp, 
Leger, Van Doesburg, Masson, Helion— almost every Paris painter of consequence, all painters 
about whom Xceron had written and all men whose work he had profoundly admired for 
years— came to see his paintings and went away impressed. 

What they saw was a group of post-cubist canvases tempered by a very personal 
lyricism. Had they known the Xceron who struggled between 1919 and 1929 to master the 
logical construction of Cezanne, they would have remarked the greater boldness with which 
he applied paint, and noted how curvilinear forms had replaced rectangular ones. It was 
evident, as in Violin No. 7 that his still life subjects were wholly and deliberately suggestive of 
human figures. This characteristic of imparting markedly human associations to what might 
at first seem to be purely investigative exercises in the organization of form became increas- 
ingly evident as Xceron's work developed. It appears in Portrait of the Artist No. 67, 1932, 
where the thrust and slight forward tilt of the head create a sense of great alertness, even 
though there is no expression on the face. It is also apparent that the head is an analogy to the 
top of a stringed instrument. 

Xceron's most significant painting of the early 1930's is Violin No. 6E. As James 
Mellow noted, this is a transitional work, proceeding from curvilinear forms on the left, where 
Picasso's influence is most apparent in the figure strumming a musical instrument, to purely 
horizontal and vertical divisions on the right, where one sees reminiscences of both early 
Mondrian and Torres-Garcia. 1 The painting, however, also contains an intervening stage that 
is an important key to Xceron's future work. This link is not so specifically localized as an 
area of the painting, existing rather as the necessary completion of an idea. The middle third 
of the picture is a close dissection of instrument forms themselves, the "S" curved sound 
openings, the strings and round holes. Thus, the final, right third of the work, where light 
modelled areas exist alone, represents pure sound, and the whole painting quite literally 
develops from reality to pure abstract effect, as evident in the iconography as in the regulari- 
zation of the forms from left to right: player, instrument, sound. 

All of Xceron's paintings from 1933 to 1936 strive to rid themselves of the last traces 
of figuration, yet equally, they are all about music, people and art. His forms meet with 
dignity, they never collide, never passionately embrace, never become uncontrolled. Through- 
out this period, he favored a vertical format, and gradually reduced textural emphasis, that 
density of pigment which had been so considerable during the previous six years. Finally, in 
1935-36 he worked almost exclusively in watercolor and gouache, for Xceron required this 
discipline to concentrate on his growing interest in light. This light came from no outside 
source, but instead radiated from the colors, clinging to the edges of a form and imparting a 
certain ethereal quality. 

Returning to oil in 1937, Xceron utilized the discipline he had gained from experience 
with gouache to produce beautiful, cool and transparent harmonies. He had developed a 
modelling or chiaroscuro that refused to turn or round the form. Unlike Leger, who also con- 
sistently modelled simple shapes to impart weight, density, or a sense of volume, Xceron's 
modelling achieved instead a palpable atmosphere around clear and intense forms, concen- 
trating greatest luminosity toward the center of the canvas as in Composition No. 242. His

shading was always from top to bottom, or bottom to top, never from left to right. In addition, 
although he used bright colors, he never assaulted the eye. Thus, in Painting No. 239, using a 
white ground with intense colors, he modulates violet like the pressured strokes of a pen, hard 
and then soft ; he plays a vivid yellow against white so that it almost flashes ; but, very carefully, 
he relieves the optical pressure with a narrow dark line against the form, and a nearby 
soothing green. 

As Xceron's works grew in confidence and delicacy, attaining by 1937-38 a rare tech- 
nical perfection, they gradually lost some of their once-characteristic innocent gravity to 
become almost playful. Toward 1940-41 (Composition No. 251), forms became smaller and in- 
dividual arrangements more intricate ; the geometric perfection of a curve or an ellipse freely 
modified, preparing for his first non-right-angled orientations. These changes are evident in 
the small, lyrical Fragments No. 252, 1941, where variations in background intensity 
have become more pronounced, the color gathering strength as it adheres— almost as if 
magnetically attracted— to the playful forms which for the first time meet in a series of oblique 
angles. Instead of a central, radiating luminosity, a quiet and subtle movement from dark 
edges to a light core, these edges fade into a nimbus of softly radiating light. In Composition 
No. 269, the shadows cluster around the forms, now more monumental and rugged. At the very 
core, an apparently solid, unmodelled shape slips quietly into the background, dematerializing 
into a magnificent violet glow. Xceron had reversed the customary function of light, for instead 
of using light to reveal form, he arranged to have it swallow shapes, dissolving the crispest 
forms in the process. He created a mysterious dawn, in which light absorbs rather than illumi- 
nates, his pure geometry. 

During the early 1940's, Xceron mastered absolutely quiet, infinitely subtle transitions 
in form, using color areas modelled from bright to dark, but without ever tilting a plane or 
causing an indiscreet jump either forward or backward. His surfaces were perfect and deli- 
cate, like a membrane everywhere equal. In 1944, however, the brush stroke, which had been 
banished since the gouaches of 1936. suddenly reappeared in White Form No. 271. In the 
Whitney painting (Composition No. 273) and the Miller painting (Composition No. 275), he 
began to work out the implications of this bolder touch which eventually would distribute 
radiating light areas against radiating dark areas to yield a much deeper space. In the Miller 
painting, the dark, dynamic cross-hatching seems to emphasize the attraction of dark for light 
and light for dark and these two forces are more nearly equal than they had been in the 
earlier, more tranquil paintings. 

At the same time, Xceron's color grew ever more bright and varied and his forms be- 
came more intricate, because they were consistently open. From 1945 through 1948, they were 
enhanced by a striking use of black line, a line broken and roughed by impinging color, as 
if white light could be sucked out of the multicolored void by these sensitive antennae (as in 
Multiform No. 303, 1947, or Rhythm No. 301). This was the period of Xceron's widely pub- 
licized painting Radar. 2 

Over the years, Xceron's art found increasing recognition. By the mid-1930's he was— 
to his surprise— a painter of reputation, one of the inner circle associated with Circle et Carre, 
Abstraction-Creation, and the Surindependants. When he came back to America for his first 
New York show at the Garland Gallery in 1935, he became friendly with two of the most 
perceptive Americans then interested in abstract art: James Johnson Sweeney and David 
Smith. Smith asked his advice and received counsel to become a sculptor. (Very good advice, 
it turned out.) Sweeney was instrumental in obtaining his second United States exhibition, at 
the Nierendorf Gallery, and for this Xceron again returned to America late in 1937. He never 
went back to Europe. At the Nierendorf. Hilla von Rebay saw his work and acquired examples 
for the Guggenheim Foundation, thus inaugurating a long association.

The American Abstract Artists, then barely organized, welcomed him with open arms 
for, in those days before the arrival of the great wave of exiled Europeans, he was one of the 
very few abstract artists who had acquired an international reputation. He had already sur- 
mounted some of the barriers that this handful of American abstract painters faced: public 
indifference and official hostility; his was a modest success that could help counter the deeply 
rooted provincialism of the American art world. Commercially, Xceron fared only a little 
better than his new colleagues, but he did symbolize the achievement of Parisian abstraction, 
and, for years (well through the 1940's, when American exhibitions were almost entirely 
dominated by regional and social realist art) Xceron was one of the very few abstract artists 
admitted into the large national competitions, standing out like a rare curiosity in almost every 
Pittsburgh survey, and somehow convincing even the most conservative juries of his honesty 
and skill as a painter. While working on the Federal Arts Project, he continued to execute 
resolutely non-objective murals, a style almost totally alien to the typically social realist 
W.P.A. art, even in the chapel at Riker's Island Penitentiary. One wonders what the inmates 
thought ! 

No fanfare ever surrounded Xceron or his work. Temperamentally incapable of sensa- 
tional behavior or active group participation, he could only continue to paint, even when the 
sudden explosion of a new kind of American abstract art began to command universal atten- 
tion in the late 1940's and early 1950's. In Paris, he had been briefly part of an international 
abstract movement; in the New York of the 1950's. he was already respectfully identified with 
the past, and gravitated back to the Greek community, where he felt most at home. This 
American-Greek community has yielded other important artists: Vagis, Nikolaides, Kaldis, 
Constant, Stamos, Baziotes, and more recently Voulkos and Lekakis— all Greeks, all of differ- 
ent times and temperaments. Xceron, however, was among the first, and Xceron, for fifty years 
has been among the most constant and diligent in his single-minded, unswerving pursuit of a 
quiet ideal. Other Greek-American artists moved more freely in the world of American art at 
large, became more American, identified with a prevailing style— much as Xceron (considered 
an International) had done during his ten years in Paris. Thus, the New York abstract move- 
ment swept past him to general acclaim, and Xceron, who had been one of the few exhibitors 
of geometric abstract painting in the 1930's and 1940's, still remained virtually alone during 
the 1950's: one of the few "classic" abstract painters. Today, in the mid-1960's, with yet 
another fresh wave of American painting dominating the catalogues of large group shows, 
Xceron's independence and individuality has become even more compelling, for he continues 
to develop and expand his art, even though its principles had been established in 1936-37. 
Now, there is no background of a current period style to submerge his great ease and quiet 
perfection, his quality as an independent artistic personality. 

To the attentive observer, Image No. 330, 1949, will seem as much an anomaly as the first 
brushed paintings of 1944-45. In many respects it represents a return to themes from the early 
1930's, although it is more subtle and complex in its allusions to figures and musical instru- 
ments and more resolutely cubist in its spatial organization, as if Xceron consciously grasped 
for his tradition to help sustain himself in the flood of Abstract Expressionism. It is also the 
first painting in thirteen years not chiefly concerned with light, and as such is a preparation 
for Xceron's next crystallized interest, the figure. He must have felt that his paintings had 
become too diaphanous, too soft, too light-enveloped, and therefore made an effort to tighten 
his forms, to create a more aggressive image with crisper internal movement. Painting No. 
239 and Sound No. 291 share qualities of hardness and softness; Beyond White distills crisp- 
ness of movement, but sheds rough black line. Finally, by 1954 with Ikon No. 386 and large 
delicate watercolors like Figure No. 389 A, 1955. a clear-cut single image emerges, a strong 
white megalith on a deep blue ground. 

Painting 9, No. 424, 1958. was the first Xceron since 1932-33 in the horizontal 
format. Although it employed the sharper forms that culminated with Ikon, the nature of 
the shapes underwent still further metamorphosis. There are no longer rectangles, circles, 
ovals, but more organic, suggestive images. The organization now recalls a landscape, with a 



17 



deliberate, slow movement from left to right, a glow of twilight against which are set rock-like 
shapes. On the right, a large white area hangs over a blue, reminiscent of a gleaming temple 
overlooking a precipice. This balance contributes a certain minimal anxiety, the level that 
Xceron tolerates; we know the white will not really topple, because it is so firmly balanced 
against the glowing light passage across the bottom of the painting. 

Through the next years and up to the present, movement in Xceron's paintings con- 
tinued to become more active, the colors growing stronger and, above all, the pulsation of 
light more prominent. References to figures and fragments of landscape become constant and 
more complete. Painting No. 426, 1959, and Painting No. 430, 1960, are, for Xceron, almost 
violent paintings. In the latter, angles clash in from all four corners and the figure forms- 
head, neck, breasts— are splayed out again in a landscape space. Composition 8, No. 432, 1960, 
is one of the boldest and most daring arrangements Xceron ever produced, with areas of 
intense swirling whites punctuated by incisive black arabesques that almost swamp the figure 
forms in the lower right. The figures, however, were determined (almost as if they had a will 
of their own) to emerge. Finally, in 1961 Xceron painted a white canvas black, and drew a 
frieze of almost barbaric, primitive forms across it, these illuminated by yellow-green light, 
with the light cohering as before to the edges of the forms. Although reminiscent of Classical 
black ground vase painting, this 1961 picture also sustains a blood red at the bottom, and a 
streak of deep blue behind. It has the quality of a ritual dance. In Source No. 445, 1962, the 
same method allows forms of violet and lurid yellow to grapple together like two archaic 
monsters in a field of bones and shattered trees. These shapes avoid collision. From an artist 
now over seventy, these works are the darkest and most romantic of his lifetime ; they include 
the El Greco-like Painting 7, No. 438, 1961. whose twisting forms lean in from dense space 
but, as always, never become uncontrolled. 

As brooding and near-violent as the large oils became through 1962, Xceron's drawings 
and watercolors pursued a more placid course. In theme, the barbaric and active figures that 
appear in the paintings present a sunnier, if no less primitive, mood. Pageant No. 558A, a 
drawing in the Walter collection, is exquisitely organized and possesses all the spirit of a 
group of centaurs at play. Finally, in the oils from 1963 to the present, all the figures clearly 
emerge— graceful, active, almost with facial expressions, always alert— playing against a 
sensuous clear blue which clings materially to the purity of their forms. These works, 
Caryatides 27, No. 452 and Figures 24, No. 449, 1963, were painted out-of-doors on clear and 
sunny afternoons. Xceron, 75 years old, seems to have returned to the Arcadia he had not 
seen since 1904, but his Greece was still not the Greece of plaster casts. 

In these years of old age, a whole painting career intervening and a wide culture at- 
tained, specific memories that had meant little or nothing when he first came to the United 
States begin to return: mountain-locked Isari Likosouras, his native village, was always 
flooded with light and to the south, the gulf of Messinia sparkled thirty or more miles away; 
the site of Lykosuras with its ruined city on an acropolis; the sanctuary of Despoina, its 
ruined Doric temple. These distant, but now meaningful images influence the imagination of 
Xceron, the still classic abstractionist, but also the Greek who wandered there, unthinking, as 
a youth. He can draw the temple now; sixty years ago it was merely a familiar heap of stone 
on the outskirts of his village. 

Xceron's art has always been so gentle, its drama internal and apparent only to those 
who follow it attentively. Instinctive, almost humble, it attains a rare poetry that too few have 
taken the trouble to contemplate. David Smith, who was as American as Xceron is Greek, and 
knew of the world as Xceron does not, once wrote to his painter friend "...You have the pic- 
tures and that is not new— you have always made them, and maybe they are too good, too subtle, 
too sensitive; but someday the world will catch up with you. Most artists are with you and 
that is the greatest level of appreciation . . ." 3
