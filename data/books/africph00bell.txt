Preface Thomas K 



omas rvrens 



This exhibition represents a substantial turning point in the museum's history. For the first time, African and not 
European constructs inform the ideas surrounding the works on view. Founded on the tenets of European modernism 
and its tendency toward abstract forms, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, from its very beginnings, has served 
as both a catalyst and champion or avant-garde theories and approaches to art. In/sight: African Photographers, 1 Q40 
to the Present is also rare in that it recuses major critical attention on issues or representation, a subject that either 
remained dormant or was subsumed by abstract idioms in past exhibitions. Painting and sculpture from Eastern 
and Western Europe, as well as North America, have been the mainstay of the museum for more than half a century. 
Only in the last few years have we had the means and opportunity to expand from that nucleus, leading us to address 
the globe at large and to include other mediums in our programming and collecting efforts. 

Photography is now chief among the museums pursuits. By broadening its engagement with twentieth-century 
art to encompass photography and multimedia, the institution has embarked on a dynamic journey, one that moves 
significantly beyond modernism's reflective inquiries to contend with art forms and discourses that challenge 
conventional ideologies while constantly advancing new methods of inquiry and debate. In bringing together thirty 
African-born photographers, this exhibition not only honors the achievements of these artists but highlights a 
medium whose fundamental relationship to the arts in Africa is largely unfamiliar to Western audiences. 

As always, our sponsors have proved to be the most pivotal of advocates. In order to embark on this project, the 
museum needed crucial funds for research and printed materials. Above all, I would like to thank Alberta Arthurs, 
Director of Arts and Humanities, and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto, Associate Director of Arts and Humanities, at The 
Rockefeller Foundation for their unwavering support of the Guggenheim Museum's endeavor to organize a 
presentation of African art. My appreciation is offered to The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, most 
especially to Pamela Clapp, Program Director, for her assistance and support. I am equally indebted to Jiirgen 
Weber, Chairman of Lufthansa German Airlines, for the company's continuing commitment to the museum and 
its projects. 

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the exhibitions four curators, who, in the spirit of collaboration 
and discovery that has defined this undertaking from its outset, have devoted a substantial amount of their time 
and creativity to selecting and writing about the photographs. The difficult task of locating so many photographers 
scattered throughout the world and bringing to light essential information about their work was accomplished only 
through their expertise and dedication. Finally, it is the artists and lenders who have truly made the showing of 
these works at the Guggenheim Museum possible. To them I owe my deepest appreciation.

From the beginning ol our research, it became abundantly clear that in order to present the works 01 photographers 

from Africa who now reside or lived in diverse countries on and outside that continent, we would need to rely on 
the guidance or numerous individuals and organizations. What we could not anticipate was the enormous outpouring 
of support for the project at every turn and, above all, the extraordinary amount 01 time and extort given unselfishly 
by everyone involved in its realization. We are deeply indebted to the staid at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 
especially Thomas Krens, Director, ror providing us with the necessary resources to lullill our ideas and the I reedom

Introduction Clare Bell 



In Western art history, trie use or place to connote geographical ho lindanes is a~ common a concept as it is dubious. 
There is no shortage or exhibitions devoted to surveying the cultural production &lt;&gt;1 particular countries, regions, 
and locales. Yardsticks for gauging collective ideologies, their function i^ often that of &lt;in agent oi consensus, 
inscribing, reading, and seeking to make visible a homogeneous thread within the culture under examination. Like 
a tourist, art history often encounters differences only to sum them up with the most convenient terms at its disposal. 
Multiplicity poses a difficult hurdle because it carries with it a sense of ambivalence and instability that disrupts 
the bedrock of fixed preconceptions previously rendered immutable by the rigors or geography. 

A pervasive differentiation between the subject (which has power) and the object (which does not) underlies all 
Western art; its very language is structured by active and passive modes of looking. Geographical considerations 
and their relationship to identity and culture have also been subsumed into an insulated dynamic thai privileges 
one point of view over another. This is made apparent by the existence of a First World mentality, which, through 
its connotation of hierarchical status, promotes the idea of a I hird World. Ierritory thus becomes a distancing 
device that authorizes Western representations by marginalizing or impeding those it seeks to regulate. I he 
problem with embracing difference, as the late critic Craig Owens proposed, lies in its concomitant sense of unease. 
"Pluralism . . . , he states, "reduces us to being an other among others; it is not a recognition, but a reduction to 
difference to absolute indifference. . . . What is at stake, then, is not only the hegemony oi Western culture, but 
also (our sense of) our identity as a culture." Self-reflexive rather than revealing, the recognition of place in these 
terms functions as a way to affirm our resolutions about ourselves rather than to tell us about others. 

Of course, perceptions of difference are by no means limited to considerations of geography, since they seep into 
every fiber of identity, whether it be gender, race, class, sexuality, or religion. The relationship between art history 
and terrain, however, becomes increasingly problematic when the discourse oi Western art is focused upon non- 
Western cultures. Under these circumstances, cultural relativism habitually abounds, and inconsistencies and nctive 
narratives routinely stand for "truth." In the case of Africa, in particular, the sanctioned division of land has served 
to define and promote the oxymoronic myth of a unified subjectivity. 

1 he remapping and exploitation of the African continent by European powers, which began in earnest in the 
mid-nineteenth century, continues to serve as one of the most insidious indexes lor Western definitions of the In es 
of Africans. The Berlin Conference, of f884— 85, authorized the expansionist plans 01 Belgium, France, Germany, 
Great Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and several other nations. I he "scramble lor ,\l rica, set firmly into motion 
in the 1 880s and abating only in the wake of World War II, established widespread European rule in Axrica, along 
with a standard of reference that has continued to endure in the Western imagination. \. Y. Mudimbe explains: 
Colonialism ana colonization basically mean organization, arrangement. I he two words deme from the Lalm word colere, 
meaning to cultivate or to design. . . . It can be admitted that the colonists (those settling a region) as well as the colonialists 
(those exploiting a territory by dominating a local majority) hare all tended to organize and transform non-European areas 
into fundamentally European constructs.^ 



Within this paradigm, diversity was reserved for European civilization, while all African societies were treated 
as one. Mudimhe further ohserves, "During this period both imperialism and anthropology took shape, allowing the 
reirication or the 'primitive.' " 4 Inasmuch as anthropology's very existence is ultimately bound to a Eurocentric frame 
or reference, its history, motives, and procedures have tended toward gross overgeneralizations.^ In attempting to 
reconcile the social sciences with the natural sciences, anthropologists in the nineteenth century seized on archetypes 
to account for the differences they observed in African societies. The writer and poet Chinua Achebe attests: 
To the colonialist mind it was always of the utmost importance to be able to say: "I know my natives," a claim which implied 
two things at once: (a) that the native was really quite simple ana (b) that understanding him and controlling him went hand 
in hand — understanding being a pre-condition for control and control constituting adequate proof of understanding. 
In the nineteenth century, there arose a proliferation of ethnographic studies based in no small part on the prevailing 
discourses of power and economics that were used to advance the merits of European society, while denigrating the 
achievements and silencing the lifestyles of those in the non-Western world. Africa was booty in Europe's industrial 
pillaging tor resources and surpluses, and its own economic (under) development was contingent on the ruling parties' 
capitalist policies. 

Photography, as Jonathan Crary affirms, acted in the period as "a crucial component of a new cultural economy 
of value and exchange." Its relationship to money and entitlement assured "that a whole social world is represented 
and constituted exclusively as signs."' And thus the photograph became an essential tool to further scientific 
observation and to fulfill voyeuristic yearnings. Science publications, postcards, and photographic albums produced 
in the period constructed a veneer of Africa, tending to represent people and communities as either raw data or 
spectacles. Such representations had a twofold purpose, as both a model of ritual, dress, and habitat, and as aberrant 
disclosure or anathema. Individual identity was subsumed in favor of category or type, the body functioning as an 
exterior site investigable and regulatable by the observing Western eye. As Roland Barthes aptly observes, myth and 
photography often work in unison. He defines myth as "a system of communication ... a message . . . myth cannot 
possibly be an object, a concept, or an idea; it is a mode of signification, a form." A photograph is "a mirror, what 
we are asked to read is the familiar, the known . . . but clarified, exalted, superbly elevated into a type." 

This exhibition is an attempt to broaden the parameters of the notion of place, thereby revealing the operations 
that contribute to the Western myth of Africa. Its goal is to present photographs created and disseminated by African 
artists engaged with issues of subjectivity — such as identity, self-determination, and difference — during a period 
that witnessed the nadir of colonialism and the formation of many independent African nations. The images are 
linked by a sense of presence. They provide vivid testimony to the manifold existences and ideas of their creators 
as well as of their subjects. At the same time, they may jolt us into recognizing our complicity in the concealment 
of those very lives. 

Ol the thirty artists represented, only a tew have ever shown their work together or in the United States. In order 
to cover a large expanse of time, the 1 39 objects in the exhibition were chosen by series or groups of images within 



10 



a particular period or genre. Some comprise artists first mature bodies ol work; others are the most recent 

manifestations or their oeuvres. While the exhibition is locused on the work ol Alriean photographers, its subject 
is not relegated to Africa. Indeed, all the artists in the presentation were horn there. Some have spent their entire 
careers in the countries of their birth; others, whether by exile, relocation, or personal choice, moved away, bo locales 
either within the continent or abroad. If this fact of birth accounts lor any similarities, it is also the site at which 
they scatter. Just as it is wholly impossible to sum up the experiences or a single individual, it is absurd to try and 
lormulate the ideological constitution of a continent. Nor is it possible to compress fifty years of photographic 
creativity into a monolithic survey. Taking a cue from writer and philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah s words that 
"Africa is a 'multiple existence," ' we selected photographers who have left their mark in varied genres, approaches, 
intervals, spaces, and milieus. 

Because photography and its tactics of positioning and display have played such a critical role in propagating 
colonialist myths about Africa, it is the camera, not the continent, that links the endeavors of the photographers. 
Deceptively linked to the "real," photographs traditionally achieve the status of documents. For the artists assembled 
here, the photograph's lack of closure, its ability to invoke a presence without sealing off meaning, takes precedence 
over the absolute fixity that the ethnographer, among countless others, has assigned to it. 

1 he presentation begins in 1940, when European occupation was slipping into decline. In Dakar, Senegal, Salla 
Casset and Meissa Gaye were among a generation of photographers that established studios to meet the growing 
demands of a new class of urban clientele, who desired portraits to share with their families, friends, and associates. 
Working from his studio in Bamako, Mali, Seydou Keita often photographed his sitters outdoors and posed against 
patterned backdrops (initially his own bedspread ), because he preferred to work in natural light. His photographs, 
which typically took as much as one hour to shoot, were commissioned by state workers and employees of Railway 
boudan, the major line linking Bamako to the fashionable city of Dakar. Keita s work from the 1950s includes 
depictions of well-dressed men and women, many of whom sport wristwatches or handbags. Appearing in his 
photographs may be a radio, telephone, Vespa, or even a car, items that Keita was able to purchase after the French 
left Mali and that he frequently offered to his sitters as props. " The photographs by these three artists are compelling 
in the way that their sitters confront the camera's gaze and in the relationship of model to picture plane. The latter 
is most pronounced in the use of a diagonal plane that projects the subject beyond the artilice of the studio and 
into the viewers space. 

Shot outdoors against simple canvases, in small northern towns of Cote d'lvoire, the bust portrait.- ol v. ornehus 
lao Azaglo Augustt from 1964 were commissioned by locals for identification cards that enabled them to vote 
and move more freely about the country. While the meagerness of dress and the Irankness in pose ol Augustt s 
sitters are in marked contrast to the more style-conscious clientele who sought out the studios ol ^ asset, I 'aye, and 
Keita, the resulting photographs offer evidence of their mediums critical role throughout Africa as a social and 
political agent of self-determination.

Presence is no less felt in Mohammed Die's 1946 works, which suggest the movement or Algerian citizens within 
the public ana private spaces ana environs of his home in Tlemcen. A poet whose photographic activity ceased after 
that year, Dib cautions against substituting images for remembrances. Rendered at a distance or glimpsed in partial 
light, his subjects are difficult to fix in time and place, as if cloaked by memory. 

Within the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, the immediacy and reach of popular culture throughout South 
Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, East and Central Africa resonate in the photographs of a varied group of African-born 
photojournalists employed by Drum magazine. Based in South Africa, Drum became one of the most widely read 
periodicals throughout the continent at a time when that country was adopting increasingly oppressive apartheid 
policies and other areas were undergoing massive restructurings. Photography was a critical component of Drum, 
the highly anticipated cover girl of the month gracing its exterior, and images illustrating stories on everything 
from politics, religion, and crime to entertainment, society galas, and sports contained within its pages. Drum's 
darkroom, in fact, was the initiation ground for photographers such as Bob Gosani and Peter Magubane, whose 
acclaim continued well beyond their involvement with the magazine. It was a critical forum for burgeoning 
photographers who, though barred from directly contesting the South African government's practices of segregation, 
nonetheless set out to record their own experiences and those of their communities. Disguises and detainments 
were commonplace in their goal to faithfully depict current events. Drum's role in supporting these photographers' 
efforts and circulating their work provides an important link to interpreting how photography was consumed 
at large. 

David Goldblatt and Santu Mofokeng, who are also from South Africa but work independently, present us with 
images that convey everyday existence tempered and at times urged on by political imperatives and the shifting 
ground of social and economic changes occurring within the country's townships and outlying provinces. Goldblatt's 
works from the 1960s, some of which were published in his 1975 book Some Afrikaners Photographed, depict a 
cross section of the population of Dutch-descended whites, whom he grew up among but knew very little of until 
undertaking his project. Mofokeng's photographs taken during the late 1980s, on the other hand, chronicle the 
experiences of black men, women, and children during the waning of apartheid. 

A plethora of commerce and rush of humanity occupy Ricardo Rangel's photographs of Maputo, Mozambique. 
Taken over a ten-year period when men were scarce in the city, their having been called away to fight in the struggle 
for independence from Portugal, Rangel frames his female subjects in moments of conversation, unease, or isolation. 
He conjures the claustrophobic and erotic nature of modernity by calling our attention to those new spaces of 
femininity taking root. 

Privy to his subjects' social circles, Malick Sidibe of Bamako was commissioned by young people to photograph 
their parties and outings. His images from 1970 of teenagers posing with their record albums, dancing together, 
and playing on the beach provide a glimpse into the often awkward and touching aspects of adolescence: the 
( amaraderie between friends, the freshness of romance, and the optimism of youth. 



12 



The notion or presence also niters through the photographs of Cairo shopkeepers by Nabil Boutros of Egypt, and 
it defiantly lingers in the abandoned graffiti-littered chambers of a prison cell captured in dim light through the 
viewfinder of Guinean Mody Sory Diallo's camera. Unlike Boutros and Diallo, other artists working since the 
1970s abandon the singular presence found in earlier photography, focused as it was toward serving the needs ol 
a customer or neighbor, or documenting events. Replacing that presence has been an inquiring one; in more recent 
works, the studio, landscape, and body serve as tableaux, fictions that are exposed or rewritten through a given 
photographer's individual vision and ideas. 

The self-portraits of Samuel Fosso taken in his studio in the Central African Republic when he was just a teenager 
in the late 1970s are reminiscent of the portraiture of earlier photographers, yet his use of dress, pose, and 
performance draws attention to slippages of identity rather than, tor example, social status. Photographing himself 
in a wide variety of attire such as bell-bottoms and a cap, or stripped to his underwear and wearing a pair of rubber 
gloves, his eyes typically cast downward or obscured by sunglasses, Fosso presents the viewer with calculated personas 
behaving in an experimental space. His portraits are subject to different readings of the self and the ways it can be 
constructed around and within sexual politics and the social spaces of private and public arenas. The idea of a 
transitory self is evident in the spectral, phantomlike images that characterize photographs by artists such as Kamel 
Dridi, Touhami Ennadre, Jellel Gasteli, and Lamia Naji, and in interrogations of the body or the institutions that 
exploit it addressed in the light boxes of Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye or Zarina Bhimji. 

It was Barthes who said, "Pictures become a kind of writing as soon as they are meaningful." 1 For artists such as 
Gordon Bleach, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, and IkeUde, photography is a text, a scripted presence that both circumscribes 
and refutes the rhetorical forms of colonialist sensibilities, while nourishing fresh perspectives on subjectivity. The 
challenge for each of the artists in the presentation, as well as for those of us looking at their works, lies not in 
resurrecting an image of Africa as place, but rather in examining the matrix of experiences that invites questions 
about language, history, and environment.

Colonial Imaginary, Tropes of Disruption: History, Culture, and Representation in the 
Works of African Photographers OWui Enwezor and Octavio Zaya 



To mount an exploration of African photographers, living or dead, exiled or residing on the continent, is bo initiate 
an investigation of daunting magnitude. Equally, it means entering the terrain of transnational debates on questions 
of Africanity and issues of boundaries, race, culture, and politics, debates that are at once problematic and enriching. 
It also entails highlighting new insights on modern and postcoloniaJ African identities and experiences, which may 
in turn lead to the uncovering of forgotten photographic material. 

In pursuing this exploratory activity, it is practically impossible to examine African art and history of any period 
without talcing into account Western anthropology's complicity in constructing and framing a natural history of 
critical intransigencies and visual codes, as well as the specific means through which the West has apprehended, 
consumed, and interpreted the African continent as a site of both scientific inquiry and popular entertainment. In 
building the framework through which this encounter has been accessed and codified as unimpeachable knowledge, 
photography has often been allied with anthropology. Such codification is exemplified by the tens of millions of 
postcards produced in the nineteenth century to sate Europe's appetite for exotic, colonized peoples as specimens 
of curiosity inciting a lurid benevolence. This ethnographic sensibility, which inspired Western artistic, cultural, 
and scientific pursuits in the past, seems inexhaustible today, as it continuously feeds the commercial hungers of 
popular entertainment, particularly in movies and pulp fiction. No continent meets the demands of these 
entertainments better than Africa. Looking toward the more distant past, the movies Tarzan, King Solomon's Mines, 
and Birth of a Nation come to mind, and a cursory examination of blockbusters made in the last fifteen years yields 
such examples as Indiana Jones, Out of Africa, Congo, Ace Ventura, and The Gods Must Be Crazy. Such movies indicate 
that Africa remains a territory of the Western imagination, often crudely constructed as an aberrant human domain 
or as a comical screen upon which the visuals of such imagination can be projected. 

In movie footage and also in literature, Africa has been made completely invisible, obscured and masked, screened 
from our consciousness, and elided from the world's memory banks. For example, Africa is a void, a deep black 
hole that young Charles Marlow, in Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness (1902), hankered after to quell his 
passion for maps and the glories of exploration. Says Marlow: 

Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and 
lose myself m all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces four emphasis/ on the earth, and when 
I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (hut they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, "\\ hen I grow 
up I will go there." . . . But there was one yet — the biggest, the most blank, so to speak- — that I had a hankering after. . . . 
It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery — a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a 
place of darkness. 

Marlow was seized by the giddy urge to possess and own, to occupy and have the power of sanction and legislation, 
and to impose his will and mastery over territories, territories that could only exist as blank spaces. Today, Marlow - 
passion and hankering might be read as a deformity, but his desire was very much in tune with late-nineteenth- 
century reasoning, a time of explorers, missionaries, and mad scientists. Just as Marlow's attitude reflected the 



17 



reasoning of even the most enlightened people or the period, Heart of Darkness set the contemporary literary tone 
for the early twentieth century's perception or Africa: Africa as a tangle of bad dreams, hallucinations, disease, 
madness, and moral decrepitude, Africa as a place where the mind wilts in the humid frenzy of incomprehensibility 
and cruelty. Of course, Conrad (who himself actually embarked on Marlow's journey to the Congo) as a fiction 
writer took the liberty to conjure up images that would adequately frighten the European mind and thus reinforce 
the idea of Africa as a no-man's-land filled with evil, from which only the strongest could emerge unscathed. 

The specific ways through which spurious Western agents have constructed a dense catalogue of knowledge about 
Africa, in the process distorting its rich and long historical and cultural traditions, are telling. Such distortions, as 
Nicolas Monti notes in his remarkable book Africa Then: Photographs, 1840— 1Q18, "formed the romantic myth in 
which the European bourgeoisie tried for the last time to manifest two opposing values: freedom and power." 
Ultimately, what the European powers that conquered, colonized, and exploited Africa produced is a rendering of 
the continent as an amoral, primitive, and marginal site of dark, brooding forces, misery, and pestilence, a place 
that both cripples and fervidly arouses the imagination of the traveler, explorer, missionary, bounty hunter, and 
colonist. Indeed, it is a matter of quite some contradiction that Africa is also often promoted in the West as the 
cradle of civilization, an Eden where the last vestiges of a primeval paradise — with its lowland savannahs, misty 
peaks of mysterious mountain ranges, evergreen valleys, and thundering waterfalls — can be glimpsed from safari 
trails and game parks. There, in a pure state of nature, purged of any kind of native mediation, the spirit soars, the 
"heart of darkness collapses and gives way to untrammeled beauty, awe, and innocence. It is out of such invocations 
that many Europeans have embarked on trips to Africa. One famous example is the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, 
who, before abandoning poetry and setting out on his exploration of Africa, declared with fanfare and fantasy in 
1 873 that he was quitting Europe for odd climates that "will tan me." Above all, he craved freedom from a corrupt 
France, which was terrorized by the Catholic Church. He ran away "to swim, to trample the grass, to hunt, above 
all, to smoke; to drink liquors strong as boiling metal." He continued, "I shall come back, with limbs of iron, my 
skin dark, my eye furious." What strange desires these were, desires that only the most fictional places on earth 
could fulfill. Of course, the Africa of Rimbaud's imagination became, upon his arrival, a place whose peoples he 
regarded as "stupid and savage." Fifty years later, Andre Breton and his Surrealist cohorts, in their love for 
delinquency and juvenile rebellion, celebrated Rimbaud, in the first Manifesto of Surrealism (1924), as "a Surrealist 
in the practice of life and elsewhere." The irony of Rimbaud's racist impulse, and the fact that he ended up in Aden 
Oemen) and Harar (in what is now Ethiopia) as a gunrunner and slave smuggler, was obviously lost on them. 

As a result of the errant experiences and accounts of many such individuals from the West, Africa has remained 
a foil for Europe s civilizing tendencies and delusions of superiority, "a place of negations at once remote and vaguely 
laminar, in comparison with which Europe's own state of spiritual grace will be manifest." Let us eavesdrop on 
kudyard Kipling focusing his imagination upon two vast territories: India, the subcontinent where he was stationed, 
and Africa, the continent where he was born. He writes in "The White Man's Burden" (1899): 



18 



Take up the White Man's burden — 
Sena forth the best ye breed — 
Go hind your sons to exile 
To serve your captives' need; 
To wait in heavy harness 
On fluttered Jo/k and wild — 
Your new-caught, sullen peoples, 
Half devil and half child. 

In this last line, "Hair devil and nail child," Kipling, like his contemporary Conrad, provides us a peek into the 
binary code that not only gave impetus to, but also defined and justiiied, colonial subjugation. Beginning at the end 
or the eighteenth century, alter Napoleon's invasion or Egypt, a massive effort was made by European powers to 
open up the African hinterland for trade and also for the pursuit of Christian missionary activities. The contest 
between the French and British for the control of trade from the Red Sea led to the opening of the Suez Canal in 
1869. In his essay "The Power of bpeech, V. Y. Mudimbe notes that "the more carefully one studies the history of 
missions in Africa, the more difficult it becomes not to identify it with cultural propaganda, patriotic motivations, 
and commercial interests, since the missions' program is indeed more complex than the simple transmission of the 
Christian faith."' 1 As part of Europe's conquest of Africa, missionaries and explorers came, followed by 
photographers, anthropologists, and various other experts, under the guise of these firmly established scenarios and 
motivations. African self-images grounded in centuries of civilization would be condemned by the European 
scientific and intellectual communities as heathen, unclean, primitive, and savage. Georg Wilhelm Friedricn Hegel, 
in Philosophy of History (1840), writes that Alrica "is no historical part of the world; it has no movement or 
development to exhibit. Historical movements in it — that is in its northern part — belong to the Asiatic or European 
world. ' This prejudice was developed later by Count Arthur de Gobineau and others. Its refutation would become 
the lifelong quest of the Senegalese historian and anthropologist Cheihh Anta Diop. According to Diop's writings, 
the invention of the savage meant equally the invention of a master who must tame and guide him. Such notions 
would pave the way for Europe's final assault on and subdivision of the entire continent into colonies. 

On February 23, 1885, at the Berlin Conference, under the auspices of Otto von Bismarck, fourteen European 
nations redrew the map of Africa, dividing the continent between themselves and conrerring the right to explore, 
prospect, and draw subboundaries as they saw fit, as long as these activities did not interrere with the territorial 
claims of other member nations. This mad drive, for it can be called nothing else, set in motion what is known 
historically as the "scramble for Africa." After the rush was over, only three African countries, Ethiopia (Abyssinia), 
Liberia, and Morocco, maintained their standing as independent states. 

The brutal and total annexation and occupation of Africa lasted for less than a hundred years. But it lelt an 
indelible mark in its notion of African national identities, since such identities were more or less figments ol the 



19 



colonial imagination. Borders were drawn indiscriminately by trie European powers without any consideration of 
the location or specific cultures when the cartographers arrived. Beginning in the 1920s, attempts to reverse the 
course of this territorial violence were made, thereby challenging European hegemony and political and cultural 
authority. These protestations, which gained momentum from the 1930s, laid the foundation for a protracted 
battle for independence. The first independent states to come out of this struggle were Egypt, under Gamal Abdel 
Nasser in 1954, and Ghana, under Kwame Nfcrumah in 1957. These two figures helped usher in anewpostcolonial 
era, but, more importantly, they almost single-handedly denned the ideological positions of Pan-Arab unity and 
Pan-African unity. 

Although African nations won independence, Western stereotypes and misconceptions about Africans persisted. 
It is pertinent to illustrate the hind of image of the African that has survived for generations in the West, since 
photographic representation is essentially about the image and its construction as a visual analogue. Returning to 
Heart of Darkness, in a passage characterized by both racism and the most implacable earnestness, Conrad enacts 
a deliberately false description, as if to write a summation of the Western perception of the image of the African 
savage: 

Ana between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical 
boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and 
a feather hat, walking on his hind legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam 
gauge arid at the water gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity — and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool 
of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his 
hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving 
knowledge. 

It is the person and context of the above description that are the subjects of this exhibition. While we cannot 
redeem such distortions, the works in the exhibition provide a different account of that African landscape and 
history, difficult as they may be to (re)present in two dimensions. Over the course of its encroachment in Africa, 
no medium has been more instrumental in creating a great deal of the visual fictions of the African continent than 
photography. Yet, ironically, in attempting to defuse the power of these historicist fictions, we must rely upon 
photography and its vast array of signs, which also stand at the juncture of this refutation. 

Photography and the World as Image 

In its more than one hundred fifty years of existence, photography has left us a deep and startling archive of human 
identity, il^ memories, presences, and absences. In a sense, what it has deposited in our care, for our gaze to linger 
upon, are tne traces and imprints of vanished moments, while it leaves unaccounted the motivations behind the 
mail n-: ol individual photographs. As a supplement, referent, or index, the photograph invokes the perception of 
a presence on a flat surface. Yet the photograph in reality documents the absence of the subject represented. Drawing 



20 



on this apparent contradiction, Roland Barthes writes that "the Photograph is pure contingent y and can be nothing 
else."'' Moreover, photography's prodigious ability to inhale and disseminate so much inrormation multiplies this 
false sensation or the inscription or presence, thus frustrating efforts to categorize the medium's meaning as a stand- 
in for visual and/or experiential truth. 

As we gather together the stories or pictures created through photography, we must, however, insist on the necessary 
contingency of all historical accounts, particularly in the case or modern African history, as we scan its progression 
across the scarred pages of the legacy of European colonialism. An empirical doubt must arise when we are 
confronted with the "veracity or certain data — historical records and accounts, and images, especially 
photographs — built around Africa. In pausing on the issue of photography as an instrument furthering certain 
historicist fictions, charting and inscribing a visual palimpsest of the West's perceptions ahout otherness, we must 
question what is often seen as photographic truth and the notion of photographic images as stable, fixed information. 
Can decontextualized images be facts contained within an unembellished history? Can they represent an empirical 
record or experience or serve as ohjective stand-ins for history? 

For photographs to have any meaning beyond their functions as memento mori and as instruments of evidence 
and record, we must acknowledge another stabilizing factor: the gaze, that which Gordon Bleach has aptly termed 
"the negotiated space of viewing." ' When we tahe on Africa as the subject and African photographers as the 
interlocutors in this "negotiated space of viewing," the difficulty of interpreting what has been encoded as visual 
truth arises. Because there is now no prior existence of a language per se with which to discuss photographic activity 
in Africa (although photography in Africa is no different from that in any other region of the world), what is revealed 
in interpreting the gaze or the Held of vision is its implicit contest for the power of ownership. We must raise the 
question that has often encircled theoretical investigations into the nature of photography: who owns the image? 
Is it the property of the photographer or the viewer, whose prejudices and habits of viewing disturb the Held of 
recognition, thereby unsettling the still waters of the photographic image, its codes and (mis)representations, and 
its disintegration as a unitary embodiment of the subject represented, particularly when the clues left behind arc 
optical rather than experiential? Bleach poses this problem as a "disorientation: the powers and dis/pleasures of 
how it feels to (be) looh(ed at) are integral to an account of the subject of vision." 

In considering the work of the thirty photographers selected, who were all born in Africa but may have lived 
within or outside the continent, and who are diverse in nationality, ethnicity, race, and religion, we are attempting 
to explore the critical issues that underpin their practices, identities, and experiences as Africans. In one way or 
another, Africa as seen through this exhibition is not a monolithic supposition, nor is it merely an idea that can be 
bent to our wishes and desires. Consequently, all the participating photographers touch on the nudes ol these 
demands. They speak from positions that allow us to explore their various cultural and artistic imperatives, while 
opening up avenues to examine the dynamic relationship between past and present, history c\nd memory, time and 
space, origin and authenticity, desire and ambivalence, and ethnic and sexual identity. However, what is trim 



21 






enriching, thrilling, and even vexing is the diversity or approaches, disciplines, and strategies that the artists have 
brought to photographic practice. They invite us to call upon the processes and resources of cultural, social, and 
personal transformation as they are unraveled within African realities and within experiences of relocation and 
diaspora. 

Several photographers represented anticipated such issues that defined and at times unsettled aspects of 
the African experience. Their responses to our request to submit personal statements for this catalogue, as well 
as other writings by them, have been central to our formulations and interpretations. The artists' individual 
subjectivities and attitudes about representation are also mapped upon the meta-territory of the exhibition site. 
Santu Mofokeng of South Africa, for instance, writes that in the context of apartheid, "I had a rationale 
for documenting the lives of black people in the South Africa of yore, but, now that things have changed, it has 
become more difficult to legitimize my role as a documentary photographer in the traditional sense. As I get more 
intimate with my subjects, I find I cannot represent them in any meaningful way. I see my role becoming one of 
questioning rather than documenting. The projects I have undertaken recently are about the politics 
of representation." " Nigerian-born Rotimi Fani-Kayode, one of the most promising young African photographers 
until his untimely death in December 1989, wrote, As an African working in a western medium, I try to bring 
out the spiritual dimension in my pictures so that concepts of reality become ambiguous and are opened to 
reinterpretation." 3 Fani-Kayode wished to repossess "the exploitative mythologizing of Black virility" and 
"the vulgar objectification of Africa ... to reappropriate such images and to transform them ritualistically into 
images of our own creation. 

These critical positions are an important part of the emerging discourse about contemporary cultural production 
within an African context. However, though many issues have been raised in this regard, much work remains 
unearthed or unexhibited. There are structures that historically have staked claim, appropriated, restricted, and 
controlled the access, diffusion, circulation, and representation of African art, from London to Paris to Zurich, 
which have also affected African photography. So how do we address questions of representation, self-imaging, and 
artistic freedom when those initiatives are counteracted by stronger economic imperatives, and when the 
contingencies of social and epistemological control are made to bend to the influence of power and access? The 
answer at the moment is that there is little that can be done until the scholarly and historical import of these primary 
materials is made public. Hence, this exhibition is necessary. 

Signs of Disaffection: Photographic Truth, Technology, and Ethnography 

Once seen as both a novelty and a scientific breakthrough, photography has quietly been assimilated into the realm 
of tradition. It nii longer suffices to discuss photographic activity solely on the basis of its mimetic capabilities. 
Berore brie invention o\ photography, painting served this documentary function. And, just as photography 
3upplanted narrative painting, cinema and television in turn have attentuated photography's formerly exclusive 



22 



claim to the innnite reproduction and dissemination of the image, today, video, digitized images accessed via 
computer, and CD-ROMS occupy this terrain. 

Nevertheless, photography remains one or the most enduring and focused instruments ol documentation, 
regardless or its fragmentary constitution, falsehoods, and mise-en-scenes. Its allure and seductiveness still 
conscript our gaze, turn us into voyeurs, and utterly redefine our status as observers. Today, the aforementioned 
technologies have setup new kinds of visual fields that convert the retina to an active sensorium of bodily experiences, 
where codes of photographic meaning constantly seem to be turned into instruments of subversion. 1 hrough this 
enmeshment, a relationship is established in which the very status or the image can be not only altered and made 
contingent but also proliferated through myriad networks, modes of production, and multiple route.- ol delivery. 
However, it is important tor us not to become engulfed by the latter visual fictions no matter how seductive and 
apparently stable they may seem. 

With the advent of new imaging techniques, photography has crossed the boundaries set up by Walter Benjamin 
in his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1936), an illuminating reading of the 
potential effects of the productivist economy and the reproducibility of photographic images upon the ways that 
art is traditionally valued. It is not that formerly dominant modes of visualization have changed or that their 
meanings have been obviated; rather what it is that images recount and conduct within the field of vision has shifted 
perceptibly. Jonathan Crary elucidates this shift when he writes: "It these images can be said to refer to anything, 
it is to millions of bits of electronic mathematical data. Increasingly, visuality will be situated on a cybernetic and 
electromagnetic terrain where abstract visual and linguistic elements coincide and are consumed, circulated, and 
exchanged globally." " In this proliferation, it is the subject of the encounter in the electromagnetic terrain that 
poses the greatest challenge to the reading of the photographic index as a document of experience. Crary grasps 
this dilemma and invests it with a set of questions that pierces the skin of what has been termed the discursive space 
of photography: "What is the relation between the dematerialized digital imagery of the present and [that ol] the 
so-called age of mechanical reproduction? . . . How is the body . . . becoming a component of new machines, 
economies, apparatuses, whether social, libidinal, or technological? In what ways is subjectivity becoming a 
precarious condition of interface between rationalized systems of exchange and networks of information? 

The questions raised by Lrary bear particular relevance in how we image and consume the idea of Africa m that 
"interface between rationalized systems of exchange and networks of information." As technology changes, so do 
the possible ramifications for our relationship to material culture and visual information. If we suppose that visual 
information is now available as cartographic inscriptions both coupling and delinking digital codes, does it yield 
access to a new kind of vision and a new and renovated subject no longer bound up with the fetishism and voyeurism 
of traditional photography, particularly that type prevalent within the discipline of ethnography? 

From the mid-nineteenth century on, with the growth of colonialism and territorial expansion, a commodihcalion 
and categorization of those peoples perceived to be different was practiced by Westerners. As a documentary tool, 



23 



photography was important in providing lasting evidence or the fieldwork oi anthropologists, the discoveries or 
explorers, and the results or scientific studies. The intense imagination oi the West's ethnographic lens is revealed, 
for example, in the Orientalist fantasies of paintings by Eugene Delacroix and of French photographic scene et type 
postcards that turn the bodies of nude Algerian women into objects intended purely for the erotic pleasure of the 
colonial gaze. Following Maleh Alloula's seminal study of scene ettype postcards, The Colonial Harem (1986), Salah 
Hassan writes, in an astute interrogation of Orientalism, that "Delacroix's painting [Women of Algiers] and the 
postcards were part of the visual tradition built on preconceived notions essential to Western images and perceptions 
of Oriental women." 1 Even for the naive Western consumer, to comprehend the subject as framed by the 
ethnographic lens is to participate in the decapitation or cannibalization of the subject, as the grossly misrepresented 
African body is consummately fed to the passions of a false imagination, working in consort with the notion of 
scientific inquiry. 

In nineteenth-century studies, subjects could be put through all sorts of bizarre apparatuses in order to display 
and quantify their encoded gestalts. Physiognomy revealed the body as an avatar containing knowledge available 
only to science, which could be documented as evidentiary truth by the analytical mechanism of photography. 
Anthropometric photography was particularly useful in this exercise, because in providing measurements it 
purportedly gave "objective" interpretations and records of the body as a specimen or type. Brian Street writes that 
"the nineteenth-century focus on the physical and visual features of cultural variety gave to photography a particular 
role in 'the formation of a particular discourse of race which was located in the conceptualization of the body as 
the object of anthropological knowledge.'. . . Anthropological interpretation of the body was conceptualized through 
'physiognomy' — the belief that the facial and bodily features indicate specific mental and moral characteristics." 
Today, even within the "enlightened" corridors of postmodern discourse, the question of difference is still based less 
on the existence of a multiplicity of identities than it is on the equating of difference with race and otherness. 
Ethnography still replicates and enters into the service of power. According to Crary, "Problems of vision then, as 
now, were fundamentally questions about the body and the operation of social power," in the guise of benevolent 
scientific investigations. 

What then are the purposes of the purported meaning of photographs? What forms of knowledge do they expose? 
For whom and for what? How can we trust or be sure of what is being proffered as a form of representation when 
it is invested with a knowledge beyond mere incident? Elizabeth Edwards writes: 

Central to the nature of the photograph ana its interpretive dilemmas is its insistent dislocation of time and space. . . . Closely 
related to temporal dislocation in a photographic context is spatial dislocation. In the creation of an image, photographic 
technology frames the world. Camera angle, range of lens, type of film and the chosen moment of exposure further dictate and 
shape the moment. Exposure is an apposite term, for it carries not only technical meaning, hut describes that moment "exposed 
to historical scrutiny. The photograph contains and constrains within its own boundaries, excluding all else, a microcosmic 
analogue of the framing of space which is knowledge.

These fraught questions come into play in Barthes's critique or Richard Avedon's objectifying portrait ol William 
Casby ( 1 963). In the picture in question, a tightly cropped, straight-on view of the face of an aged Alii can American 
man, Avedon took pains to excise all obtrusive details that might have inflected a different context to the reading 
of Casby's portrait by zeroing in on the most delectable detail, the mash. Barthes follows Italo Calvino's use of the 
word "mash" to "designate what makes a face into the product of a society and ol its history."" The photograph is 
modified by an important linguistic signitier, the title that reads "William Casby, Born a Slave." Clearly, this is less 
a portrait than a sociological and anthropological study. The title points to the limitations of the photograph as a 
carrier of truth, for the portrait of Lasby needs the stabilizing factor of language employed not for clarification or 
as a source of knowledge but solely for the viewer's delectation. In Barthes's context, Casby's picture purports to 
tell us the essential truths of photography's "assuming a mask" in order to signify, when in reality it is feeding us 
information about the otherness of the subject. The photograph seeks to reveal Casby's difference Irom the rest of 
society. He is an endangered, dying breed, a monster who must be preserved, even if the process of preservation is 
essentially false. Indeed, the photographic meaning of Avedon's project might have been completely lost to the 
viewer without this signpost, the title that points to an irredeemable otherness. Avedon was thus able to create by 
means of his camera, linguistic modification, and position of power as an objective observer a sample or fragment 
of a "'type', the abstract essence of human variation . . . perceived to be an observable reality." The temptation is 
to consume this image as if it represented a form of knowledge more profound than its trashy voyeurism. We are 
tempted to use this inevitable detail to represent the whole, to allow the specific and incomplete to stand for 
generalities, and to allow one image to become "a symbol for wider truths, at the risk of stereotyping and 
misrepresentation. 

Here, then, is Barthes's interesting reading of Avedon's image. Seeing the mask as a "difficult region" of 
photography, he goes on to elaborate that "society . . . mistrusts pure meaning: It wants meaning, but at the same 
time it wants this meaning to be surrounded by a noise. . . . Hence the photograph whose meaning ... is too impressive 
is quickly deflected; we consume it aesthetically, not politically."" Are we to assume then that Avedon's title, which 
Barthes ignored in his commentary, was purely incidental and not a calculated titillation serving to reveal to the 
photographer's audience a different kind of essence lurking beneath the mask? No, Casby's portrait was constructed 
precisely because Avedon wished it to be consumed both aesthetically and ethnographicallv. The portrait was made 
for the picture gallery or tor the coffee-table book. To put Avedon's portrait side by side with those of his African 
contemporaries, such as Seydou Keita or Cornelius Yao Azaglo Augustt, delimits the mask and calls it into question. 
The projects of these two great portrait photographers from Africa undress — in part through the dialogue thai 
existed between sitter and photographer — the pretense of excavating a deeper meaning from the subject, a meaning 
that ethnographic framing assumes as its lens pans across the body of the othered subject. 

We can name in our aid three important technical elements in the interesting contest ol power that ethnographic 
authority employs in solidifying its scientific foundation: camera placement and lens angle, the position ol the 



25 



photographer in relationship to the suhject, and the "natural" environment selected by the photographer to enact 
the subject's authenticity. Elaborating on this technique and framing or authenticity, Edwards writes, "The 'real' or 
the 'natural' or 'authentic,' and the elements selected to represent that reality, depend on the status of the objects 
concerned within the overall classification of knowledge and the representation or those objects in a way which will 
be understood as 'real by the viewer." " In examining the entire spectrum in which photography worked in collusion 
with ethnography and anthropology to both frame and undermine our knowledge of Africa, Edwards continues, 
"In anthropology 'significant' structures of a culture are observed, the fragments of informants recorded and the 
final work born of synthesis and then generalization; the fragments become moulded to a unifying account of 
culture'. So, in photography, the specific moment becomes representative of the whole and the general."" 

For the ethnographer, the African subject functions and exists in this delimited terrain to better yield access to 
the kind of knowledge that the pseudoscience of nineteenth-century phrenology skillfully appropriated. It is not 
the subject depicted who is really of interest but what he or she is supposed or ought to represent, what the body 
type reveals. Stripped of the most rudimentary of human attributes, of speech, choice, and subjectivity, the subject 
might as well be a piece of dead wood. In this case, the African subject — who neither signifies nor embodies 
consciousness — is beyond redemption and is, in Conrad's words, "a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving 
knowledge." 

Negritude, Pan-Africanism, and Postcolonial African Identity 

The emergence of the concept of negritude in the late 1930s, in particular as a dialectical framework in the 

development of African and Caribbean postcolonial literary discourse, is also pertinent to the broad discussions 

that flow from this exhibition. The first appearance of the term negritude was in the startling epic poem by the great 

poet Aime Cesaire of Martinique. In "Cahier d'un retour au pays natal" ("Notebook of a Return to the Native Land"), 

published in 1939, Cesaire set down the psychic and temporal order that would come to define this very important 

branch of modernism. He writes simultaneously out of righteous scorn and penetrating irony: 

on friendly light 

on fresh source of light 

those who have invented neither powder nor compass 

those who could harness neither steam nor electricity 

those who explored neither the seas nor the sky but those 

without whom the earth would not he the earth 

gibbosity all the more beneficent as the bare earth even more earth 

silo where that which is earthiest about earth ferments and ripens 

my negritude is not a stone, its deafness hurled against the clamor of the day 

my negritude is not a leukoma of dead liquid over the earth 's dead eye 



26 



27 



my negritude is neither tower nor cathedral 

it takes root in the red flesh oj the soil 

it takes root in the ardent flesh of the sky 

it hreaks through the opaque prostration with its upright patience' 

1 hough Cesaire originated the word, its conceptualization and subsequent growth as a cultural movement were 
not his alone. The Senegalese statesman, poet, and essayist Leopold Sedar Senghor was Cesaire's partner in giving 
negritude its stamp and urgency in the tepid dawning oi Fascism under the gray skies or Europe. Negritude's founding 
in Paris shortly before World War II was based on a fundamentally modernist vision intermixed with the ideal oi 
an originary essence of African identity. 1 his ideal, however, relates more to Senghor's beliefs, which were rooted 
in a hind of archaic revisionism, than to Cesaire's more fragmentary, indeterminate Caribbean syncretism. T he 
dates of negritude's emergence coincide more or less with the earliest works in this exhibition. 1 his connection is 
not coincidental. 

As negritude's tenets were taking hold (mostly among young Francophone African and Caribbean intellectuals 
in Paris such as Leon Damas, David Diop, Rene Depestre, Frantz Fanon, and Tchicaya U'Tamsi), the irreversible 
changes that would eventually inaugurate the struggle for the end of colonialism were being forged by the Pan- 
African ideology of Nkrumah and the "scientific socialism" supported by Anglophone intellectuals who rejected 
Senghor's negritude and Africanite as essentialist particularism, both emotional and regressive. At a writer's 
conference in 1962 in Kampala, LIganda, the young Wole Soyinka (who in 1986 was named Nobel laureate in 
literature) of Nigeria retorted with disdain, while discussing negritude, that "a tiger does not go about asserting its 
tigritude." A few years later, in 1966, poet Christopher Okigbo rejected an award he had won in Senegal on the 
grounds that it was based on the absurdity of race and ancestry. Benin's minister of culture, philosopher Pauhn 
Hountondji, criticized Senghor's position because he avoided political issues and was "engaged in the systematic 
elaboration of 'artificial cultural problems. ? The points of these attacks are to be found in Sentihors unshifting 
position vis-a-vis Africanite, negritude, and the past. Often, his beliefs seem dangerously close to the ideas of 
nineteenth-century scientific anthropology, which privileged notions of originary essence. For example, benghor 
emphasized the past at the expense of the present. He wrote, "There is no question of reviving the past, of living m 
a Negro-African museum [our emphasis]; the question is to inspire this world, here ana now, with the values oi our 
past."" Another bombshell that had intellectuals scrambling to the lectern for a rebuttal is this assertion: " I he 
Negro is a man of nature. . . . He lives off the soil and with the soil, in and by the Cosmos. . . . [He is] sensual, a 
being with open senses, with no intermediary between subject and object, himself at once subject and object." 1 he 
"Negro-African museum evoked by Senghor's words is at once a recombined theory Oi essentiali.-m awd a 
recapitulation of Gobineau. 

Negritude's rejection by many African intellectuals on the grounds that it was revisionist and regressive seems to 
be confirmed in the photographs made by Joseph Moi'se Agbojelou, Mama Casset, Salla Casset, Meissa Gave, awd 



27 



Keita in the same period. Nowhere in their works do we detect the sitters' desires to live in that so-called Negro- 
African museum. In fact, what we see is their reluctance to be confined in such a natural-history or ethnographic 
setting. Looking at the majestic portraits of the worldly and sophisticated men and women who frequented the 
studios of these photographers, we find the unique intersection and cross-referencing of notions of tradition and 
modernity. Even Senghor himself sat for a portrait by Salla Casset. These photographs produced just before World 
War II and thereafter contest Senghor's Africanite, an ideal rooted in an almost incontestable, primal authenticity, 
which was drawn from the powerful residues of oratory and represented by the griot and traditional folklore. 

The interpretation we may draw from this vehement cultural and ideological dispute is that the African self- 
image in the late 1930s and the 1940s was already being radically transformed. The subjects of these photographs 
are the electorate who would cast the decisive vote for independence and initiate the radical break with colonialism. 
Indeed, the subjects of these portraits are African, but they are not contained by the questionable episteme of 
ethnographic delectation and otherization. Their subjectivities and desires in a modern and modernizing Africa 
conflict with the Senghorian interpretation of an originary African essence. For if, as he argued, tradition was the 
mother of the primal essence, then technology no doubt should have represented its antithesis and negation, an 
incendiary apparatus imported from the West to deracinate and desacralize tradition's deeply planted taproot. But 
technology in the modern world was never the antithesis or negation of tradition. What simply happened, as James 
Clifford notes, was that "after the Second World War, colonial relations would be pervasively contested. . . . Peoples 
long spoken for by Western ethnographers, administrators, and missionaries began to speak and act more powerfully 
for themselves on a global stage. It was increasingly dif ficult to keep them in their (traditional) places. Distinct ways 
of life once destined to merge into 'the modern world' reasserted their difference, in novel ways." 

Before World War II interfered with the drive for self-governance, Africa's sense of itself was changing. Like 
James VanDerZee in Harlem, New York and Richard Samuel Roberts in South Carolina, Mama Casset, Salla Casset, 
and Gaye had already established studios in Dakar and Saint-Louis, Senegal that catered to the elite and common 
folk of those cities. They methodically documented an important milieu in that negotiated space bridging the gap 
between colonial and postcolonial identity, between the self and the other, between modernity and tradition. Keita 
set up a studio in Bamako, Mali at the end of the 1940s, largely continuing the same kind of portrait work, but 
with a lyrical, modernist sensibility that is as fresh today as when his photographs were made. The aforementioned 
photographers popularity as the preeminent image-makers of their time is attested to by the presence of their works 
i n many f ami ly col lections. Encountering their work today, we feel ourselves deeply embedded in a site of recognition, 
in a temporal zone between the pathos of loss and rejuvenation. Their photographs chart an ontological space, a 
period of modern bistory that has remained largely neglected. 

The existence of photographs of the 1940s provides us with an insight into the diverse and complex sensibilities 
that made up the face of Africa as it entered a new era. The images give us access to vivid, but by no means complete, 
visual records of a continent gripped by, yet emerging from, the political, economic, social, and cultural structures 



28 



imposed by colonialism. Given their incompleteness, these photographs represent only a part oi that visual 
history created and documented by Africans. Many or them, such as the cache or photographs borrowed for this 
exhibition from little-known family archives in Senegal, are difficult to trace and hard to locate. T hey nevertheless 
exist. This vast archive or images staged ror posterity remains a crucial testimony. Today the photographs reside 
scattered and buried in colonial archives, obscure private albums, and commercial business records that have either 
been abandoned, neglected, or totally forgotten. This hoard remains for historians and archivists to retrieve, 
catalogue, interpret, and preserve ror future generations. 

The present exhibition constitutes part or that effort. In examining issues or modern and contemporary African 
representation and identity, and the interpretation and dissemination of history, it calls attention to a continent 
whose long historical traditions have crossed, touched, and influenced all the consequential byways of human history. 
That Africa has long been disparaged by innuendo and misrepresentation, its contribution to history eluding 
comprehension and appreciation over the years, in part accounts for the selection of photographs in the exhibition. 
We have passed over images of wretchedness and misery, of disasters, genocide, war, hunger, and dictators — plentiful 
elsewhere — in order to celebrate Africa, to throw its artistic modernity and contemporaneity into sharp relief. 

In presenting African visions, the exhibition also suggests how their staging testifies against the dominant notions, 
preconceptions, and normative codings entrenched in modernist iconography. What we seek to reveal is a whole 
transactional flow that refutes both Senghorian negritude's salvage paradigms and a complacent Western historicity 
of morbidly inscribed ethnographic yearnings, lusts, prejudices, appropriations, and corrosive violence. I tie 
exhibition presents an African subjectivity from east to west, from north to south, emerging out of the entire 
continent's multiracial, multiethnic, multilinguistic, and multireligious realities. The continent was also caught up 
in the dystopic upheavals of modernity, whose currency — from Pablo Picasso's and Georges Braque's Cubist 
pastiches to Henri Matisse's Orientalism and Breton's Surrealism — was built on a syncretic practice of quoting, 
renovating, and discarding disparate elements refined across cultural borders. In crossing those borders, signs of 
authenticity disintegrate, disparaging all claims to an originary essence or purity. 

Clifford thoroughly challenges "such claims to purity" and essence as they have persistently marked 
and circumscribed African representation. He writes that such claims (which, in any case, simultaneously represent 
negritude's and Western ethnography's attitudes) "are always subverted by the need to stage authenticity in opposition 
to external, often dominating alternatives." ' It is by no means an exaggeration when Clifford notes that something 
happens "whenever marginal peoples come into a historical or ethnographic space that has been denned by the 
Western imagination. 'Entering the modern world,' their distinct histories quickly vanish."' But he goes lurther in 
amending and supplementing this view of quickly vanishing cultures by contesting a cultural reading based on the 
preservation of "endangered authenticities." Thus, he suggests that "geopolitical questions must now be asked of 
every inventive poetics of reality." But "Whose reality? Whose new world?" he asks. 

Africa is no different from other places in the shifting, indeterminate landscape of current world conditions, 



29 



in which every process of cultural texturing goes through a comhinative loop of excisions and additions to contradict 
the persistent ethnographic dramatization of otherness. From the sense of "impurity" and "^authenticity," 
we observe that when "intervening in an interconnected world, one is always, to varying degrees, 'inauthentic': 
caught between cultures, implicated in others. Because discourse in global power systems . . . elaborated vis-a- 
vis ... a sense of difference or distinctness can never be located solely in the continuity of a culture or tradition. 
Identity is conjunctural, not essential."' 4 In a global system under rapid transformation, "who has the authority to 
speak for a group's identity or authenticity? What are the essential elements and boundaries of a culture? 
How do self and other clash and converse in the encounters of ethnography, travel, modern interethnic relations?" 3 
Here, purity becomes incapable of performing even a metonymic duty, embedded as it is with inauthenticities. 

Portraiture, Reality, and Representation 

Prior to the period of independence, those representations of Africa's social reality available in the West were the 
work of European photographers. The ubiquity of these photographs produced in mass numbers as souvenirs 
obscures the existence and availability of work by African photographers who were active in the colonies as 
early as the 1860s. A. C. Gomes, for instance, established a studio in Zanzibar in 1868 and opened a branch in 
Dar es Salaam later on; N. Walwin Holm started his business in Accra in 1883 and was, in 1897, the first 
African photographer inducted as a member into the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain. Other 
photographers active during the later part of the nineteenth century were George S. A. Da Costa (in Lagos from 
1895), E. C. Dias (in Zanzibar in the 1890s), and F. R. L. Lutterodt (of Ghana, who worked in Accra, Cameroon, 
Gabon, and Fernando Po in the 1890s). Many other names are currently lost to history. 

The material available on these photographers suggests that they were not (either thematically or historically) 
linked to the decline and the disintegration of European colonial dominance. Nor could we say that they were 
involved in any way in the destructuring of European hegemony in African existence. Since very little early 
photography by Africans is available publicly, it would be difficult to claim their production as the embodiment of 
some counterdiscursive native sensibility in an insurgent photographic practice that could have overthrown the 
imperialist mechanisms of European invincibility and superiority. Within artistic practice, the reclamation of 
African subjectivity, in any kind of considered manner, existed within the practice of painting, in what Olu Oguibe 
identifies as a reverse appropriation in the work of the Nigerian painter Aina Onabolu, who was working in Lagos 
during the early 1900s and in Paris in the 1920s. Kobena Mercer identifies the same process at work in Mama 
Casset's portraits of the 1920s and 1930s. He writes: 

Whereas the depiction of Africans in prevailing idioms of photo-journalism tends to imply a vertical axis which literally looks 
down upon the subject, thereby cast into a condition of pathos and abjection, Mama Casset's portraits are often set on a 
diagonal whereby the women he portrays seem to lean out of the frame to look straight out to the viewer, with a self-assured 
bearing that evidences an interaction conducted on equal footing. 3 '

This positioning and sense of confrontation coincide with the reflective discourses advanced by the Arrican 
liberation struggle, discourses that affected the work of the portraitists represented in the exhibition. I hus, the 
period of independence, which began roughly at the end of World World II and ended in the early 1 ^ /('-, was not 
a period of amnesia, tabula rasa, and newborn Africanity, but a time of sociopolitical resurrection, reassessment, 
and transformation. The temptation to search for some sort of "natural" or "pure" state of African photographv 
emerging from this period is great. lo proceed from such an assumption, which anticipates an allegedly original 
photography and an "other" photography, would overlook and mar the very existence and repercussions of the 
colonial enterprise. On the other hand, it conforms to the idea of an imagined "dillerence" that marks borders 
around those "other" cultural practices, isolating and fetishizing them. This hind of paternalistic identification thus 
separates the viewer from African cultural production and from the social conditions that have shaped its form-. 
At the same time, it reaffirms the imaginary unity of Western photography and the myth of its own distinctiveness, 
authenticity, and superiority. 

Likewise, in assuming the illusion of an allegedly universal photographic language, we may be reinforcing the 
systematic process and hegemonic position of Western projection, identification, and appropriation. Too often, 
many Western critics, curators, and scholars, instructed and trained within the theoretical frame of Western 
photography, seem predisposed to applying their presuppositions to non-European photographers or artists, thus 
ignoring or dismissing specific sociocultural situations and ideological conditions that inform artistic practice in 
other regions of the world. 

Kwame Anthony Appiah discusses an instance of Western projection in his revealing In My Father's House: Africa 
in the Philosophy of Culture: " I he French colonial project, by contrast with the British, entailed the evolution o! 
francophone Africans; its aim was to produce a more homogeneous francophone elite. Schools did not teach in 
'native' languages, and the French did not assign substantial powers to revamped precolonial administrations. You 
might suppose, therefore, that the French project of creating a class of black 'evolues' had laid firmer foundations 
for the postcolonial state." Appiah also asserts that "the majority of French colonies have chosen to stay connected 
to France, and all but Guinee . . . have accepted varying degrees of neocoloniat supervision by the metropole," 
either culturally, militarily, or economically. And, in most cases, the colonial languages of the British, French, and 
Portuguese remained the languages of government after independence, according to Appiah, "for the obvious reason 
that the choice of any other indigenous language would have favored a single linguistic group." These arrangements 
and policies might have been the only compromising response to the fact that not even the new states with the 
smallest populations were ethnically homogeneous: "The new states brought together peoples who spoke different 
languages, had different religions traditions and notions of property, and were politically (and, in particular, 
hierarchically) integrated to different — often radically different — degrees." 

Ironically, in this period that promised African independence lrom Europe, the liberation struggle was humiliated 
through many visions and schemes that were ideologically, culturally, and politically articulated within European 



31 



history and philosophical traditions. Both Senghor's Africanite and Nkrumah's "scientihc socialism" were nothing 
more than Eurocentric ideas projected and presented either as Africa's own self-conception (in the case or the 
former), or as a universal and globalized paradigm that unequivocally occluded African historicity and its concrete 
political and cultural existence (in the latter). If the former internalized and ontologized racism, as Tsenay 
Serequeherhan pointedly evidences in his piercing analysis of Senghor in his book The Hermeneutics of African 
Philosophy: Horizon ana Discourse, the latter, by employing the abstract and universalizing language of Marxist- 
Leninist idealism, subordinates African existence to the terrain of a homogenized historicity determined by the 
"historical logic" of the international hegemonic power of the Western proletariat and of European modernity. 

Other writers, statesmen, and intellectuals associated with the African liberation struggle, such as Cesaire, 
Amilcar Cabral, and Fanon, focused instead on establishing an African political tradition grounded in African 
historicity. They articulated a critique exposing the contrast between the unfulfilled promises and ideals of African 
"independence" and the political realities of the new states. Aware that newly independent African countries were 
still connected to colonial attitudes and values, they enunciated a notion of liberation as a process of reclaiming 
African history. l The "return to the source" established by Labral as the basic direction for the movement he 
directed in the 1960s in Guinea-Bissau is not, however, a return to tradition in stasis; nor is it engaged, as 
Serequeberhan explains, "in an antiquarian quest for an already existing authentic past." On the contrary, in 
"returning," the "Westernized native" brings with him "the European cultural baggage that constitutes his person," 
absorbing the European values into a "new synthesis." Serequeberhan elucidates, "In this dialectic European 
culture/history is recognized as a particular and specific disclosure of existence, aspects of which are retained or 
rejected in terms of the lived historicity and the practical requirements of the history that is being reclaimed." 

The works of photographers like Agbojelou (working in what is now Benin), Augustt (Cote d'lvoire), Mama Casset 
(Senegal), Salla Casset (Senegal), Gaye (Senegal), Keita (Mali), Moumoune Kone (Mali), Boufjala Kouyate (Mali), 
and Youssout Traore (Mali) are instilled with the euphoria and the disappointment, the pride and the insecurity, 
the confidence and the contradictions of this period of transformation. Even if none of these photographers directly 
problematized cultural, political, and social issues of colonialism and postcolonialism, they employed narrative 
means that contribute to unraveling the issues under discussion and to situating them within the specific historical 
and ideological framework of the African experience of this period. Taken as a collection of disparate images and 
aspects of traditional and modern forms and effects, these photographs reveal African societies in flux. Even 
Agbojelou s traditional and more luxurious portraits of weddings and other political, cultural, and religious 
ceremonies offer tradition as something alive, not sealed in the antiquity of a "reconstructed" culture. 

In general terms, the portraits by these photographers are descriptions of individuals as much as they are 
inscriptions of social identities. Although most of them are frontal poses of individuals and groups in the 
photographers studios, the portraits expose as much as they hide from view through the complexity and 
sophistication o\ representation. Set as they are within a historical model of photographic configuration, these 



32 



portraits are not necessarily telling any "truth" about their subjects, but, as products ol signification, they are claiming 
a specihc presence in representation. Portrait photography, in general, creates the illusion or fixed, immutable 
presences in images rendered as real bodies. When we pose, we either imagine what people see when they look at us 
and then try to act out this image, or we want to look like someone else and imitate that appearance. We imitate 
what we think the observer sees, or what we see in someone else, or what we wish to see in ourselves. 1 his process 
or reconfiguration and acting out or an ideal is what is so fascinating in the character studies ol Alrican studio 
portraiture. It evidences not only a social transformation but a structural and ideological one, in which the complex 
negotiations or individual desires and identities are mapped and conceptualized. 

Probing how the subject inserts itsell into this matrix, Peggy Phelan, following Jacques Lacan, asserts: "Like a 
good correspondence, the model's reply to the inquiry or the photographer is based on the quality or the 
photographer's question. Portrait photography is the record or the model's sell-inquiry, an inquiry framed and 
directed by the photographer's attempt to discover what he sees. Models imitate the image they believe photographers 
see through the camera lens. Photographers develop the image as they touch the shutter; models perform what they 
believe that image looks like. And spectators see again what they do and do not look like." " As is the case with all 
portraits, those by these African photographers vacillate between glamorizing the sitters and uncritically reflecting 
their projections and desires. These portraits do not only render reality; they penetrate and evaluate it. These 
portraits are archetypes, models for the way their sitters wanted to appear. The portrait is, therefore, the outcome 
of an elaborate constitutive process. As John Tagg writes: "We cannot quantify the realism of a representation simply 
through a comparison ol the representation with a 'reality' somehow known prior to its realisation. The reality ol 
the realist representation does not correspond in any direct or simple way to anything present to us before 
representation. It is, rather, the product ol a complex process involving the motivated and selective employment ol 
determinate means of representation." 

While reminiscing on that transitional period of the late 1940s, Keita comments that, by then, "men in town 
began to dress in European style. They were influenced by France. But not everybody had the means to dress like 
that. In the studio I had three different European outfits, with tie, shirt, shoes, and hat . . . everything. And also 
accessories — fountain pen, plastic flowers, radio, telephone — which I had available for the clients. Most or Keita s 
pictures depict individuals in traditional African clothing, but the variety, elegance, or origin of these clothes 
(already cultural inscriptions in themselves) is not precisely what these portraits emphasize; what they reveal is then- 
own sociocultural value as signiners ol status and their functional role in the construction and transiormation of 
identity. 

Keita also recognizes that he helped his models to find ways to look their best. In his studio, tie displayed samples 
ot his photographs so customers could choose how they wanted to look. "I suggested a position which was better 
suited to them, and in effect I determined the good position," Keita admits. His clients were as conscious ol their 
poses as of their dress and accessories. All elements amount to the construction ol solemn images composed as 



33 



signs of wealth, beauty, ana elegance, which act — with the complicity or the photographer — as surrogates for the 
essences of their subjects. 

The clients and subjects of portraiture by Salla Casset, Gaye, ana Keita are primarily family members and friends, 
civil servants, bureaucrats, society ladies, and well-to-do people. Confirming his own position as a sought-after 
photographer, Keita comments, "Even our first president of the Republic [of Mali] came." 44 Most of the photographs, 
whether taken inside or outside the studio, place the models against plain or patterned backgrounds. In most cases, 
the backgrounds isolate the model with accessories and props; particularly in Keita's majestic photographs, they 
may blend with the subject's clothes, emphasizing the faces. Despite the realism and purported individuality and 
particularities of these portraits, the generic solid or decorative backgrounds and the props give them an abstract 
quality. Certainly, Casset, Gaye, and Keita were not trying to create or document a taxonomy of social types, but 
the generic character of such elements seems to counteract the subjectivity of individual models. 

Portraiture in Africa recorded how models wanted to be remembered, or inventoried their past; sitters could then 
witness their own (or somebody else's) transformation as well as the disappearance over time of customs and cultural 
symbols. While the portrait, as a memento mori, could suggest a pathos to the model in its reminder of mortality, 
it could also be put to societal uses. Much of the most stimulating work of Augustt, for instance, consists of portraits 
made for identity cards in the mid-1960s. They are technically as sharp and clear as Keita's, but stylistically 
straightforward and uncomplicated. Augustt's portraits, of the poor, workers, job-seeking rural people, and others, 
make up a much broader social sampling than Keita's. The head-on-stare of Augustt's models evokes a cross between 
the mug shot, documentary photo, and old-fashioned studio portrait, although the portraits themselves assert an 
unusually modern quality. 

Portraits also have religious functions in different African cultures. In a continent where technology is always 
narrated as being at loggerheads with tradition, photography — from the moment it was conscripted into service to 
create funerary objects — has been renovating and supplementing an existing tradition. Within this context, the 
portrait, in addition to being a presence in the world, carries great symbolic value, for it is said to represent the 
spirit of the subject, as an index, a pure trace of the body. In various African cultures, photographic portraits have 
been appropriated so that the images are perceived, almost literally, as surrogates tor the body. Families cherish 
them. They protect and guard them against evil spells and ill will. Their codes and meanings, their aspect of liminality 
between the realms of the seen and the imagined, are invested, almost, with the potency of magic. Christian Metz 
writes about photography having the character of death. Photography, he notes, "is a cut inside the referent, it cuts 
off a piece of it, a fragment, a part object, for a long immobile travel of no return." ? While this scenario essays 
photography as a fascinating outtake of immobility, we would argue the opposite, that the portrait as the object of 
an elaborate funerary enterprise exists in a rather complex metaphysical location, where it is subsumed within many 
traditional codes. Rather than being fixed in the immobility of death, the deceased's portrait is rescued from that 
still ether of abjection by the performative surrogacy enacted by the synecdoche of metaphysical transference.

] hus in various contexts, the portrait's meaning in Arrica possesses its own distinct codes, its own play ol signitiers. 
It enters into the service or myth and letishism when its perceived opticality is turned into a rich and complex held 
or signs invested with ritualistic meaning. In eastern Nigeria, among the Igbos, the portrait has come to occupy the 
realm or the immanent. Alter a person dies, his or her portrait is usually placed on a bed and addressed by mourners 
as il it were the live person. In such moments ol private communication, the portrait serves as a totemic symbol 
that banishes the death and projects more than a likeness. It also serves as an aid lor eternalization, rixing tne 
subject within the temporal space ol remembrance. 

Another example ol the portrait as part 01 the accoutrements ol Itinerary ritual is lound in Ethiopia. In the 
1880s, photography was, according to Richard Pankhurst, "assimilated into the country's traditional structures. 
Prior to this assimilation, it had been customary lor mourners in luneral processions to display the eihgy ol the 
deceased along with his personal belongings. This tradition was translormed with the introduction ol photography. 
Panhhurst writes that "with the advent ol the camera such articles tended to be supplemented — and the elrigy even 
replaced — by photographic portraits ol the departed which mourners held high above their heads, while they wailed, 
ritualistically, and perhaps recounted episodes ol the deceased's lire and achievement." ' Another example ol 
portraits used as objects ol ritual perlormance can also be lound in wejr, the Yoruba cult ol twins, which Ogiube 
discusses in this catalogue. 

The works ol Samuel Fosso ol the Central Alrican Republic enter another type ol photographic perlormative 
space by drawing on concepts ol mimicry and by expanding, enacting, and theatricalizing the relationships between 
and limitations ol identity and representation. Fosso's sell-portraits suggest that, in the transiormative atmosphere 
ol the 1970s (a period that, as a result ol the legacy ol colonialism and neocolonialism, was still entangled in 
struggles lor independence, social upheavals, civil wars, and revolutions), Alrican male subjectivity was located in 
disguise and displacement, in the negotiated space between the construction and dissolution ol identity. Much in 
the same manner that Lindy bherman would later analyze stereotypes ol women, in 1976 Fosso started a large 
series ol sell-portraits picturing himsell disguised as dillerent and easily recognizable "types," in which the presumed 
"reality" they reler to is interestingly absent, as il they were anonymous characters. In Fosso's work, these characters 
are like reliquaries in the theater ol the imagination. The photograph has lost the naivete that, to some degree, 
commanded the composition and aesthetic decisions ol earlier portraitists, who were still somehow allied with the 
"reality" ol their subjects. Fosso openly undertakes and absorbs photography as a degeneration ol that reality, as a 
corruption ol any stable representation. 

Social Narratives 

In addition to the buoyant economies and political shiltings alter independence, some Alrican countries were 
marked by declining living conditions lor rural populations, increasing dependency on Western trade practices and 
controls, an mtensilication in the looting ol archaeological sites, a general squandering ol Arricarj cultural 



35 



patrimony, ana the deceptions, contusions, and displacements related to the sociopolitical experience or many 
African cities. During the 1960s and 1970s, all or these prohlems were still caught in a web or uncertainties and 
the domination or the colonial powers. Thus, while some cities (like Bamako) prospered as a result or their 
relationship with and aid from Western nations (France and the United States), others (like Maputo, Mozambique) 
were the victims or the imperial (Portuguese) refusal to give up power without violence. In very general terms, these 
contrasting economic and political realities gave rise to opposing social experiences — one or tranquility and leisure, 
the other or war and devastation — which, in turn, guided many African photographers toward social issues and 
engaged them in the voluptuous, traumatic extremes or the Arrican metropole. 

Malick Sidibe or Mali focused his attention on the young metropolitan youth or Bamako who gathered and partied 
at city clubs, which were named alter their lavorite idols, such as the Spoutniks, Wild Cats, and Beatles. Even 
though Sidibe saw himself as a practitioner or photo-reportage, his 1970 series oi photographs (see pp. 90—93) 
gives us a privileged, private vision or then-contemporary conventions and artifices or young Malian metropolitans, 
as they danced the twist or the jerk, or moved to the beat or Cuban music. These photographs convey neither the 
casual character nor the lluency and naturalness or photo-reportage. An insider, Sidibe had the confidence or his 
subjects, who commissioned him to record their activities. Most or these photographs were posed, stylistically framed 
to accommodate Sidibe's interest in social interaction. This is particularly clear in the series or photographs Sidibe 
shot by the Niger River, ten kilometers rrom Bamako, depicting the Sunday activities or the young. While they may 
have been sell-conscious subjects lor Sidibe's documentary lens, they were also the inspiration lor his artistic 
achievement. 

Ricardo Rangel's photographs (see pp. 94—101) are more stirring and emotionally charged than Sidibe's, as was 
Maputo in comparison to Bamako. Mozambique's war ol liberation was particularly long, lasting throughout the 
second hall ol the 1960s and the 1970s. The country became independent in 1975, only to lace a horrifying 
guerrilla war launched first under the instigation ol the racist, illegal regime ol Ian Smith in Rhodesia (now 
Zimbabwe) and later, alter Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, led by Pretoria's apartheid terrorists. The enduring 
and devastating consequences ol these prolonged conllicts are recorded in the poignant and contrasting realities 
captured by Rangel over his lengthy career. His photographs, however, are not just documents ol an agonizing period 
ol isolation, poverty, and social downfall, but the subjective vision ol a talented photojournalist critically engaged 
with his country's liberation from colonialism. 

Although it seems that his photographs preserve the character of photo-reportage (piercing across all sections of 
Mozambique s social fabric, excavating Maputo's underbelly while the war of independence raged outside), Rangel 
imbued nis varied subjects with that same kind of sensitivity and transcendence found in the work of other socially 
concerned photographers such as David Goldblatt, Santu Mofokeng, and Nabil Boutros. Rangel's celebrated 
photographs of the prostitutes — women without names, jovial and sad, nameless women with their wigs and 
provocative clothes — who were a familiar feature of the bars and corners of Maputo's Araiijo Street express their 



36 



mixed emotions through an incommensurable subjectivity, while simultaneously conveying an impenetrable 
feminine identity. 

The increasing interest over the decades in documenting the varieties and contradictions or African realitv is 
most apparent in photography in South Africa, although it is certainly strongly evident in work from Gfuinea and 
Mali as well. Today, those extraordinary achievements can be seen in the works of internationally recognized 
photographers such as Goldblatt and the Drum magazine contributors Bob Gosani, Peter Magubane, and jiirgen 
Schadeberg. Their photographs not only capture various lifestyles of South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, but 
also the political upheavals that brought apartheid to the world's attention. 1 he work of Mofokeng, who was trained 
by Goldblatt, comes out of this tradition, expanding it to encompass the artist's interests in the discourses of 
representation. 

Goldblatt's pictures (see pp. 102—07) are commanding photographic essays. They expose the many aspects and 
faces of an immeasurable South Africa: its landscapes and people, its mines and small towns, its complacency and 
repressed joy. Little in these images hints at a social urgency, for Goldblatt did not document South Africa per se. 
Rather, he was looking for what he describes as "something of what a man is and is becoming in all the particularity 
of himself and his bricks and bit of earth and of this place and to contain all this in a photograph." 4 ^ He was hunting 
for revelations, essences of his country's core, extraordinarily clear, quintessential details, at once recorded by and 
existing apart from the picture. His 1960s series devoted to Afrikaners is remarkable precisely because it grasps 
that "something." These photographs show not only the faces of apartheid, its leaders and henchmen, its intimacies 
and "innocence," they also bare its very soul, the aspect of its lurking terror. 

Mofokeng uses techniques from straight documentary photography to address the politics of representation, in 
an exploration of his place in South Africa's polarized society. Thus, he positions himself as a witness who brings 
to his images (see pp. 119—24) social awareness, formal refinement, and aesthetic complexity. By means of this 
successful combination, he affects contrasting and highly lyrical compositions that resist both explicit political 
interpretation and a reduction to purely formal terms. Mofokeng is not interested in bold statements or in 
individualities. What his photographs made throughout the 1980s convey are the common threads, the familiar 
contexts, and the shared experiences of blacks in the townships of South Africa, through the artist's poetic sensibility 
as one who shares their reality yet is aware of his own potential to intrude or misrepresent. None of these pictures 
is a contrived narrative; none of these images is cliched. As Walker Evans might have commented, "It is prime 
vision combined with quality of feeling, no less." 

Like Goldblatt and Mofokeng, Egyptian-born Boutros combines in his photographs (see pp. 113—18) the 
impelling forces of two allegedly opposing photographic traditions: one related to the aesthetic and formal tenets 
of painting, the other focused on recording the factual world. The former quality in Boutros's photographs stems 
from the fact that he started his artistic career as a painter. Evident in his work — from refined portraits to desert 
landscapes to nocturnal views of Lairo — is his interest in creating narrative structures and character studies that 



37 



are capable ox transcending their details, of rendering the essence of Egypt. His photographs conjure the sensuality 
and perfection of form, which is infused with a quasi-visceral quality. The result is an almost abstract association, 
an "air," that, as Boutros's work reminds us, is precisely what Barthes called animula, "that exorbitant thing which 
induces from body to soul." 

Although seemingly removed from this urge to document the process of Africa's liberation from European systems 
of reference, Mody Sory Diallo's almost abstract photographs of 1994 (see pp. 125—27) show the walls of the 
infamous Camp Boiro, where those who dissented from Sekou Toure's Marxist-Leninist dictatorship in Guinea 
were detained and tortured. The subjects of these pictures are not the walls themselves, but the erased presence of 
those who inscribed upon them words and symbolic signs of their resilience. This commemorative drive impels 
Diallo's current goal of creating an agency to collect and archive existing political and cultural images in order to 
preserve the fragmented memory of his homeland. 

The North African Paradigm 

If it has seemed throughout this analysis that photographers from sub-Saharan Africa have focused mainly on the 
human form, its social context, and how it is represented, a review of their North African colleagues suggests other 
distinctive concerns. Historically, along with economic impediments, Islamic prescriptions could explain the fact 
that in Egypt, for instance, even though photography was introduced in the first half of the nineteenth century, 
most photographers were either Westerners or Christian Armenians until very recently. The Islamic aniconic 
mandate, the prohibition against realistic representations of the body, was strictly observed and was, therefore, a 
very strong inhibitor of photography's acceptance. In 1839, when the first photographs arrived in Egypt, the Khedive 
exclaimed, "This is the work of the Devil!" But we may find a similar response even in Germany. In his essay "A 
Short History of Photography," Walter Benjamin quotes the denunciation published by the Leipziger Stadtanzeiger 
around the same time: 

To try to catch transient reflected images is not merely something that is impossible hut, as a thorough German investigation 
has shown, the very desire to do so is blasphemy. Man is created in the image of God and God's image cannot be captured 
by any human machine. Only the divine artist, divinely inspired, may be allowed, in a moment of solemnity, at the higher call 
of his genius, to dare to reproduce the divine-human features, but never by means of a mechanical aid. 

I bus, these variances in the work of North African photographers have not resulted from specific cultural differences 
alone. The tendency toward abstraction and the interest in a more lyrical, sometimes metaphysical, approach can 
be understood as the desire to escape the stereotypes that Orientalism imposed on photographic representations 
of the Arab world. 

I n the case of writer and photographer Mohammed Di b, photography is a projection onto a presence, and a present, 
that is the future of a time past. As an artifice against death, photography, like writing for Dib, suspends time to 
capture the fleeting moment, to give it an eternal present. There is nothing in his images that is imprecise or 



38 



tentative. On the contrary, as in a poem, everything serves a purpose and is strictly irreplaceable. In his pictures of 
anonymous people and architectural compositions (see pp. 83—89) made in Algeria during the 1940s, Din did 
not search tor a truth, hut for the impasses of the everlasting. 

Although time is not the main impetus lor the photographs or Kamel Dridi ( 1 unisia), Lamia Naji (Morocco), 
and louhami Ennadre (Morocco), their works procure Tor themselves presence and meaning through a sense or 
time. In striving to capture the transience or light, Dridi searches for what Micnket Kriia aptly describes as "the 
magic moments or chiaroscuro's offerings.""" In Dridi's sensual photographs, these offerings are the radiating 
presences or light within the shadows or mosques and other interiors. The transitory, however, is best illustrated in 
Dridi's fugitive images or a praying woman, the 1978 series depicting his mother (see pp. 128—35). In them, that 
shared desire to look at, to verily, and to give resolution to reality remains unsettled, always immanent hut never 
completely gratified. At most, the viewer is left impassive in that indeterminate predicament of the transitory, 
somewhere perhaps between the promise of the future and death. 

Working in the 1990s, Naji devotes her photographic practice (see pp. 137—42) to the unraveling o! light within 
darkness. For her, they are inseparable. In confronting darkness, she may cast upon it those uncertain features id 
herself that she may suspect she has, or her most obscure desires. This transference provides an opportunity to 
liberate light within the scene of its concurrence with darkness and to allow for the possibility of discerning the 
difference between darkness and its projections. Each photograph becomes, consequently, a spiritual quest for 
discovery, an opening to self-knowledge. 

Inspired to take pictures at the time of his mothers death, Ennadre has embarked on a quest beyond that which 
prompted Barthes to write Camera Luciaa; Ennadre's concern is not the preservation of a photographic memory, 
the ensnaring of a fleeting presence, or the restitution of that which has been lost. It is true that Ennadre recognizes 
that his work "is simply a kind of witness to this person [his mother] I once knew." In his photographs, nevertheless, 
this witnessing is experienced as a traumatic event, an encounter with a supreme moment, or an ultimate experience, 
in which the space between life and death dissolves, erasing any trace of time, that purloining agent. Through a 
great variety of subjects, Ennadre has always presented his images within the experience of that moment of collusion 
between life and death. Perhaps his 1982 pictures of a stillborn baby exemplify this borderline with the most 
startling and potent evidence (see pp. 146—51). Francois Aubral asserts that Ennadre is fascinated with "the moment 
of truth in which death is already there and life has just ceased to be.""" d he overwhelming darkness in these works, 
perhaps not paradoxically, is what gives presence to them and grants life to that powerful moment ol transition. 

By contrast, the world of Jellel Liasteli — who, like Ennadre, is based in Paris- — is one ol light, the incomparable 
light of his childhood in Tunisia. At its most blinding, lignt in his work not only transfers an atmospheric ellect, 
hut creates a softly geometric abstract environment. I he redundant, disembodied quality ol his li^ht suggests the 
opposing qualities that Krifa mentions m relation to Dridi's light, Gasteh does not use lignt to emotional ellect, 
but its resplendence and its texture allude, not to the visual images themselves, but to what they insinuate. In his 



39 



White Series (Serie blanche) of trie 1980s and 1990s (see pp. 143—44), the repeated theme iunctions as an element 
in a plot; a means or restitution and memory or his childhood, it evokes narrative without offering a culminating 
visual image. In his work, the vanished past and its restitution hy means or photography may remain mysterious, 
out they are never implausible. 

Imaginary Territories, Symbolic Homes 

It has been argued that the exemplary site of postmodern consciousness is rooted in exile and diaspora, where 
boundaries are repeatedly effaced and defaced. The twentieth century is seen as the embodiment of the age of mass 
immigration, refugees, and displaced people. Exile and diaspora carry debilitating connotations: romanticism and 
loss, ambivalence and desire, memory and estrangement, myths of authenticity and origin. For many, the process 
of crossing boundaries is hardly an appealing option. In his essay "Reflections on Exile," Edward Said notes that 
"exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience." He sees its manifestation, especially within 
the violent erasures organized and orchestrated by modern warfare, imperialism, and the quasi-theological ambitions 
of totalitarian rulers, as an "unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and 
its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted. 

Many African artists seem caught in this insurmountable vector, hemmed in by a constant state of 
emergency. In addition to physical destabilization, they endure a daily tight against erasure by the subjective 
practices and representations of their new symbolic homes, while attempting to hold on to the frayed and wilting 
memories of imaginary territories considered to be original homes. The Africa of the twentieth century eludes 
factions of origin. Where on the map might we locate Zarina Bhimji, a Ugandan artist of Asian origin who lives 
in London? Or Bleach, a Zimbabwean of British origin living in the United States, or Ike Ude, Oladele 
Ajiboye Bamgboye, and Fani-Kayode, three relocated Nigerian artists who grew up in the United States, Scotland, 
and England, respectively? Or even Goldblatt, whose parents, escaping from czarist oppression in Russia, 
settled in apartheid South Africa? Or those North African artists who live in the dreary shadows of France's return 
to racial essentialism? Such are the actively lived contradictions of the African experience. They raise 
difficult questions about the notion of origin and authenticity, revealing the bald fictions of essentialism. Beyond 
the pale of their recollected histories, all these artists bear the scar of exile in the sense of living a double 
consciousness. 

: home is the palace of memory, Ude reconstitutes its faded forms by building, via the all-pervasive archive, a 
critique oi its representations. The archive, of course, is suitably useful to photography. In Uses of Evidence (1996) 
(see pp. 171 — 76), Ude coopts its character to query two opposing values and perspectives: representation and 
knowledge. In his installation, which literally mimics the exterior and interior of a physical structure, he sets up a 
dichotomy between what is represented and revealed as knowledge on tbe outside, and what is hidden or made 
nonexistent on the inside. However, this suppressed and willfully concealed information, as Ude argues, must be 



40 



made available to a fruitful examination of trie erasures and misrepresentations fault into ethnographic practices. 

In developing the work, he has considered how the images could potentially contradict and supplement that 
commonly accepted knowledge. 

In this sense, we may view Uses of Evidence as a manifestation of both a physical and a psychological construct. 
In the installation, the exterior shows photographic murals of Iarzan, wildlife, and frenzied crowds of "natives" in 
states of dispossession, display, and distress. Culled from media sources and quasi-scholarly documentary materials, 
these appropriated images serve as useful reminders of how Africa is recollected through the lens ol the West. In 
the interior, he creates a hushed melancholic ambience, a hermetically sealed world where he installs images from 
private family albums and archives. The portraits represent loved ones and friends in the context of their 
contemporary realities. This wallpapered interior, inaccessible to us except through cutouts that metaphorically 
suggest picture frames, evokes a kind of terrible beauty, a world lilled with sweet sorrow, loss, and memories. On 
the one hand, the interior's configuration alludes to the questions of idealization that Sigmund Freud links to his 
conceptualization of love. On the other hand, the exterior accentuates those moments of ambivalence that Julia 
Kristeva denotes as the abject. Uses oj Evidence explores how the disparate materials (though divided into two fencea- 
off groups) converge to define the same subject, opening up dangerous chasms for both oppositionality and 
romanticization. Ude mediates this potential conflict by building into his work a critique that questions assumptions 
and memories of Africa. 

Bamgboye, on the other hand, obviates the role of the appropriationist in the self-portraits, interiors, and 
landscapes he renders as videos, light boxes, and photographs, which are constituted out of performance and props 
standing as repositories for cultural symbols and stereotypes. Out of memory and identity, both blurred by cultural 
relocation, Bamgboye presents himself in his substantiality in his photographs (see pp. 165—67). He departs from 
the traditional literal representation of self-portraiture in a truer assault on the real, to rediscover himself and to 
establish some sort of intersubjective relationship with the viewer, by which the emotional and the speculative can 
be bridged. In this way, Bamgboye avoids fetishization and availability as object, deconstructing the sexual codes 
projected on the African male body and demythicizing his own role as photographer and sitter, as can be seen in 
the image from the 1994 Puncture series showing a wound in the genital area (see p. 165). Bamgboye refuses to 
idealize himself in many of his light boxes, trying not so much to enthrall the real, but rather seeking, like Francis 
Bacon, to render the reality of the subject beyond its circumstantial characteristics, so as to keep no more than its 
biting essence. Bamgboye concedes to Ludwig Wittgenstein's comment, "We need friction. Away from the smooth 
ground!" 

Friction is precisely what Fani-Kayode suggested in the last series of photographs (see pp. 1 52 — 5 / ) that tie made 
before his death in 1989. I hese beautiful color photographs are informed by Fani-Kayode's attention to the fact 
that "the great Yoruba civilisations of the past, like so many other non-European cultures, are still consigned by 
the West to the museums of primitive art and culture" and that "the Europeans, laced with the dogged survival of 



41 



alien cultures, ana as mercantile as ever they were in the days or the Trade, are now trying to sell our culture as a 
consumer product."^ Fani-Kayode was also conscious or his own potential complicity in sanctioning such a 
consumerist role. He wanted to avoid any acquiescence to the "reconstructed ethnicity" that accentuates the 
classification or collectible and tourist art objects into stereotypical ethnic categories. He outlined a territory in 
which he could "reappropriate such images and transform them ritualistically" into contemporary images or his 
own creation. This complex, fabricated territory makes the established assumptions about black-male representation 
counterfeit by averting a single, obvious meaning or point of reference from which the viewer may activate the 
systematic routines of projection, identification, and appropriation. " Fani-Kayode used masks and indecipherable 
signs and symbols of Yoruba cosmology not to promote an artificial recuperation of precolonial tradition, but to 
complicate and diffuse the viewer's experience of the work, creating some kind of cultural and sexual friction, fn 
this sense, we can understand Fani-Kayode's practice as parallel to "the Osogbo artists in Yorubaland who themselves 
have resisted the cultural subversions of neo-colonialism and who celebrate the rich, secret world of our ancestors." 

Bleach positions his work in the theoretical, but by no means impractical, problematic of the camera as truth- 
teller and calls into question the camera's stable order. He turns the camera's versatility against itself, subverting 
its existence as an apparatus for encoding on the two-dimensional a visible, material object in space. Bleach's 
carefully orchestrated photographs of his 1991 "CRYPT series (see pp. 158—63), in which the process of their 
production determines the end product, is supported by photography's two constants of time and space. Within a 
fixed time, he performed repeated traversings of a self-determined triangular space, which become in the photographs 
residual marks. Because of the long exposure and the split-second intrusions of his body in the viewfinder, his 
repeated walks were evidenced upon the him only by the coding of the intense flashlight he carried as he moved his 
body through the space. 

The calligraphic, squiggly emanations that float on the surface of his photographs are like agitated maps, visual 
and mental palimpsests. The making of these photographs draws from a series of relationships between time and 
space, inscriptions and erasures, presences and absences, constructions and deconstructions, coding and decoding, 
all of which are staged over and over. What we encounter in the space (observable as a result of the arc of light and 
the large-format camera's long exposure) has little to do with the transposition of a physical referent onto our plane 
of vision. What is revealed is only the referent's echo, a self-portrait turned into signs, like EKG patterns, a map 
of the body's insubstantiality. As a lost form, the body's absence becomes a suggestion supported by time and 
tremulously held in a space littered with the ghostly forms of other worlds and imaginary landscapes, which slowly 
disintegrate into memory. 

In Bhimji s work, the human body (taxed by racial innuendo and embroiled in the Logos of mutation and 
dirlerence) is encountered as a vast archive, abstracted and absorbed by mechanisms of social, scientific, and legal 
control. In the places she photographs, access is barred to all but the most privileged. By entering and photographing 
in tlu\-r U- rr 1 1, •rii.-, she calls attention to issues of representation and their relationship to sites of power. She reveals 



42 



now collected information, translated a~ knowledge, is vetted and organized, sorted and regimented, activities mat 
often omit the unsavory. Bnimji's orientation contests these processes, opening them to new probings and 

determinations. 

Bhimji brings a peculiarly nineteenth-century sensibility to her photographs ol human-body parts and membranes 
collected and sealed in formaldehyde. \et, it could be argued that her work departs radically I rum the objectihcation 
of abjection, disease, and abnormality that Victorian photography cast onto its studies ol human anatomy. I he 
elaborate stagings of her photographs, whether taken in hospital wards, doctors' offices, or pathology laboratories, 
or as part of her study of eugenics, comprise a Foucaultian reading of photography's fascination with the human 
body as a site of disintegration and degeneracy. Her focus questions the terms of the body's depiction, while also 
bringing to attention its violation in moments of ritualistic violence, mutilation, distortion, and dislocation. 
Bnimji's morbidly sensuous color photographs of hospital wards and laboratories transport the viewer to forbidden 
worlds, places or sorrow, loneliness, and terror, or exile and dislocation. We go to the spaces in which she works 
either to get well or to die. Visiting them is an incommensurate experience, which Bhimji s work throws sharply 
into relief. We lind ourselves cast afloat on a sea of abandonment, where we are always incomplete and where time 
defeats every facility of consciousness. 

As the twentieth century draws to a close, and the world becomes engulfed in an end-of-millennmm anxiety that 
also looks toward the future, does Africa, in spite of the marginalizing imperatives of its past history, share in this 
outlook? Can we indeed mark the end of the influence of Western ontologizations about Africa, at least within the 
grid of representation? The answer to these questions is a resounding yes. On a political and social level, the 
dissolution of colonialism in many parts of Africa in the 1950s and the subsequent emergence of the postcolonial 
states provided the first opportunity for its reversal. Secondly, the recovery of a subjective African awareness of its 
own responsibility as a key voice — speaking not only out of its past but its contemporary realities — within the 
shaping of world culture has been very important. With a multiplicity of cultural specificities and identities, Africa 
thus reengages these fraught questions with new knowledge and self-images. Indeed, this exhibition, with its diverse 
voices and aesthetic philosophies, reveals avenues to that transcendence. The work of the thirty photographers m 
the exhibition bears testimony to this endeavor and to the means through which African subjectivity can be freed 
and detangled from Western epistemological constructs and colonial structures. 

Looking at the diverse works through an ostensibly Western gaze, we are struck by their forceful, though nut 
necessarily conscious, intentionality. Written across the photographic images is the inherent problemali/.ation of 
that gaze, which tends to place the African subject in a matrix encoded within ethnographic memory. On the most 
fundamental level, this disjunctive between what the African photographer sees and what the ethnographic lens 
remembers lies at the core of the exhibition. Ibis contest, in which the Alrican subject is limned across the 
phantasmagoric screen occupied by the respective positions of the spectacle and spectator, challenges how viewers — 



43 



Western and non-Western alike — will grapple with the images in this exhibition. Or great importance is how the 
viewer's perception might possibly be enmeshed with that ethnographic memory. Kaja bilverman notes that these 
processes or enmeshment ana the production or stereotypes or otherness by projecting ana distancing provide "the 
imperative to get back to those images that provide the rantasmic grounding tor all or our rantasies and object 
choices."'" Whatever the rantasies and desires or the viewer engaging these images may be, the intentions or both 
the photographers and the complexity or their radical visions delimit these choices while challenging and opening 
new critical perspectives rrom which we may reexamine our relationships to Arrica, its history, and its identities.

win cnwezor 



"Dates have a fundamental significance in the annals ol South Arrican history," said a South African friend ol 
mine as we drove through one or the high-walled, manicured suhurhs 01 Johannesburg. "Rut arc dates any less 

significant in the annals of other countries' histories?" I thought to myself. Nothing in the speaker's voice, however, 
possessed any hint of irony. In tact, he was in earnest, thus leading me to attune my eyes and ears to the perpetual 
presentness of South Africa. For there, the violent and bloodied past does not habitually invade the present, hut 
coexists with it uneasily, as an illegitimate authority, a desecrated memory. I nlikc those places where collective 
amnesia (as in the case of Holocaust deniers) aids state structures to el lace the el lects ol horrible crimes, in South 
Africa, dates, as indispensable as they are painful to invoke, are actively kindled moments, in addition to being 
symbols of recollection and temporal gauges used to define certain vast spaces subsumed within memory and history. 
Dates animate the often hoarse, raspy, and acrimonious core or the nation's political and social discourse. For the 
South African majority, they are essential, their significance no small measure. For this majority, dates are like 
memorials that haunt the often elusive ground of solace, from the legacy of the Boer Trek of the 1 830s and 1840s 
to the overgrown tombstones that commemorate the sixty-nine victims of the Sharpeville massacre of I960. 
Recalling how violence is manifested under dictatorships, Charles Merewether writes that in its mechanisms there 
is "a vested interest in removing from consciousness the death of people in order to displace memory as an active 
element of hope and the impulse of collective consciousness. Terror is anonymous 111 nature, while mutilation and 
disappearance avoid identification so that human identity and death are desacralized." It is precisely this persistence 
or violence in South African history that, in many ways, defined lite for many people on the margins, orten dislocating 
them to a no-man's land of dispossession, to that chasm where "immense agiireoates of humanity loiter as refugees 
and displaced persons." 

From the time the Dutch arrived and established a trading post for the Dutch East India Company in 1 652 in 
Cape of Good Hope, the story of South Africa has been one of occupation, colonial pillage, and contested territories, 
histories and identities. The introduction of apartheid in 194-8, after the electoral triumph of the Arrikaner 
National Party, gave birth to a succession of laws including the Population Registration Act ( 1 950), which allowed 
the government to classify people on the basis of race and color, and the Group Areas Act (1950), which authorized 
the forced removal and physical separation or people along racial lines. The Native Laws Amendment Act ( I ^52) 
ushered in the notorious pass laws, which curtailed and controlled the movement ol Arricans within South Axrica. 
As apartheid's agenda was solidified, each law introduced under its aegis — such as the Separate Amenities Ac I 
(1953), Bantu Education Act (1953), and Separate Development Act (1 955) — further decimated any indigenous 
participation in the fragile polity fabricated by the British and the Boers. I hese laws, which always carried the threat 
of violence, beleaguered any notion of a shared and representative national culture or identity, which inevitably led 
to a protracted, internecine struggle for freedom. 

In a sense, the long struggle against apartheid forced South Africa to bear the greatest burden among all the 
"modern" nations in qual living lor that designation. Simply put, it was a]\ outlaw country. Everything in its rancorous

history of well over three centuries pointed out the anomalousness ol it- -lain- a- a "modern" nation. And even 
when pretentiously applied, such adjectival qualification amplified the hollow Bound emanating from the utterance 
of that noun. For South Africa was never a nation. Its renegade governments worked diligently tor the greater part 
of the twentieth century to uphold, for its Caucasian minority populace, the facade of its destiny as a nation, a place 
in which only the tiniest number of people were deemed to hold rights as citizens. I his notorious disregard tor 
international standards conferred upon South Africa and its "citizens" the &gt;td t u~ oj international pariahs, thus 
isolating the country for decades. 

In February 1 990, when Nelson Mandela walked out a free man from the Victor Verster prison m Rohhen I -land, 
after twenty-seven years of confinement by the apartheid regime, the country took i t ~ first tentative steps toward 
acknowledging the monumental wrongs of apartheid and its brutal political, economic, and cultural repression. 
Four years later, on April 27, 1994, after the first democratic elections, South \l rica became united as one under 
a nonracial democracy, the African National Congress government led by President Mandela. I he elec tion ushered 
in the first concrete platform for the rejection of codified racism as state policy. Finally, South A I rica could he said 
to have truly entered the modern era. Yet, in spite of its new democracy, bouth Africa remain- heavily shadowed 
and haunted by the fundamental breach of its past. Indeed, it cannot escape the many years oi censure, nor can it 
so easily obliterate pain and bitter memories. 

And, thus, to enter South Africa today is to step into the harsh glare ol two opposing conditions: one that i^ 
assertive, welcoming, tolerant, forgiving, optimistic, hopeful, reconciliatory, and determined to move forward; the 
other tentative, distrustful, intolerant, intransigent, xenophobic, pessimistic, sell-righteour-, and regressive. I )uring 
my stay in Johannesburg this past January, I thought about South Africa s reality in term? of these paradoxes, in 
terms of its actively lived contradictions and its dividedness. This division is rendered starkly when one takes the 
short drive from the heart of cosmopolitan Johannesburg (with its high gates and ubiquitous iconograph) oi hci^ 
reading "24-Hour Immediate Armed Response") to the much different world ol Soweto, twelve kilometers away. 
Yet, this contrast does not in itself fully suggest the country's rich complexity, fascinating character, and beauty. 

Beyond Renaissance and Awakening: 1950s South Africa and Drum 

Our aeepest /ear is not that we are inadequate. 

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 

It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us. 

We ask ourselves, who am I to he brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous ? 

Actually, who are you not to be? 

— Nelson Mandela 

Brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous: these were the qualities used by many South Africans in the townships during 

the 1950s to define the substance of their lives, the peak ol their coming to voice. Pi 1 1 unit and unfathomable as 



181 



it might seem, given the bleak prospects oi existence under apartheid's hegemony, lire was nonetheless lived with 
relish in many townships, precipitating a rare period that, today, many rememher wistfully. It is almost as it the 
millions who later would he railroaded and systematically destroyed by the pernicious apartheid policy anticipated 
that the decades ahead would be devoted solely to the struggle to assert and reclaim the validity or their rights as 
empowered human beings and citizens. Jurgen Schadeberg, the first picture editor or Drum magazine and a highly 
respected photographer, who documented many or the memorable moments or the decade with sharp clarity and 
great compositional skill, notes, "The 1950s were exciting years. The ideas, the ideals, and the achievements or 
that time should not be forgotten." Peter Magubane, who brought an intimate humanism to his photographs and 
with equal ardor left a legacy or great images from the period, spoke to me about how unbelievable that period was 
in the now- vanished Sophiatown, then known as the Paris or Johannesburg. He recalled its hedonism, joy, romance, 
and sense or place. 

In an attempt to extract the lull essence or the period, "Doc" Bikitsha writes that "terms like renaissance or 
awakening do not do justice to it." He further notes, in a tone nourished by undisguised sadness and a sense or loss, 
that the decade or the 1950s in South Airica "was a period or unequalled black fulfillment and achievement. . . . 
The period could, in my opinion, be described as one or miracles. These miracles were reflected in the writing, 
politics, trade, fashion, sport and other activities. And there were talented writers who recorded all this glory and 
triumph. In the forefront or the recorders or this historic period were the Drum school or writers." 

When Drum's first edition was published in Cape Town in March 1951 under the name The African Drum, its 
first editor and cotounder, Robert Crisp, with typical white bouth Alrican attitudes toward Africans, envisioned it 
as an entertainment magazine dealing with aspects or "tribal" lire, even though its target was an urban audience. 
Not perceiving themselves in the stereotypical and racist light under which Lrisp attempted to cast them, the African 
populace at whom the magazine was directed roundly rejected its message. T he African Drum was a failure, a vital 
lesson its subsequent owner would heed. After three issues were produced, Jim Bailey, the son of a mining magnate, 
took over the magazine as its sole proprietor, a role he would play until he sold the publication in 1984. Bailey 
changed its name to Drum, restructured its editorial direction, and moved its offices to Johannesburg. In order to 
ensure its survival, he had to radically reformulate the magazine's image as a forum for Crisp's condescending, 
imagined ideas of African "tribal" life to a sophisticated outlet for young journalists, writers, and photographers. 
Bailey brought from England the twenty-five-year-old Anthony Sampson, an old friend from Oxford, to serve as 
the magazine's editor. A few years later, having solidified his base in South Africa, Bailey expanded the parameters 
of Drum so that it became a quasi-continental organ. Added in succession were editions in Nigeria (1953), Lihana 
(1954), East Africa (1957), and Central Africa (1966) to fulfill that pan-African determination. 

At the height of its popularity, Drum enjoyed enormous readership. Even a North American and West Indian 
edition was distributed. The magazine's circulation per issue stood at 450,000 copies, reaching far into many 
literate, cosmopolitan areas of Africa. But more than anything else, it was Drum's keen insight into Africa's popular

culture, contemporary life, and emergent sense ol modernity that garnered wide devotion among tkis urban audience. 
With equal vigor — as well as measured discretion, tor Drum could easily be banned like so many otker public ations 
presenting anything antagonistic toward apartheid — Drum also conl routed serious Bociopolitical issues within it- 
pages. The magazine was witness to the worsening political and economic conditions in South Airica, and the 
independence and liberation struggles in Central, hast, and West Alrica. The names ol those political figures 
appearing in Drum are deeply inscribed on the pages of world history: Ohafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi A/ikiwv, [omo 
Kenyatta, Patrice Lumumba, Albert Luthuli, Nelson Mandela, loin Minna, Kwame Nkrumah, fulius Nyerere, 
Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, and others. Dru»i&lt; various editions also covered momentous events buc n as the drawn 
outTreason Trials that lasted several years in South Alrica, the Mau Man uprising in Kenya, the Accra conference 
for Pan-African unity in Ghana, the Kabaka of Buganda's exile by the British, the capture ol Lumumha In General 
Mobutu's forces in Congo, and the independence movement in Nigeria. 

Writers like Peter Abrahams, Ayi Kwei Armah, Nadine Gordimer, Alex La Guma, aim\ Lewis Nfcosi contrihuted 
essays and stories to tbe magazine. It was also in Drum that Alan Paton's bestselling novel Cry, the Beloved Country 
was first serialized. Of its staff writers in the 1950s, Arthur Maimane; Casey Motsisi; Ezekiel Mphahlele, who 
would later migrate to Nigeria and become a professor of literature; I lenry Nxumalo, known as Mr. Drum lor 1 1 i - 
ability to take on very difficult assignments; and Can 1 hemba stand out like beacons. I heir stories gave enormous 
texture and shape to the mood of the period, examining its politics, fun, culture, aspirations, even its petty crimes 
and capturing in words the fast-paced and changing lifestyles of various communities, such as Alexandra, Orlando, 
and Sophiatown, some of which would disappear forever. 

Drum's photographers gave visual substance and glamour to the lives that comprised the intimate portraits of 
those stories. With equal scrutiny and attention to their diverse subjects, be they celebrities, hoodlums, or politicians, 
the photographers took pictures in the segregated, teeming, vibrant slums id South Alrica s townships. I heir in ia need 
images display an expressive freshness and energy borne out of an irrepressible nope and optimism. I he 
photographers looked for their images in the most unexpected places. 1 hey donned disguises and had themselves 
arrested, whatever it took to obtain images to illustrate important stories. Schadeberg went to great lengths cor the 
convict-labor story, as did Bob Gosani for the prison story, Magubane for the mine-workers story, G. 1\. Naidoo 
for the children's hospital story, and Lionel Oostendorp for the story ol a drowned "C olored boy. Mill, in the end, 
Drum was less a voice of political consciousness than it was an entertaining lirestyle magazine covering concerts, 
singers, nightlife, weddings, gangsters, shebeens, beauty contests, and other social events. 

By casting a critical gaze at territories that existed beyond the margins, the work ol the Drum photographers 
transcends the prosaic. Offhandedly charming or accusatively caustic, the photographs are more like sociological 
excavations than purely documentary artifacts. By defying the conventions ol traditional documentary photography, 
these pictures ably penetrate the surface of appearances to probe the psychological states ol their subjects as well 
as their environments. Envisioning the circumstance.- ol their production, we are struck by their deep implication.

There is never a dull moment in the stories the photographs tell. For example, Ian Berry's intimate ana revealing 
view of lire in the capacious hut suhterranean world or the Moines' drag culture, shot at the famous Madam Costello's 
Ball in Cape Town, poignantly captures that group's racial intermixture and its air of camp, sadness, and joie de 



vivre. 



Stepping away momentarily from South Africa's bureaucratic and statutory taxonomy oi racial and social 
differentiation, we enter the vihrant scene or Ghanaian youth culture captured by the lens or Christian Gbagbo, 
Drum (Ghana)'s principal photographer. His eclectic pictorial investigations utilize a descriptive technique to focus 
attention on a spectrum or subject matter, rrom the active political environment or royal visits and Pan-African 
conferences to the music scene. One or his stories centered around the frenzied, happy-go-lucky world or the Tohio 
Joes, the flamboyant, stylish, and funky youth or Accra. With their suavely modern way or lire, which drew on the 
international influences or the English teddy boys and the thumping beat or rock and roll, alongside J. T Mensah's 
lilting songs or urban romance, the Tokio Joes signed their name onto the map or a new era. 

In Nigeria, Mathew Faji's photographs connected viscerally with the core or a country that commanded 
the immense respect or its neighbors. His camera went beyond the urban metropolis, which he mythicized 
in dramatic tableaux or assorted pop stars, beauty queens, and expatriates, soccer mania and murder mysteries. 
Faji reached into the active fulcrum of the political intrigues and scandals of Nigeria, which gained 
independence in I960, photographing his various subjects with an intense realism that nevertheless eschews 
overdramatization. Faji's photographs of Nigeria's multicultural society make up a polyphonic enunciation of 
emancipatory promise, an essential record of the collective experience with which his country attempted to step 
into the future. 

Drum represents more than a mere publication in the minds of many people. It was a window into their aspirations 
and desires, and, in many ways, it was an eyewitness to those events defining the course of South Africa's 
political and social landscape in the years following World War II. It fulfilled an important role as a documenter 
and a disseminator, especially if we consider the magazine's importance in the African context. In the current 
exhibition, the selection of Drum materials has been limited to those from the 1950s and 1960s in South Africa, 
Nigeria, and Ghana, rather than including its later years. The photographs from Drum demonstrate how 
photojournalism functioned and transported ideas as nations were emerging from or entering different milieus in 
that vital period. 

It could be said that Drum was at the outset an onerous Eurocentric conceptualization of excess in service of a 
complex typology privileging Africans' alleged difference from accepted codes of civility. But what demands even 
greater attention are the strategies by which the selfsame Africans, having recognized and rejected the crudity of 
The African Drum's attempt to falsify their identity, subverted that conceptualization. Equally pertinent is how the 
writers and photographers of Drum brought to the fore ideas about disparate African subjectivities that existed

apart from the constructs oi trie colonial enterprise, beyond the brooding fictions and fears apartheid concocted to 
legitimate its annihilating procedures. 

In many ways, the work of the Drum photographers exists beyond the realm of the visual and assumes an important 
ideological function, occupying a phantasmagoric space of the real, making concrete the manifold experiences 
captured by the camera. Merewether, in contrasting the manner in which photojournalism is embedded in the 
activities of the public sphere with that of photographic portraiture's tendency to address the private sphere, notes 
that "the difference between the two is not simply a matter of genre and style, but the way photography transgresses 
and redefines the subject of taboo, that is, notions of the sacred, of intimacy and the private sphere." We can access 
the full meaning and importance of Drum's photography through such transgression and defiance, which in many 
instances came with serious repercussions. Thus, with penetrating authority, the seductive, albeit compelling, 
images from Drum name "through an accumulation or excess of memory" the divided and irradiated space of 
desanctified memory. As such, the publication of Drum in the 1950s and 1960s remains vital and provides a key 
platform disturbing the various hedges erected by a repressive political order. It also provides real grounds for 
discursive narratives involving issues of desire, identity, and community as we map different cultural moments in 
Africa. Although these issues might be looked upon today as the last province of postmodern epistemological 
closure, their enunciation opens up routes to many discourses that will continuously demand elaboration, as long 
as photographic practice by Africans remains a fruitful and engaging encounter.

7. Under apartheid's racial classification system, anyone considered neither Caucasian nor Indian (also known as Asian) nor African 
(Bantu, Native, or black) fell into the in-between category of Colored. That category conferred upon the bearer certain richt^ that were 
routinely denied Africans, ameliorating the hardships that Africans encountered daily, such as being required to carry passbooks and 
being barred access to good jobs, public establishments, Caucasian areas of town, and other civic amenities. To be Colored was thus to 
sit on a hierarchical position above that of kafjir (what would be termed "nigger" in American parlance).

10. As with most dictatorships, mere suspicion of hostility toward the apartheid regime was met with brutal force. No form oi media 
frightened the regime more than photography did, with its powerful testimony that could be used to expose and counterat t the sanitized, 
propagandistic images working in the government's favor, or to fashion an oppositional artistic practice of sell-representati.nl. Mlagubane, 
for example, was incarcerated, spending nearly six hundred days in solitary confinement, and was banned by the government lor rive 
years, during which he was not permitted to practice photography.

over 300 men and women from more than 25 African countries who had gathered for the conference. Their subject was the future of Africa. The delegates were at the 
conference for two reasons: to work out how best Africa could be freed from colonialism and imperialism; and to set the foundations for a Union of Independent African 

States. Accra 's Community Centre Hall was crowded to hear the opening address of Dr. Nkrumah. . . . The hall was draped with flags, and on one of the walls was a map of 
Africa with slogans which were the theme of the talks: "Peoples of Africa unite. . . . We have freedom and human dignity to attain. "

There is the story of the day he "fought" a winning tussle with a Volkswagen bus at Diobu, near Port Harcourt. Uzoma had been abused by the driver for refusing to step out 
of its way. Uzoma didn 't mince words, but promptly took hold of the vehicle from behind and held on while the driver started the engine and tried to move off. But so great 

was his strength that the vehicle didn 't budge. Only when the driver had apologised did he let go.

Peter Magubane, "A Day at the Races." Drum (South Africa), July 1958 

The cynics say it s a game for the needy, the greedy and the seedy. Tradition says it's the sport of kings — and presidents, too. But the ordinary guy is saying more and more. 

"It's the game for me. " Just now the excitement is mounting because soon the biggest race in the South African racing calendar — the Durban July — will be on. All the 
country's top horses will be there, and folks are already putting on their best dreams for the occasion. It's the common meeting ground, the 'July. ' Doesn't matter if you're 
white, black, financier or tsotsi. the bookies are prepared to take your money — and prepared to pay out if you can find that exclusive winner. Success: it was a winner all the 

way. And boy. were the odds generous! First a little jig. and then off to the office to collect.

Miss Amaranee Naidoo, a shy and attractive young girl who was at one time too nervous to ride a bicycle, has won fame throughout Natal, South Africa, by her daring 
escapades on the Wall of Death. And while other girls of her age are wondering who their next "date " will be, she often wonders if she will be alive for another date.

G. R. Naidoo, "This Is a Hospital." Drum (South Africa). February 1958 

At Weenen, a small farming town in Natal, there is a hospital where the conditions are perhaps more shocking than at any other in South Africa. Tuberculotics sleep almost 
one atop another on bare floors. Patients suffering from other diseases and illnesses mix freely with the tuberculotics. and in fact sleep together. In one ward, children sleep 

under the beds of the men patients.

Johannesburg kids think up new crazy crime; they set victims alight with benzine and drug themselves into a daze with the stuff. The benzine kids, so called because of their 

habit of inhaling benzine fumes until they're tipsy, as if they have smoked dagga. are a batch of young kids aged from 8 to 14 who have their headquarters at the Bantu 

Sports Ground. Johannesburg. They call themselves the "Fuku Ranch " and their headquarters also serve as their home. Most of these kids grew up in the dust and blood and 

poverty of the slums of Moroka. Pimville. Orlando Shelters and Alexandra although a dash of them are Evatonians.

Mr. Holyoake, the Coloured who was classified as a 'Native. " has won his appeal with the Reclassification Appeal Board. He is Coloured again. From the end of 1955 the 

Coloureds have been harassed by the need for the reclassification of their racial status in terms of the Population Registration Act of 1950. To be reclassified as an Afncan 

could, everybody understood only too well, mean a whole new train of daily embarrassments and disabilities, but hundreds of Coloureds went over to the Native Affairs 

Department, and there came up grim stories of comb and pencil tests, nose and ear inspections and of people being summarily classified as African.

It all started with the huge, compelling party poster splashed magnetically over Johannesburg. The poster also carried a controversy, sensitive as a winter blister. There would 

be shows for Euros only and shows for Non-Euros only. All this would take place at the Johannesburg City Hall. There the music, song and dance of the townships would be 

presented by the Union of South African Artists. So if this Union claims to champion the cause of us Blacks, why the heck should they go in for segregation and separate 

audiences and black dates and white dates? At the end of the seventh show. Township Jazz moved to the Taj Mahal Night Club where the artists and friends were treated to a 

party to celebrate the success of the run.

Photography and the Substance of the Image Olu Oguih&lt; 



Compared to all other image-making techniques and preoccupations that we loosely refer to .1- the visual arts, 
photography has come a long way in a very short time. Today, the hand-held contraption thai George Eastman built 
in Rochester, New York in 1 888 to take advantage o! the roll film he had developed has 30 advan&lt; ed and proliferated 
that we are ottered models so inexpensive we can discard them after only one use, thus completely belying the fa&lt; t 
that just over on&lt;; hundred-and-fifty years ago it required a hill on the floor ol the French parliament, sponsored 
and promoted by some 01 the most powerful minds of the age, to obtain Irom the governmenl anannuit) for Louis- 
Jacques-Mande Daguerre in exchange tor the rights to his photographic process. And the ever-burgeoning business 
enjoyed by photo-processing laboratories and drugstore counters around the world today Brio* - thai our attat hment 
to the photograph has not waned since the publication in 1840 ol that witty lithograph by Theodore Maurisset, 
La Daguerreotypomame, which captured the craze tor the photograph gripping Parisian society and also predicted 
many or the developments that have taken place in photographic history. Photography lias allowed us to share images 
01 locations and sites as remote as the farthest corners of our galaxy and as intimate as the innards ol our own 
hodies, and it has placed at our disposal records of events and likenesses 01 personalities both close and distant: the 
exhilarating moment or the delivery 01 a child, as well as the stini; 01 the hour ol departure; the family group 
miniature set on an office desk as a sign or respectability, as well as images o I the powerful with which we underline 
our own connections, or allegiances, to power. 

Photography arrived in Africa on November 16, 1839, the same year that Daguerre announced his invention 
in France and less than two months after the Englishman D. W. Seager made the first daguerreotype in the I nited 
States. But for the sabotage of the painter and amateur photographer Horace Verne t, who made the first images in 
Egypt in 1839, the earliest photographic images by an African, whicn were produced by Vernet's patron and 
benefactor, the Khedive and Vice-Regent of Egypt, Mehmel, could have also appeared in that same year. Melnnet, 
who had marveled at the image-making possibilities ol the photographic process, lost little time in li i~ desire to 
understand and take control of this process, to wrest from Vernet the power ol the new technique, and to apply it 
to the reproduction and preservation of images of his spouses, lo this we shall return shortly. Soon alter Vernet 5 
pictures of Egypt appeared in Europe, photography and the camera became a permanent part 01 European campaigns 
of exploration in Africa, sometimes with relative success but often woefully unsuccessful and remarkahl) vain. 
Nicolas Monti has suggested, with much merit, that the culture oi tourism had 1 1 ~ very beginnings in the lucrative 
European trade in photographic images of Africa. As a result of the graphic representations 01 aspects 01 African 
life, created by adventurers and colonial personnel through the photographic process, many people were drawn to 
the continent not only by the geography thus revealed but also by a new, more convincing and eminentl) enticing 
portrayal of the alleged sensuality of the African. And bo successful was t h i ~ commerce ol images thai by the turn 
of the century, American photographer F. Holland Day was manufacturing studio images ol "Nubians and 
"Ethiopian chiefs" shot in America with African American models, .1 voyeuristic, typecasting practice that would 
eventual lv be manifest, in its worst lorm, in the junglefication 01 Africa by Hollywood in the following century. 



231 



As the voyeuristic camera made inroads into Airica, so did the camera as an instrument or war. By 1855, the 
English photographer Roger Fenton had established the camera as a tool or war reportage through his coverage or 
the Crimean War, and by 1861, Mathew Brady had begun to apply Frederick Scott Archer's collodion process to 
the pictorial documentation or the American Civil War, leaving behind moving images or loss and horror rather 
than records or triumph. In both cases, the camera was, quite arguably, very much a journalistic instrument rather 
than part or a military campaign. In its earliest wartime use in Airica, however, the camera was a tool ideologically 
posited decidedly on the side or incursion. In 1896, Edoardo Ximenes, an Italian journalist and coiounder or the 
magazine Illustrazione italiana, brought war photography to Airica as a reporter on the Italian campaign in Abyssinia. 
Accounts or Ximenes's exploits in Abyssinia indicate his position in iavor or the Italian iniringement upon that 
Alrican nation. And Ximenes was not the rirst photographer in Ethiopia. The man credited with introducing 
photography into Ethiopia, in 1859, the German missionary Henry Stern, had himseli been imprisoned lor 
"displeasing" Emperor Tewodros II, thus discouraging the use or the camera in that country until later in the century. 
The camera would eventually play a iateiul role in the politics or the great Abyssinian monarchy in the early twentieth 
century, ultimately leading, ror the rirst time in world history, to the rail or a monarch and presaging the dubious 
employment or photography in the McCarthy era in the United States. 

Although it is known that Khedive Mehmet acquired command or the daguerreotype process irom Vernet shortly 
alter its introduction in Egypt in 1839, inrormation on Arrican photographers working beiore the turn or the 
century is scarce. While this in itseli does not, ol course, demonstrate, as some would have us believe, the absence 
or Arrican practitioners or the art, nevertheless we do not rind records and images specifically attributed to them — 
and which provide us with an insight into the nature and purposes oi Alrican photography — Irom much beiore the 
turn ol the century. In explanation, Monti indicates possible cultural impediments to the acceptance and propagation 
or the photographic medium, one ol which is a superstitious misgiving about the camera and its magical abilities. 
But this was a worldwide phenomenon in the early years ol photography. In Germany in 1839, lor example, the 
Leip2iger Staatanzeigernaa qualihed the very idea ol the photographic reproduction ol the human image as blasphemy, 
insisting, "Man is created in the image ol God and God's image cannot be captured by any human machine." This, 
the Leipzig publication maintained, had been proven "by a thorough German investigation." In addition, 
stock European accounts ol superstitious responses to photography in Airica, narrated in nearly the same words 
whether they describe the Khedive oi Egypt or the Mulena Mukwae oi the Lozi oi south-central Airica, cannot be 
relied upon to provide us with a iaithiul representation oi Alrican attitudes toward the photograph. Wherever open 
hostility developed toward the camera, it almost always arose in response to the invasive tactics oi its European 
operators rather than irom a peculiar Alrican inability to understand or accept the medium. In our own times, such 
was the reaction among the Nuba lollowing Nazi propagandist Leni Rielenstahl's staged documentaries in their 
area in the 1 970s. 

Monti does, however, point to a more relevant and crucial political and cultural impediment to the development 



232 



on 



and recognition of African photography in the nineteenth century. Writing about the photographic doc umentati 
of European colonies in Africa, lie notes in Africa Then: Photographs, 1840-1Q18 that "the authorities wh 
commissioned and financed a good part of the lirst photographic campaigns were, it seems, aware "I the risk o\ 
'natives' getting possession of this means of expression and using it a? an Instrument ol subversion In show ing the 
true conditions of their people." It is noteworthy that, even in the lace ol opposition and active discouragement, 
Africans nevertheless took possession of the camera and photographic processes. Before the end ol the century, a 
good number, some of whose identities have come down to us, had established fairly successful and lucrative prac tices 
around the continent. Among them are N. Walwin I lolm, who established his studio in Arc ra in L 883 and would 
he admitted into the British Royal Photographic Society in 1897, before moving on to Lagos to establish a legal 
practice; George S. A. Da Costa, who began professional photography in Lagos in 1 8 C &gt;5; I". I\. C. Lutterodt, who 
established his practice in Accra in 1889 but eventually traveled and worked all over Central Africa during the 
1 890s; and a handful of photographers active in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Addis Ababa, among other c ities, 
at the turn of the century. 

By the early twentieth century, photography was a profession highly regarded throughout Africa and studios run 
by professionals, many of whom were quite familiar with developments and techniques in Europe, were in operation 
in most cities. The case of Da Costa, a highly successful administrator and salesman who gave up his position to 
study photography and establish a studio, is revealing. Described by Allister Macmillan in 1 920 as "the ablest and 
best-known professional photographer in Nigeria," Da Costa had been manager of the ^ hurch Missionary Soc let) 
Bookshop in Lagos between 1877 and 1895, until he resigned and took up photography, spending quite a sizeable 
sum on training and eventually becoming a photographer of remarkable achievement. Not only did the colonial 
government entrust him with the task of photographically recording the construction oi the Nigeria Railways, work 
for which he was equally acknowledged in London, in 1920 Macmillan hired Da Costa to work on The Red Book 
of West Africa, which occasionally, especially in northern Nigeria, required battling the hostile elements. It would 
be in order to point out that Da Costa's work represents his times quite remarkably in it&gt; variance from the 
conceptions feeding and shaping the popular imagination outside the continent. Rather than conjuring a societ) 
of "cannibals" and "heathens," Da Costa's photographs of early twentieth-century A I ric a lead us to a cosmopolitanism 
steeped in awareness of other cultures, a world of burgeoning elite and savvy literati, a societ) ol international 
merchants, highflying attorneys, widely traveled politicians, newspaper tycoons, and society ladies, the same images 
we find in contemporary portrait painting of the period. Quite remarkably, also, photography, through the work ol 
Da Costa and others and with its head start on portrait painting in Lagos, where the earliest significant work in 
that genre dates to 1906, avoided the reputation that it came into in Europe as spoiling antagonist and was 
considered particularly acceptable. 

In Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Lisk-Carew brothers set up a popular practice to cater to the need- ol both local 
and visiting clients. Of their business Macmillan w rote in 1920: "There is probably DO establishment in I ivctou n 



233 



that is visited by more passengers from the steamers than that or Messres Lisk-Carew Bros. The reason of its 
popularity is because or its extensive stock or postcard views or Freetown and Sierra Leone." In Accra in 1919, 
|. A. C. Holm took over the studio or his rather, N. Walwin Holm, who had become an attorney in Lagos. The 
younger Holm, who had joined his lather's photographic studio in 1906 at the age or eighteen, is described by 
Macmillan as "an exponent or photography in all its branches." Holm produced several images or Accra and its elite 
for The Red Book of West Africa. In addition to Holm's studio, a number of smaller shops applied themselves to the 
demands of the growing population of urban elite. Photography was a lucrative business, and the photographer 
enjoyed a unique sense of place within the community, having access to the people, enjoying their confidence, and 
understanding their peculiar needs and demands with respect to the medium. The African photographer was thus 
better positioned than the foreigner within specific cultural frameworks that made his services accessible and 
affordable. With their privileged knowledge and location, as well as their ingenuity, photographers were able to 
devise novel uses for the medium and to introduce it within their communities and social circles. 

By the early twentieth century, African photographers enjoyed the trust and acceptance of not only their 
communities but of expatriates. The advent of journalism and newspaper publishing at the turn of the century, and 
the growth of this industry as part of the nascent anticolonial struggle in the 1930s, gave African photographers 
the opportunity to expand their practices and to gain greater exposure and respectability. Government yearbooks 
and other projects employed the services of photographers; colonial functions and royal visits provided commissions. 
Whereas a publication like the Amharic weekly Aimero in Abyssinia relied heavily on the work of Armenian 
photographers, others like Lagos Weekly Record and West African Pilot relied on African photographers for their 
images. Among other publications using the work of African photographers for their photographic illustrations 
were London's West Africa Magazine and local trade journals like Nigerian Teacher. 

In the decades that followed, such talented photographers as Peter Obe in Nigeria, Mohammed Amin in Kenya, 
Peter Magubane in South Africa, and Seydou Keita in Mali would emerge. Obe, perhaps his country's greatest 
photographer, not only produced work for numerous African publications and clients, but also for foreign news 
and photographic agencies. With a decidedly aesthetic intent, Obe approached every photographic moment — 
regardless of its ultimate utility as private or documentary image — with the weight of his technical and visual 
sophistication. Amin earned the recognition and respect of clients in Kenya, as well as of the establishments in 
Europe who sought his work. Today, he oversees a vast archive of important work that he produced over several 
decades and that represents mastery in every genre of photography. Magubane and David Goldblatt are the finest 
and most significant South African photographers of their generation. In bringing that country and its people to 
the world, Magubane has enjoyed the reverence of the international photographic community. And so has Keita, 
who in the past decade has reemerged, like blues legend John Lee Hooker, as a visionary comparable to only a few 
others in the twentieth century. 

Just as the African condition in the late twentieth century is denned considerably by expatriation, so has the

cartography of its photography undergone metamorphosis and expansion. As cultural critics and historians are 
Beginning to learn, to look to the continent alone for its cultures, its art, music, and literatures, is to sidestep a 
significant manifestation or its present. Among the continent's most important contemporary photographers is 
Rotimi Fani-Kayode, who was also the most signihcant and influential British photographer oi his generation. In 
his trier lifetime, Fani-Kayode worked principally within the traditions or Yoruba photography and image-making 
while denning ror the 1980s the British gay aesthetic m photography. Perhaps no one else has exerted such a 
powerful force upon England's photography since his death in 1989 at the age of thirty-four. Unfortunately, after 
his death, a good body of Fani-Kayode's work was exposed to intervention and corruption by a partner whose 
understanding of the image and of the photographic medium was essentially closed to Fani-Kayode's depth and 
criticality of meaning. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, artists no longer restrict themselves to the photograph per se, and photography is once 
more defined not simply by the camera but within the broader frame of the photographic medium, just as it was in 
the days of the hand-tinted photograph, when the camera was only one element in a larger process of photographic 
image-making, and just as it always has been for Africans. Among the artists working with this new understanding 
are such notable African photographers as Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye, who has worked in Europe and North 
America, and Gordon Bleach, who teaches in Eastman s Rochester and has worked in his own country, Zimbabwe. 
Bamgboye — a descendant of the legendary Yoruba sculptor Bamgboye and a distant protege of both Fani-Kayode 
and the stage personality and photographer Geoffrey Holder, whose 1950s work presaged and may very well have 
influenced that of Robert Mapplethorpe decades later — brings a mastery and awareness of the entirety of diverse 
photographic mediums to his explorations of the exoticized body, thereby bringing into crisis and cutting off 
photography s century-and-a-half long exploitation of the African body. 

In addition to those named are the hundreds of thousands of professional photographers across Africa attending 
to the photographic demands of their localities, who, together with those above, provide us with material toward 
the formulation of a theory of African photography. Stephen Sprague observes, for instance, that "the large number 
of photographs available from individual Yorubas [sic] and from photographers' negative files form a vast visual 
data bank . . . [that] might be utilized in a number of ways." Although there are unanswered questions resulting 
from a lack of proper attributions and occasional dubiousness arising from the practice of often better-known 
Western photographers who are known to have scratched out attributions from photographs and appended their 
own imprints, it is the period from the turn of the century into the early twentieth century that establishes for us 
the earliest body of verifiable African work in photography. We are able, nevertheless, to gain considerable insight 
into the general perception and application of the photographic medium by Africans before and after that time. 
And in these we find logical parallels to the West, as Sprague equally points out about Yoruba photography, and 
even more interesting peculiarities, which define a different understanding framed by a divergent philosophical 
perspective on the questions that have hitherto occupied the discourses of photography.

Photography and Its Discourses 

Since its birth, photography has generated innumerable quc-tions a nd contentions, all deriving from an inclination, 
which, incidentally, is peculiar to the West, to view the photographic process as different and separable from the 
larger body of techniques and processes 01 image-making. Yet it i&gt; difficult, even I utile, to a-, rite to photography 
any uniqueness beyond its facility to replicate and miniaturize, and thus make the &amp;xed image portable and readily 
available. In cultures where the multiple was already a long-standing artistic tradition in place to meet the demands 
of the community, and portability was the norm rather than the exception, even I li i - quality ol repeatabilitj was 
only convenient rather than unique. 

Much has been made in the history and criticism of photography, too, about its fidelity, or [a&lt; R thereof, to reality. 
On this, contemporary theorists id the medium remain as divided as its earliest commentators were, lor the 
intellectual and ruling circles of late- Enlightenment Europe, photography pro I Eered a mathematical exactitude ol 
reality, a reducible, calculable mechanism lor the scientific reproduction ol nature. In the essaj "Fixing the Face," 
Tristam Powell quotes the Victorian Lady Elizabeth Eastlake as remarking: "What are nine tenth- ol these facial 
maps, called photographic portraits, but accurate landmarks and measurements lor loving eyes and memories to 
deck with beauty and animate with expression, in perfect certainty that the ground plan is founded upon tac t." Lady 
Eastlake's comment bears an element of a certain naive faith in the fidelity 01 the photograph that would pervade 
not only the mind-set of the aristocracy in the West but particularly, and with greater danger and more insidious 
consequences, the various institutions of science and the state. v. onlident id this supposed fidelity and transparenc \. 
whole disciplines came to rely upon the evidential potentials or the photograph. Sociology appealed to it torconc rete 
statistical purposes, anthropology tor indubitable evidence ol the evolutionary order ol the human species, and in 
extension, as justification tor its mission of salvage exploration outside Europe, jurisprudence and other apparatuses 
of state control invented new systems of criminal cartography based on the consciously exaggerated laithiulness ol 
photographic likeness, and the fundamental right to contest institutional truth was curbed by the supposed 
impeachability of the new tool. 

Behind this rather essentialist and fundamentally flawed view of photography lay the myth ol automatism, the 
conviction that photography, unlike all the other techniques ol representation, hail become, through it.- supposed 
substitution of the machine for the human hand, the sign of the absence ol subjectivity and fallibility ol human 
agency. Writing over a hundred years after Lady Eastlake, in 1971, the philosopher Stanley v. avell replicates this 
view with a deeper and more disturbing clinicality in I he World \ iewed: Reflections on the (. Ontology oj Film: 
So far as photography satisfied a wish, it satisfied a wish not confined io painters, hut a human wish, intensifying since the 
Reformation, to escape subjectivity and metaphysical isolation — 17 wish for the power to reach this world, having for so long 
tried, at last hopelessly, to manifest fidelity to another. . . . Photography overcame subjectivity in a way undreamedof by 
painting, one which does not so much defeat the act of painting as escape it altogether: by automatism, by removing the 
human agent from the act of reproduction. 



237 



Similarly, in his 1 9 74 essay "On the Nature or Photography," Rudolf Arnheim writes of "the fundamental peculiarity 
of the photographic medium; the physical ohjects themselves print their image hy means of the optical and chemical 
action of light," thus lending further philosophical authority to the concept of a mechanical, objective process 
devoid of the compromise or choices of human intervention. 

Like Arnheim and others who have propagated this idea, Lavell builds his assertions on a number of fallacies, 
among which is the assumption that the human inclination is to escape subjectivity, every indication being, on the 
contrary, that the proclivity of the human species is to seek what is beyond, and to challenge the veracity of that 
which professes, objectivity. The second major fallacy underlining La veil's position, and which Arnheim uses as 
the fundamental principle in his argument, is the assertion that photography removes the human agency in the 
reproductive process. Rather than the sign of subjective or human absence in representation, photography on the 
contrary, though mechanical, is first and foremost a human invention entirely dependent on human manipulation, 
from its beginning in the conception and manufacture of the camera and its peripherals, to its primary conclusion 
of the photographic process in the image. 

The myth of the triumph of reason in the Enlightenment, upon which Cavell rests his assumption of the human 
desire for objectivity, survives on the denial of the very limited reach of the rationalist ideal and on a propensity 
to overlook the fact that at no time in the history of the Enlightenment, from its outset to its demise in the age of 
High Modernism (at the very tail end of which Cavell writes in 1971), was there a popular submission to the 
preeminence of the rational. Instead, the focus of the human will was in the opposite direction, toward a recognition 
and acceptance of the undesirability and impossibility of the objective. Thus, when Lady Eastlake speaks of the 
photographic image, she speaks of it not as an objective reproduction of reality but as an evocation, as a cartograph 
or map whose acceptance rests upon the knowledge that its "ground plan is founded upon fact." And even when 
John Ruskin speaks of the photographic image as a "portable" reality, he speaks not of an objective reproduction of 
reality or what Arnheim describes as "the manifest presence of authentic physical reality" but of a miniaturization, 
in other words a new reality that differs quite essentially from that which it evokes, if only by virtue of its portability. 
In essence, the only phenomenological invariable of photography is the materiality of the photograph, the creation 
of a new reality, a new, independent, and concrete object on and in the form of paper, glass, or any of the other 
innumerable surfaces upon which the photographic image can be placed. 

More recent, and perhaps even more intriguing, is the contention that the history and appeal of the photographic 
medium lies principally in the uniqueness of its process. Following the argument for mechanicality, Andre Bazin 
writes in What is Cinema: "The essential factor in the transition from the baroque to photography is not the perfecting 
of a physical process . . . rather does it lie in a psychological fact, to wit, in completely satisfying our appetite for 
illusion by a mechanical reproduction in the making of which man plays no part. The solution is not to be found 
in the result achieved, but in the way of achieving it." In their 1975 essay "Photography, Vision and Representation, 
J. Snyder and N. Allen note that "the use of a machine to lay down lines and the reliance on the natural laws of 



238 



retraction and chemical change to create pictures are viewed as the dec isive dirterenc es" between photography and 
other processes or picture-making. Yet these positions are indeed historically inaccurate because they fail to 
acknowledge the origins of the photographic process in the desire &lt;&gt;l its early practitioners, whether the scene painter 
Daguerre or the scientist and amateur landscapist William I [enry Fox lalhot, to achieve better results, images either 
more personally or commercially viable. It is noteworthy that lalhot had named bis invention the calotype, from 
the Greek kalos (beautiful sketch), and when falhot's process was introduced to the Friday evening meeting ol the 
Royal Institution in London on January 25, 1839, the inventor Michael Faraday had aptly described it a- the "Art 
of Photogenic Drawing, not failing to locate the emphasis on the product, the draw ing. From the camera ohecura 
to the camera luciaa, the drive for further inventiveness remained in the artist's frustration with the fleeting image 
and the wish to capture and preserve the form produced by those reproductive contraption-. 

A second observation to the contrary is that general interest in the photographic process — as distinct from the 
minority sect or intellectuals and philosophers and the handful of practitioners who over the years haw sought to 
position themselves apart from the greater photographic community through uncertain professional claim- and 
guises — always was and still remains in the result, the end product. T he desire to take control 01 the procc - 
driven, quite indubitably, by this interest in the product and its use. At no time, not even in the much-hyped era 01 
modernist autonomism, did the vocation of image-making rest on a preoccupation with the nature and relevance 
of processes in and of themselves; rather it was based on the nature and value of the image. I he erncac) and 
convenience of the photographic process, even the magicality associated with it in its early history, are subordinate 
to the true human appetite and fascination for the production of form, and the opportunity that photography 
provides for participation in the making of images. When a columnist wrote in Scientific America)} in 1 862 that 
photography contributes to human happiness a "thousand fold more," it had less to do with a fascination tor Light, 
science, and chemicals than with a human desire to make and acquire images. In discussing photography in Africa, 
it should he of interest to look at the foregoing contentions in the context of the continent and its traditions id 
making and consuming images. 

The Substance of the Image 

One of the most naturalistic traditions of image-making in Africa, besides the royal portraiture oi ancient [re, is 
that of thea^o funereal effigy (see p. 242) among the Owo ol western Nigeria, a tradition that, as Rowland Ahiodun 
observes in Yoruba: Nine Centuries of African Art and Thought, may date from before the sixteenth century. Not long 
after the death of an important person, an event is held at which a lire-size effigy ol the deceased is attired in his 
or her clothing and then either interred or allocated to a shrine commemorating the dead. 1 here is an insistence 
on verisimilitude in the portrayal ol the dead, and this demand lor faithfulness in the likeness, it has equally Keen 
pointed out, has its origins in antiquity. 
The earliest Western scholars addressing this memorial observance did not tail to dwell on the element ol 



239 



verisimilar representation, which seemed unusual within a culture oi greatly stylized sculpture, and in the light of 

its other known traditions that refrain from replicating likeness. Yet, Ahiodun rightly cautions: 

The effigy with its ako naturalism should not he judged for its photographic realism, hut for its efficacy within the context of 

the ako ceremony, which is . . . to make the end of this life, and the beginning of the next one, honorable and dignifying for 

one's parents, whose goodwill is needed by those still on earth. 

For this reason, the eyes of the effigies are always wide open, quite remarkably so, because the deceased to which 

they refer must keep awake on the other side, watchful over the living, as Abiodun observes. To represent them 

otherwise is to ignore a crucial element of the supplicatory act and to run a risk. 

Despite its verisimilitude, ako is not portraiture as we know it. At its very extremes, portraiture in the Western 
tradition may venture beyond accuracy into the fictive territories of distortion and hyperbole but never into 
invocation. Depending on its medium, the portrait may veer between what we have come to describe, rather unwisely, 
as "photographic" realism and the borders of acceptable flattery. Yet it remains a recollection, the transfixion or 
invocation of a precedent moment. Its phenomenological claims rest on its referentiality and finiteness. Even in 
its wildest departures from the frames of the verisimilar, as in those nineteenth-century Western photographic 
portraits that incorporate various signs of historical or religious association in order to imbue the middle-class 
sitters with the hitherto aristocratic attributes of grace, wealth, enlightenment, and soulfulness, portraiture as we 
know it remains ensconced by its nature as a play on memory. In ako, however, we find a different kind of portraiture: 
representation as anticipation. The verisimilitude we are introduced to is a mediated gesture between faithfulness 
and faith, between reflection and projection; it is a configuration of representation as both reflection and invocation 
beyond the limitations of transparency. For that which projects, that which anticipates and conjures, though faithful 
it may yet be to appearance, cannot be transparent since to be transparent is to convey that which already exists, 
that which precedes rather than supersedes the agency of its representation: to remain, as it were, within the reaches 
of death. The essence of verisimilitude here is not transparency but efficacy, the fulfillment of an intent beyond 
the materiality of the image. 

This understanding fits within a broader aesthetic of essence whereby the image is true as long as it efficaciously 
meets the specifications of its particular application within an intricate matrix of cultural expectations. Whereas 
the conventional qualification of such circumstance would be that the image is successful, that is to say that it 
fulfills its purpose, if success also equates truth within this aesthetic, this success is not restricted to the registration 
or excavation of the phenomenological contours of the subject through iconographic or iconological appendage. It 
does indeed extend the phenomenological to include the nonmimetic. Thus an image, be it photographic or 
otherwise, though it may not in verity refer to a subject, may yet be applied to the representation of that subject as 
long as it sufficiently encapsulates the perceived or intended attributes of that subject. A good example of this is 
found in another Yoruba ritual, that of gelede, in which matriarchal images are produced to reflect youth in order 
to flatter the elderly; flattery as a lobbying strategy is the essence of gelede. Although the image may refer to or be 



240 



directed at an individual, il nevertheless behooves the image-maker to take the liberty to supersede the transparent, 
thereby redefining faithfulness and introducing the essential gesture. And where necessary, the image-maker may 
depart entirely from the physically referential or, in other words, employ &lt;\n image other than thai .'I the target ol 
ritual flattery as long as it is still perceived to embody the spiritual essence o! that target. Thus, whereas in Western 
portraiture the search for inner truth in a subject may extend to distortion and mediation ol the verisimilar, but 
never so far as to depart entirely from the confines ol physically cognitive referent e, within the aesthetic governing 
gelede and Yoruba representation in general, it is precisely such departure thai may be the gesture necessar) tor 
successful imaging. The uniqueness oiako within this aesthetic, however, lier- in the tact lliat this liberty is c ontained 
by the need to produce images that the deceased subjects can recognize and identify with themselves. This 
requirement in itself constitutes a different gesture, what we might refer to as a gesture ol semblance. 

Ako introduces us to a philosophy of the image that invalidates the contest over transparency in the discourse ol 
image-making, one that must he central to our understanding of photography in A.frica. [he tradition o! funereal 
effigies is not restricted to the Owo and may indeed he found all over Alrica, and it is within this tradition ol the 
gesture of semblance that we find one of the earliest applications of photography by Alii cans. In Ethiopia, as soon 
as a rapport with the camera was reestablished and photography was popularized in the nineteenth century, the 
medium was incorporated into funereal rites. Upon a death, a photograph taken ol the deceased while alive would 
be retrieved, often replicated, and then borne in the funeral procession, ^ilino Guebre Sellassie's remarkable 
Chronique au regne ae Menelik II rois des rois d'Ethiopia, published in France in 1 9 30- 3 1 , Richard Panhhursl notes 
in his essay "The Political Image: The Impact of the Camera in an Ancient Independent Axrican Mate": 
It had been customary in funeral processions since time immemorial for mourners to display an effigy of the decease J. together 
with his horse ana other valuable property- With the advent oj the camera such articles tended to be supplemented' — ana the 
effigy even replaced — by photographic portraits of the departed which mourners held high above their heads, while they nailed. 
ritualistically, and perhaps recounted episodes of the deceaseds life and achievement. 

A notable occasion when this new prop of the mourning ritual was used was the funeral in 1QO0 of the governor of I larar 
and cousin of Emperor Menelik, Ras Makonnen, who was also father of the future and last monarch of Ethiopia, l\as I atari. 
Though the practice was observed within the aristocracy in the beginning, as the greater population had access to photography, 
it became part, also, of the popular culture of mourning. Such application of photography was particularly evident during the 
dictatorship of the Dhegue in the 1070s and lQ80s under I lai/e Mariam when the government presided over a decadt 
war and mass extermination similar to the decade of the missing in Latin America. Families carried the portraits of then- 
missing and dead in processions and wailing rituals, and often to the sites of excavations of mass graves where the photograph 
was not a mere effigy of the dead hut a/so a totem of damnation. 

Yet this practice had less to do with any greater faith in the accuracy ol the photographic image, or an interest in 
the photographic process, than with a recognition ol the mediums convenient delivery ol an image. It is worthy ol 
note that the photographic image was named se'el-fotograf in Amharic: a term that translates exac tly as "photographic

image," but also reminds us ol Faraday's "photogenic dra\n ing," for the word se'el alone can be applied to a draw ing, 
painting, design, or photograph. I lie painter Wossene Kosrof, an Amharic speaker, indeed confirms this use. 
Although within the realms of state politics in Ethiopia, the e\ identiary capabilities ol the photograph would be 
called into service time and again, as already mentioned, leading first to the Kill ol the prince and heir-apparent 
Lij Iyasu in 1916, and later to the forced abdication ol I taile Selassie in 1^74, the broadet understanding and 
application ol photography was and remain.- referential and evocative, [yasu was deposed in I 91 () on the supposed 
strength of photographic evidence, a mysterious photograph having Keen furnished in support o\ the accusation 
that lie had Muslim sentiments and was therelore unlit to be a Christian monarch. I [owever, several sources point 
to a popular conviction among the people that the implicative photograph was a forgery produced In an Armenian 
photographer in Addis Ababa at the behest of foreign intelligence operatives intent on the iall ol the young prince, 
thus signing not only the possibility of such discrepancy, but, even more importantly, a lingering Ethiopian distrust 
or the supposed indubitability ol the photographic image. 

Another Yoruba practice provides further insight into the general African position on the question ol the 
transparency or the photographic image. Among the Yoruba ol the old Oyo empire, the cult ol twins is a prevalent 
practice that, according to records, certainly dates back to earlier than the nineteenth century. For unique dietar) 
reasons, the Yoruba have the highest rates or twin births in the world, and in earlier times the fragility .'I twins led 
to high infant mortality. For deceased twins, therelore, a practice was begun that the explorer Richard Lander 
described in 1826 as one ol "affectionate memorials." Made in honor ol the dead, ere ripe/7, or twin images, are 
nevertheless tended and nurtured by the living as if they were the children they commemorate. Originally, these 
images were created in wood, by a sculptor whom the priest appointed, and upon production sacralized. A twin 
mother would carry the sculpture with her in the same manner as she would a living child, and in some known 
instances, families passed down their twin images from generation to generation, several decade- after thee nildren - 
death. In recent times, commercially produced plastic dolls have been sacralized and put to this use, as [ohn Picton 
has observed, a practice that in itself constitutes an important redefinition ol the memorial image. 

Even more relevant to our purposes is the employment or photography in the place ol sculpture. It is not clear at 
wdiat point in history the Yoruba began to use photographs as ere ibeji, hut indications are that the prac tice may well 
date bach to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. A photographic image ol the dead twin is used in the 
same manner as a wood sculpture: kept in the altar to the twins and brought out Eor rituals. \\ hen no images oi the 
twins exist, a family may have a sculpture made, and then commission a photograph ol the s&lt; ulpture fort onvenienc e 
and better display in the home. But when the photograph ol the human is available, no use or referent e is made to 
the traditional wood sculpture. In his essay "Yoruba Photography: How the Yoruba See themselves ol l l, &lt;.&gt;. 
Sprague observes: 

Photographs are often made of twins ami other children to hang in the par/or with the photographs of other family members. 
Then, if a child dies, there is a portrait by which to remember him. The procedure becomes more complex when one twin dies

top: "In this example the surviving girl twin was photographed once as herself in her own clothes, and once as her dead twin brother in matching boy's clothes. The 

photographer, Simple Photo, made a 'full plate' enlargement for me in the same way that he would for a client. He mounted the finished enlargement in the usual manner on 

a 10" x 12" cardboard mount with a printed border." From Stephen F. Sprague, "Yoruba Photography: How the Yoruba See Themselves," p. 56

"This little girl, Taiwo, holds a multiple-printed hand-colored photograph representing herself and her dead twin sister sitting together. It is actually the same image of 
Taiwo printed twice. The photograph is used by her mother in place of the traditional ibeji (twin sculpture)." From Stephen F. Sprague, "Yoruba Photography: How the 

Yoruba See Themselves," p. 56 



245 



before their photograph is taken. If the twins were of the same sex, the surviving twin is photographed alone, and 
the photographer prints this single negative twice, so that the twins appear to he sitting side by side in the final photograph 
[see p. 245]. If the twins were of opposite sexes, the surviving twin is photographed once in male clothing and once in female 
clothing. Sometimes these two exposures are made on separate negatives, which must then be printed together. . . . The 
photographer attempts to conceal the line blending the two separate exposures in order to maintain the illusion of twins sitting 
together m a single photograph. 

And yet greater complication occurs when more than two children are involved. In what Sprague considers an 
unusual case involving triplets (see p. 244, bottom), "the two brothers died, and the surviving girl was photographed 
once as herself in girl's clothes and once in matching hoy's clothes. . . . The photographer then printed the 'boy' 
image twice, once on either side or the girl, to give the proper illusion or triplets." The result, which is not perceived 
as a trick but rather as a normal responsibility or the image-maker, is the most beautifully conceived photograph 
possible, and the most significant comment on the substance or the photographic image. 

As can be seen from these and other examples, the Yoruba associate photography not with objectivity but with 
the possibility and necessity or illusion, which is contrary to the mainstream, Western articulation or the 
photographic medium. In the example or the cult or twins, the camera is first subordinated to the art or the sculptor, 
through the use or photographic images or ritual sculpture and in an interesting coalescence or fascination and 
disregard, and then brought into service as an extension or the image-maker's tools. The fundamental requisite for 
the application as well as the effectiveness of the photographic medium in this tradition is the redefinition of 
objectivity — from the canonical objective to the photographic objective — and the supremacy of faith over 
faithfulness. By overlaying the right apparel, the photographic image of the living twin becomes that of the dead. 
(The reverse, using the image of a person taken either in the course of life or right before death to stand posthumously 
for the deceased, would be acceptable in the West and, in fact, has made numerous appearances over photographic 
history.) And much as it may be argued that the image remains indeed that of the living twin, the figure before the 
camera, the image in question is not the figure before the lens but that which emerges after the photographic moment. 
The obvious intent is not to concede transparency to the photographic image but to recognize and underline, instead, 
its nature as chimera. 

In the 1980s, Fani-Kayode extended this tradition of essential subjectivism by applying photography to the 
imaging of Yoruba deities and principles connected with the cult of abiku, the changeling fated to repeat death and 
rebirth, and especially of the most engaging yet singularly photogenic Yoruba deity, Eshu, the divinity of ambiguity 
and fate. While the representation of deities may be restricted to the mimetic translation of myth — the integration 
of convoluted iconic and philosophical principles into a pantheistic visual representation, in other words the 
generation of the iconic — it demands fluid manipulation of an artistic medium even within the frames of its canon. 
Few African divinities lend themselves to easy translation, and the employment of the photographic in the 
interpretation of the metaphysical rests on the premise that the medium possesses the flexibility to extend itself 



246 



beyond mimesis and sufficiently lends itsell riot only bo tke skill and will of tke image-maker hut also bo tke di&lt; kates 
of the patron and an intricate cultural mat rix. In his re-creations &lt;»l Esku, Fani-Kayode captured tke pkysical and 
conceptual essence 01 the trickster god: misckievousness, amkiguity, multisexuality, indeterminacy, perpetual 
mobility, and unpredictability, attributes that defy tke confines &lt;&gt;l tke mimetic trail and yield onl) to Bukjective 
intervention. Tke grin/grimace comes Eortk most unnervingly on tke face ol tke potentiallj wicked divinity, who 
deliberately sets friend against friend, violates U\- her sliding belore llieir own motker's eyes, defies all predic tions, 
and, most importantly, signifies the futility 01 aksolutes, including tke fiction ol transparencj or visual trutk. 

For the Yoruba, therefore, tke camera is not a detached meckanical contraption superseding kuman agency, as 
Cavell thought; nor is pkotograpky tke peculiar process in whick "tke okjec t- tkemselves print tkeir image b) means 
or the optical and chemical action ol light, as Arnheim ludicrously said. Instead, pkotograpk) offers tke unique 
ease of combining possibilities of fidelity not readily available to tke kuman agent with tkose of manipulakility 
requisite to tke fulfillment ol tke essence ol tke image. Early in tkeir acquaintance with pkotograpky, tke people 
recognized the indispensability of human agency in the pbotograpkic process. And in tkeir use ol pkotograpky, its 
practitioners emphasized tke affinity between the medium and oilier processes. \ close look at cue Ol tke twin 
pkotograpks Sprague kas called to our attention (see p. 244, top) reveals tke pkotograpker's manipulation ol tke 
figure s proportions so that, though of the same lieu re, the image ol the female twin is smaller than that ol tke male. 
I trough this simple yet highly ingenious technique, gender attributes and dissimilarities are codified, and tke living 
twin's femininity is emphasized. In a second photograph, that ol the triplets referred to above (see p. 244, bottom), 
a different, even more sophisticated technique is employed. By a subtle change in the placement ol the knees in the 
seated figure's pose, the female image is made to look shorter than the male. I 1 1 1 1 ~, her brothers, for whom the 
woman serves as photographic surrogate, appear bigger and taller in the hnal print. 1 I ere we certainly hnd no e\ idence 
of a mythical "human wish to escape subjectivity ... by automatism, by removing tke human a cent from the act ol 
reproduction." I here are no indications, either, of any concern tor what Snyder and Allen describe as the use oi 
a machine to lay down lines and the reliance on the natural laws ol retraction and chemical change to c re.it e pictures 
(a concept that, in any case, means absolutely nothing to either the average American or Yoruba ma her and consumer 
of the photographic image). Instead, human agency is assumed as an essential element ol all image-making, including 
the photographic. Photography is regarded and employed in the same manner as sculpture, or as painting and 
drawing — as the Ethiopians indicate in their choice ol the word sec/ — as yet another process ol image-making, a 
process of »niL:i&gt;iLi rather than taking. 

This understanding of photography as indistinguishable from the other image-making pro, esses, and in particular 
as manipulakle rather than clinical, is lurther manifest in a fundamental distrust oi the photographic medium 
a 1110110 the Yoruha and in other African cultures, an attitude we migkt kest describe as one ol requisite ambivalence. 
As Sprague illustrates in kis essay, tke camera's record is considered inadequate in itsell unless it fits into a frame 
of canonical specifications of representation that governs all image-making without exception. In portraiture, 



247 



including that or twins, for instance, the image in prohle is considered inaccurate since it on the one hand fails to 
register the totality or countenance and therefore or individual character and being, and on the other introduces 
an element or distrustfulness or timidity into the personality. Thus, the camera in and or itself is incapable or 
articulating the contours or accuracy, and the responsibility to direct this supposedly truthful and objective 
instrument toward truth ultimately rests on its human operator, the real image-maker. 

We return then to the question of the significance of process in relation to the image. Again it is useful to recall, 
if only to dismiss, Bazin's insistence in What is Cinema that "the essential factor in the transition from the baroque 
to photography is not the perfecting of a physical process . . . rather does it lie in a psychological fact, to wit, in 
completely satisfying our appetite for illusion by a mechanical reproduction in the making of which man plays no 
part. The solution is not to be found in the result achieved, but in the way of achieving it." Chinua Achebe makes 
a seemingly parallel observation when he writes in "The Igbo World and Its Art" of "the Igbo aesthetic value as 
process rather than product." But there ends the analogy, for process in Achebe's reading of the Igbo aesthetic 
specifically implies the act as distinct from the means of making, since both are often of equal significance in the 
bid for efficacy. Whereas Bazin's theory rests on a precisionist equation of scientific agency, that is, the assumption 
that the application of a specific body or level of instrumentation yields a calculable result with minimal human 
input, the aesthetic articulated by Achebe places its accent on the details of human facture, on making rather than 
registering. Yet, much as the act is an essential element of the image-making process in Africa, the product (the 
image) and its efficacy (its ability to satisfy demands largely unrelated to mechanical specifications) are what 
ultimately count, buch is the condition of the image. And we could argue that this is essentially the case with 
photographs used in the veneration of twins or the Amharic funeral procession, or Magubane's photographs of 
mines, or indeed Fani-Kayode's images of the deity of ambivalence. A preoccupation with the mechanical intricacies 
of the darkroom or the details of physics, chemistry, and light have no place in the process and purpose of image- 
making beyond their assistance in striving for greater effectiveness. 

From the foregoing, we may attempt to articulate a theory of the photographic in which its essence resides not 
in the details and mechanics of reproduction but in the significatory possibilities of the emergent form: what 
we might call the substance of the image. Though this may suggest an essentialist functionalism, it is nevertheless 
in the image, rather than in the apparatus of its creation, that the relevance of the medium is situated. The fallibility 
of this image is taken for granted, as is its subordination to the dictates of human agency. This fallibility necessitates 
a frame of ambivalence, which, although often subsumed under the illusion of scientific verity in the West, governs 
the production and consumption of the photographic image in Africa. Whether used in the imaging of gods, 
in the rituals and logistics of mourning, or indeed in the recovery of the literal moment, photography is perceived 
as lacking in inherent integrity and thus open and available to the whims of power. Rather than the innocent 
registration of a literal configuration emptied of the extra-aesthetic, the photographic image is rightly understood 
as a domitable site whose frames must be guarded and contested. In the end, it is that which levels photography 



248 



with the rest of the image-making processes, namely its lack ol integrity, thai also undersc ores its signihc an&lt; e, its 

substance. 

The Location of Meaning 

It is within this framework that we can meaningfully approach two incidents mentioned earliet thai reveal an 
important aspect ol the photographic image in Alrica and bring us to a conclusion. I hese are Khedive Mehmet'e 
attempt to place himself behind the lens and talcc control 01 the photographic process snortlj after the arrival ol 
the daguerreotype in Egypt, and the reaction ol members ol tne Ethiopian court to bdoardo Ximenes's application 
of the camera in Abyssinia. Vernei 9 I rust rat ion, through the supply and use ol suspect photographic chemicals, ol 
the Khedive's effort, which earned himself access to the forbidden territories ol the monarch's women's quarters, 
signalled the beginning of the contest between the African and the outsider lor the photographic image. Mehnu-t 
realized that in bringing so manipulable a medium as photography to near upon the body id another, the presenc e 
behind the camera must be one with that other and must share, in a fundamental sense, a certain identity with the 
subject; if not, the photographic process becomes an act of trespass and violation. 

I n Africa Then, Monti recalls an incident of 1896 in which an Ethiopian nobleman protested the copious use ol 
the camera by Ximenes, noting rather ruefully that Ximenes had "too much 111 his camera already and wondering 
whether he wanted "to take away the whole country." Not only was X mi cues taking photographs in a period ol great 
political sensitivity and thus constituting an intelligence threat to Abyssinia, but, more importantly, his respondent 
was perhaps not unaware of the possibilities of the seamless, loose image. Roth Men met and the Ethiopian nobleman 
discerned the site of significance in the photographic process as the manipulable image. Both understood that the 
primary element in this process is not the mechanical but the human agent. And [ike the Ioruha and their 
photographers, both knew that the contest for meaning in photography must lie in the substance id the image.

Cornelius Yao Azaglo Augustt 



Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye 




Cornelius Yao Azaglo Augustt was born in 1924 
in Kpaleme, Togoland (now Togo). His family 
was of the Ewe ethnic group. When Augustt 
was eighteen years old, he bought his first 
camera, a Kodak, but he did not learn the 
technical aspects of photography until the early 
1950s, when he moved to Bobo-Dioulasso, a 
small city northwest of Ghana, in Upper Volta 
(now Burkina Faso). There, he learned from two 
local photographers about outdoor photography 
as well as studio and darkroom techniques. 

In 1955, he moved again, this time to 
Korhogo (Cote d'lvoire), where, in 1958, he 
opened his Studio du Nord. Later on, already 
known as a talented photographer, he was 
particularly in demand for his black-and-white 
portraits. Since the early 1980s, however, with 
the arrival of color photography in Cote d'lvoire 
and an influx of traveling photographers there, 
he has all but ceased his photographic activity.

Statement 

The photographs presented in this exhibition 
were taken by Augustt in 1964 in various 
villages in northern Cote d'lvoire, using a 
medium-format (6x6 cm) Rolleiflex camera 
equipped with a standard lens. The subjects 
posed in natural light before a very simple 
backdrop made from a cloth stretched between 
makeshift stakes. In a single day, Augustt 
might take dozens of portraits, in series, for 
use in I.D. cards. 

One should remember that starting in 1960 
(the date Cote d'lvoire gained independence) 
there was a great demand for photographs for 



national identity cards, which were required for 
participating in elections. Following the needs 
of his clientele, Augustt often left his studio in 
Korhogo and traveled into the surrounding 
villages populated by Senufo farmers, known 
for their passion for work and the harshness of 
their existence on barren lands. 

In accordance with the administrative 
requirements in effect at this time for this type 
of photograph, the subjects' faces are slightly 
turned to one side so as to show only one ear. 
The photographs show each person in full, but 
since only their faces were to appear in the 
final image, most subjects posed without any 
concern for how they were dressed or how they 
looked, presenting themselves to the lens as 
silent blocks. For most of them, this was their 
first contact with photography. 

In short, in almost all cases, these are 
portraits of men, a fact that reveals the 
secondary role played by women in rural areas 
in the political life of the country at that time.

Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye was born in 1963 in 
Odo-Eku, Nigeria, where he received his 
primary education. In 1976, he moved to 
Glasgow, Scotland, where he continued his 
schooling, graduated, and later became a 
specialist in chemical and process engineering. 
In the mid-1980s, Bamgboye took up 
photography. At the beginning of the 1990s, 
he moved to London, where he pursued his 
photographic activities and began to 
make films, videos, and photo-installations. 

Since 1987, he has exhibited his 
photographs and other works in solo and group 
exhibitions at galleries and alternative spaces 
in France, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, 
Australia, Nigeria, South Africa, and South 
Korea. He is the recipient of many grants and 
prizes, and his work has been featured in such 
contemporary-art publications as Artscribe, 
Flash Art, Nka: Journal of Contemporary African 
Art, and Parachute. Bamgboye's visit to Nigeria 
in 1995 initiated the new multimedia and 
culturally charged works that he has been 
producing in London since then.

Statement 

After I graduated from my formal training in 
engineering, what I felt most was a yearning for 
more control over my creativity and a need to 
work with issues of direct cultural and social 
relevance, considering in particular my cross- 
cultural experiences and inspirations that 
resulted from having been raised in both 
African and European cultures. From the 
outset, without any appreciable black culture or 
community in Scotland then, I developed a 
photographic practice initially focused on the 
nature of self and cultural identity. Through 
living and working abroad, most recently 
in London, I have had rich experiences within 
thriving black communities for the first time 
since I emigrated from Africa to Britain at an

early age. In 1993, I was offered a Gilbenkian 
Foundation grant to extend the ideas inherent 
to my photographic practice into the medium of 
filmmaking, and since that time film and video 
have become increasingly important working 
mediums for me. 

Both personal experience and a critical 
framework based broadly in the disciplines of 
anthropology, psychoanalysis, and cultural and 
postcolonialist theory continue to inform my 
current inquiries, which use the mediums of 
film, installation, photography, performance, 
and video art. With my mixed background in 
science and art, gaining a familiarity with 
technology has not been a daunting task, nor 
has understanding where the boundaries 
between art and technology collide and inform 
each other in contemporary terms. It is 
therefore logical that the increasing 
international influence of hypermedia (resulting 
from the convergence of text, image, sound, 
and video in electronic media) should also have 
an impact on the future nature and direction of 
my artistic practice. The concerns in this "new 
world order of art" are presently centered 
around issues of authorship and collaborations 
across platforms. The continuing Westernized 
perspective inherent within this new 
internationalism of art has significant impact 
on the artists in this show and, as a 
consequence, on non-Western art practices as 
a whole. It is these concerns that will be 
addressed in and challenged by my present 
and future works.

Born in 1963 to a family of Asian immigrants in 
Mbarara, Uganda. Zarina Bhimji studied fine 
arts at Goldsmiths' College in London 
(1983-86) and completed her postgraduate 
studies in mixed media at the Slade School of 
Fine Arts, receiving her M.F.A. in 1989. She 
has exhibited widely over the past decade, 
mainly in England, as well as in Germany. In 
addition, Bhimji has been an artist-in-residence 
at several colleges, museums, and alternative 
spaces in Great Britain, experiences that have 
frequently resulted in traveling exhibitions of 
her work. She is also an accomplished 
lecturer and is particularly interested in 
exploring and interacting with the environments 
and institutions in which she researches 
and exhibits her photo-installations. Her 
investigations into history, tradition, and 
language, as well as issues of representation, 
categorization, and control, emphasize her 
interest in the construction of culture and 
identity.

Statement 

The work I am undertaking for the Art in 
Hospitals project has come out of my 
experience working in the pathology museum at 
a London hospital. I am exploring my direct 
interest in the body in terms of vulnerability/ 
fear. The search for "truth" is not my strong 
point. 

There are four documentary-style 
photographs of dissected body parts. My 
responses to the pathology museum were grief, 
fear, and disempowerment. The four images 
are as follows: 

Specimens in glass cases on museum 



shelves Listen to the room 

Foot Indelible 

Eye We are cut from the same cloth 

Lung (blue tint) Monster 

There are four additional images, which are 
abstract still lifes. These four images are as 
follows: 

Chiffon &amp; orchids Listen to the room 

Black rubber &amp; tulips Indelible 

Red chiffon We are cut from the same cloth 

Blue/black hair Monster 

The four images of the first set are placed in 
areas that are not accessible to the public. 
These areas are ones devoted to learning, i.e., 
a lecture hall and its adjacent corridor. The four 
images of the second set are installed in a 
public area of the hospital. 

While I was working in the hospital. I was 
aware of mortality and the atmosphere of 
death. To take this further, the specimens in 
the pathology museum offered no voice. The 
titles of the two series correlate mourning as a 
strong emotion. There is a sense of 
"fragmentation, mutilation and destruction." 
"Fragments and dismemberment are at issue 
here." "It is representable only by a language 
of excess." "The coherence of the body is 
totally shattered." There are questions 
concerning "the objectivity of science, the cool 
clinical observation of the dissecting table' 
(quotations from Linda Nochlin, The Body in 
Pieces: The Fragment as a Metaphor of 
Modernity [London: Thames and Hudson, 
1994], pp. 9-19). 

The still lifes have come out of my being and 
working in the hospital. The questions of 
death/mortality are posed under a thin veil of 
eroticism. This is informed by the use of a 
sense of material, and the pleasure of food 
and smells. The use of textiles gives an 
understanding of material as well as a sense of 
clothing taking on the sentient qualities of skin. 
It is the cloth's implicit tactile and sensory 
qualities that often find their way into the 
surfaces of the photographs. Like human skin. 
cloth is a membrane that divides an interior 
from an exterior.

Gordon Bleach 




Born in 1953 in Mutare, Southern Rhodesia 
(now Zimbabwe), Gordon Bleach has had an 
impressive academic career, which has helped 
shape the highly technical processes and 
sophisticated imagery of his photographs. In 
the early 1970s, Bleach moved to South Africa. 
During the 1980s, he completed his M.A. and 
Ph.D. in applied mathematics at the University 
of Cape Town and started showing his 
photographs in Cape Town and Johannesburg 
galleries. 

In the mid-1980s, he relocated to the United 
States, where he taught at Rochester Institute 
of Technology, Rochester, New York, as an 
adjunct professor in mathematics (1986-91) 
and in information science and technology 
(1988-91). He also taught computer science 
at the State University of New York at 
Binghamton in 1992. Beginning in 1991, he 
studied photography at Rochester Institute of 
Technology (M.F.A., 1994) and then art history 
at the State University of New York at 
Binghamton (Ph.D., 1996). Currently, he is a 
visiting assistant professor in the history and 
theory of art at the College of Imaging Arts and 
Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology. He 
has also been exhibiting regularly in Rochester 
and has been lecturing extensively throughout 
the United States on art theory and African 
issues.

Statement 

The photographs on exhibition are from S CRYPT 
(1989-), an ongoing project that writes and 
stages the archive — "memory building" in a 
double sense. Initially located in the Rochester 



Institute of Technology's library during its major 
expansion (1989-91), S CRYPT addressed the 
procedures by which an archive and its material 
structure are fabricated. The images displayed 
here record small geographic and architectural 
pathologies (building walks, spurious artifacts) 
performed on the construction site. Long 
exposures of up to an hour were used 
to question the self-evident immediacy of 
photographic documentation. Since the 
aberrational structures were traced, built . . . 
dismantled, and returned during exposure, they 
are only partially legible in the final images. 
Furthermore, their archivist-builder appears 
blurred to the point of invisibility. Library 
construction eventually shuttered and 
entombed what remained of the scenes and 
their spray-painted inscriptions. The spurious 
artifacts are now dispersed across the 
official building, and the borrowed materials 
encrypted in their proper place. 

s CRYPT\s triangulated with two other 
projects. A photographic sequence of 
cartogenic landscapes (1982-86) alludes to 
the beauty and pathology of the South African 
landscape during the late apartheid years. The 
hybrid visual text taken from point G (1993-) 
draws from an art-historical investigation of 
cartographic and photographic archives from 
countries (Zimbabwe, South Africa, England, 
the United States) on three continents. Shared 
colonial fantasies as well as spatial-temporal 
dislocations are illuminated, and the unsettling 
effects on contemporary national identities are 
traced.

Nabil Boutros 



Cloete Breytenbach 




Born in 1954 in Cairo, Egypt, Nabil Boutros 
studied decorative arts while living in that 
country. In the 1970s, he moved to Paris 
(where he now lives) and focused his studies 
on fine arts, particularly painting. Boutros 
started his photographic career in 1979, but 
he has (until as recently as 1990) continued 
his work in decoration and design in the fields 
of theater, television, and advertising. From 
1983 to 1986, he exhibited his paintings in 
several galleries in Paris. Since 1988, he has 
participated in many solo and group 
photography exhibitions in France and Egypt 
and has completed a variety of commissioned 
photographic projects, on such subjects as the 
restoration of the Sphinx of Giza (1992) and 
the Temple of Akhmim (1993), and the 
spectacles organized at the Grande Halle de la 
Villette, Paris (1995).

Statement 

Born in Egypt, I have lived its rich complexity, 
its rhythm, and its light. 

Egyptian society never ceases to experience 
tensions and mutations due to its heritage and 
its ability to assimilate "modernity." Being 
conscious of this, my approach to the country 
is first and foremost a discovery of the people, 
as well as the places and objects surrounding 
them. For me, the photographic act is a kind of 
passport leading one toward others and not a 
permit to steal their images. 

A work protocol has become an imperative 
for me, like a kind of ethics: I have opted not 
for surprise effects with shock value, but for a 
kind of induction. I try to find the essential 
through, and in spite of, the cumbersome 
details of the photographic fact to show "this 



exorbitant thing that leads from the body to the 
soul" (Roland Barthes). 

This work strives toward a vision of the 
"inner" Egypt, whose face will only reveal itself 
if one shows great respect and understanding.

ten years as a contributor to various South 
African publications, including Drum magazine. 
In 1962. he immigrated to England and was 
hired as a staff photographer by London Daily 
Express, where he worked for five years before 
returning to South Africa in 1967. Breytenbach 
traveled throughout Europe and to other parts 
of the world during those five years, and he 
sold many of the photographs he took there to 
Time. Life. Pans Match. Bunte (a South African 
magazine), and other publications. 

In the work that he has done in Africa, where 
he covered various liberation and political 
struggles. Breytenbach has shown himself to 
be a photojournalist of great determination and 
resilience. In Angola, he photographed the long 
war of independence waged against the 
Portuguese from 1961 to 1975 and the 
sixteen-year civil war that broke out in 1975 
between the forces of the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, 
working right up to Angola's first elections in 
1994. He also covered conflicts in 
Mozambique. Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Central 
Africa, as well as the 1973 Yom Kippur War in

Salla Casset was born in 1910 in Saint-Louis, 
Senegal. He was working as a carpenter when 
his older brother (the celebrated Mama Casset) 
introduced him to photography. He perfected 
his technique by studying with French 
photographers Tenequin and Oscar Lataque, 
who worked in Dakar, the capital. He opened 
his first studio in Dakar on Blanchot Street, 
and later, in 1942, moved it to 13th Street in 
the Medina. As one of the first indigenous 
photographers in Senegal, Casset traveled 
throughout his homeland and neighboring 
countries in West Africa to take pictures. 
Casset's work was very popular in Dakar, 
especially during the 1940s and 1950s, and 
his photographs still decorate the living rooms 
of many homes there. He died in 1974.

Statement 

In Dakar, Senegal, "Salla Casset" is a famous 
stop on the "rapid" (interurban) bus line in the 
Medina. Salla Casset's popularity is tied to his 
work as a photographer, a profession for which 
he demonstrated great talent and passion. 
During his lifetime, he was greatly admired for 
his work, and his fame stretched beyond the 
borders of Senegal. He went all over Senegal 
and many other African countries to record 
images of historic events and political, 
religious, and traditional figures. '"Quality first, 
profit second,' was his motto. He demanded a 
lot from himself," says his oldest son, 
Abdoulaye Casset, who currently manages his 
father's studio with his brothers.

the Toure regime. In the camp's jails, Toure 
imprisoned and tortured thousands of his 
opponents and those merely suspected of so 
being. Some of them remained for more than 
twenty years; a great many others died in those 
cells. 

After Toure's death, Camp Boiro opened to 
the public for one day in April 1984. On this 
occasion, Diallo took a series of photographs 
of graffiti that prisoners had written on the 
walls.

Born in 1950 in Gongore, Mamou, Guinea, 
Mody Sory Diallo has served in his country's 
government in various capacities: assisting in 
the literacy campaign directed by the secretary 
of state, and working for the Ministry of 
Information and Ideology and for the Ministry of 
Administrative Reform. In 1984, when private 
initiatives were newly permitted after the 
overthrow of Guinea's dictatorship, Diallo 
embarked on a project to document important 
events in the recent history of his country. He 
began by photographing the infamous Camp 
Boiro, where opponents of the Marxist-Leninist 
regime of Sekou Toure had been detained and 
tortured. Currently, Diallo is committed to the 
creation of an independent agency in Guinea to 
collect and preserve the national patrimony of 
images relating to social, political, cultural, and 
economic concerns. Diallo has exhibited his 
works in the exhibition Premieres Rencontres 
de la photographie afhcaine. Bamako, Mali 
(1994) and in French institutions. The 
Photographers' Gallery, London presented a 
solo exhibition of his work in spring 1996.

Mohammed Dib was born in 1920 in Tlemcen, 
Algeria. Dib started painting when he was 
twelve years old, and a few years later he also 
began to write. He had several exhibitions of 
his paintings while still very young, but he 
gradually gave up painting in order to devote 
himself to the poems, novels, and short stories 
that he has been writing ever since. Dib 
discovered his interest in photography by 
chance: some time during the 1940s, a friend 
lent him a Rolleiflex camera. His photographs 
from 1946, after which his photographic 
activity ceased, have been shown in France and 
in Bamako. Mali. However. Dib has never seen 
any of the exhibitions in which his works have 
been shown and has never considered himself 
a photographer.

Statement 

The photograph captures a moment and fixes it 
for eternity. Herein lies its drama: it dries up 
time, which is the expression of life. It 
dessicates everything that is in flux, everything 
that ebbs and flows. Captured by the lens and 
thus stolen from time, this world — with its 
changing, fluctuating, uncertain course that is 
our own — becomes inaccessible, frozen in 
objectivity. The taking (appropriating) of a 
photograph casts it into the black hole of the 
immutable. ... A photograph can never re- 
create for me the image my memory preserves 
of a person or place. The image I see 
reproduced before me remains foreign to me;

there is no communication between us. This 
image mimicking an entity closed in upon itself 
does not exist. The image is autistic. However, 
if there is communication, it arises from a 
misunderstanding between what it is 
understood I should recognize and what is 
supposed to be taken for granted. In such 
cases, I play the unconscious and hypocritical 
role of someone who sees not what is, but 
what he projects onto what is. . . . 

Even if I am in it, a photograph attests to 
reality without me. But what kind of reality is 
this ectoplasmic reality, which gives one the 
ridiculous and disturbing impression of being 
inhabited by phantoms, which empties people 
and things of all life, freezing them for eternity? 

What looks back at me when I look at a 
photograph is the void envisaging itself, 
creating a face with which to face me. . . . 
A photograph does not show us the world: like 
a mirror, it only reproduces the way things look, 
creates but a virtual sphere of reflections 
around man. . . . 

In posing before the lens, we expose 
ourselves. To what? Who can say? To the void. 
To something like the vision of our own death. 
We look at the impression our portrait gives 
once taken: even if the eyes are closed, shut 
tight, the gaze they mask always filters 
through, continuing to look at us. Moreover, 
there is no difference between a photograph of 
us taken when we are alive or after we are 
dead. Photographs taken in a morgue prove 
this point, even while bearing witness to a 
state beyond which we cannot go. . . . And in 
this way the photograph reveals its true nature 
as fetish. What is a fetish? It is an object that, 
with its specific properties, acquires the ability 
to enter into contact with a universe of occult 
powers and death, of which it becomes the 
material stand-in. . . . Photography awakens 
the fetishistic instinct in man. . . . One has only 
to think of the care and the respect with which 
we handle our photographs; or the use some of 
us put them to in either black magic or white; 
or the current trend of placing photographs 
over graves, as if they will watch over the 
deceased loved one in the next life and also 
serve as a means with which to communicate 
with him or her. 

The shameless, sacrilegious voyeur sleeping 
inside man could never forgo the image.

Born in 1951 in Tunis, Tunisia, Kamel Dridi 
studied law in Paris in the beginning of the 
1970s. By the end of the decade, he was 
devoting most of his time to photo-reportage 
for different French magazines and 
newspapers. During the 1980s, he completed 
various photographic series including a group 
of portraits of foreign artists and writers living 
in Paris, and several of studies of the body and 
interiors (such as the Hammam series), which 
feature a high-contrast, chiaroscuro approach. 
By the end of the 1980s, Dridi had started 
to contribute to the newspaper Le Monde; had 
become a member of Creation Photographique 
de France (an association of French 
photographers); and had fulfilled commissions 
from the Coimbra festival of photography, to 
make a series of photographs exploring the 
cultural and religious conventions of that 
Portuguese town, and from the city of Almeria, 
Spain, to make another series on four 
Andalusian cities. Later, in his Mediterranean 
series, Dridi focused on the disparities and 
similarities between the Islamic-Hispanic world 
of Cordoba, Spain and the Arab world of Egypt, 
Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Tunisia, 
with particular attention to those nation's 
villages, women's experiences, and cultural 
identities. Dridi has exhibited his work 
throughout France (Aries. Montpellier, Paris, 
and Toulouse) and in Morocco, Portugal, Spain, 
Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United States. In 
1990, he became seriously ill and since then 
has been bedridden.

Statement 

As children, we used to watch our mothers 
pray. We would observe their gestures and 
movements discreetly and wait for this daily 
ritual to end before speaking to them. One had 



260 



Touhami Ennadre 



to take special care not to walk in front of 
them — not to come physically between them 
and the heavens — for that would nullify their 
prayers. This is why Kamel Dridi has always 
photographed his mother from the side, never 
head-on. 

Kamel has brought such moments back to 
life for all grown-up Maghreb children, moments 
when one's relationship with one's mother is 
momentarily interrupted while she is speaking 
to God. The child must respect this brief 
interruption. 

More than a memory, it is an image that 
infinitely repeats itself and lives on in us in 
modesty and nostalgia. In photographing 
women praying, Kamel was right to record only 
the movements of the veiled body prostrating 
itself in the direction of Mecca. These 
movements express a private experience of 
intense concentration that excludes us until the 
moment when the mother, remaining seated 
after having finished her prayers, joins her 
hands together and raises them to ask God to 
protect her children and lead them on the path 
toward Goodness, Kindness, and Truth. 

Our mothers prayed for us all their lives. 
Where would we be without their blessings? 
Where would they be without God's mercy? 
Kamel has captured the abstract quality of 
these spiritual values through these images, in 
which the world passes by at full speed, the 
light becomes secondary, and the violence of 
the outside world is thrust aside. 

Kamel Dridi sees with the eyes of an 
astonished child for whom real life is inward, a 
turning in on himself, a reflection and action 
focused on being worthy of another's gaze — 
the mother's. These photographs are moving 
because they are based not on seduction but 
on the simple desire to re-create timeless, 
everyday gestures.

Touhami Ennadre was born in 1953 in 
Casablanca, Morocco and moved in 1961 with 
his family to Paris, where he still lives. In 
1975, he learned that his mother was seriously 
ill, and he began to document the last year of 
her life as a way of preserving her memory. 
Ennadre had his first solo exhibition, in Pisa, 
Italy, in 1977. Since then, he has exhibited his 
works in galleries and museums throughout the 
world. 

From the late 1970s, his travels and what 
he calls "the experience of photography" have 
become more and more interconnected. In the 
late 1970s, he visited Burma, India. Indonesia, 
Malaysia. Nepal. Scandinavia, Singapore. 
Spain, and Thailand, producing a body of work 
that tends to frame a dramatic photographic 
encounter with the subject within the 
paradigms of birth and death experiences. 
Ennadre's subsequent travels in the 1980s 
and 1990s, to Canada, Germany, the United 
States, Italy, Morocco. Austria, Benin, Japan, 
Portugal, Switzerland. Spain, and Haiti, 
have been the source and the inspiration for 
his highly charged and idiosyncratic images.

Statement 

My approach is that of a plastic-arts 
photographer, which makes me difficult to 
classify: for photographers, I'm most often a 
plastic artist; for plastic artists, I'm merely a 
lens manipulator. 

My technique is shaped by my vision: I try 
most often to record forms in tension, and 
once I have some good prints I work the image 
like a draftsman. I believe the camera's 
viewfinder acts like a screen between my eye 
and the subject; it is therefore an obstacle. I 
have removed it from my camera. I rely on a 



constant focal length that my eye retains, and I 
always make photographs with a hand-held 
camera from the same distance, very close to 
the subject. This allows me to capture the 
image directly, unmediated. through a fixed 
system of settings that is the same in all my 
photographs. I work in 6 x 6 cm. I develop my 
own film and make trial prints of everything. 
Then I select about one photograph from every 
thirty or forty taken, and establish the series I 
am going to work on. This is the start of a 
very long working process. Each of my 
enlargements — usually about 1.2 x 1.6 m in 
size — is one of a kind, not because I am 
unwilling to duplicate, but because the nature 
of my work demands it. Indeed, for each 
photograph I draw a series of overlays and vary 
the exposure time: as a result, one photograph 
may be similar to another, but will never be 
identical to it. In this sense, the uniqueness of 
each piece makes my work as much like plastic 
art as like photography. For example, printing a 
large-format work, with all the trials and 
drawings and cutting of overlays that this 
entails, requires a minimum of twelve hours of 
work. Thus. I am a long way from those 
photographers who, once they have a 
satisfactory negative, can print it. or have it 
printed, in as large a number as they wish and 
in the format of their choice! 

After these technical considerations, some 
brief descriptions of already finished series: the 
first, which won me the Critics' Prize of the City 
of Aries in 1976. was a photo-reportage project 
on a cemetery, in which I attempted, from very 
close up. to capture the attitudes of people 
visiting that place of death. A face in front of an 
open grave, an eye here or there, living bodies 
in pain in this space of cold, lifeless stone. 
Each time I begin a series. I must find the body 
in a state of paroxysm. 

For another series. I visited a maternity ward 
every day for three months, where I witnessed 
women giving birth. This was not medical 
photography, but an interpretation of and 
variation on the tension of childbirth. My work 
transformed placentas into imaginary worlds. 

I also made a series on the subject of 
meat: I went to the slaughterhouses of Munich 
and saw carved-up carcasses that were as 
beautiful as a universe of pain. I am still 
working on the process of enlargement and 
transformation for this series of photographs. 

I believe that the photographer must 
confront the body pushed to the limit, confront 
it head-on. Without reproducing it, but rather by 
breaking it down and rearranging it. he 
must make it express what lies beyond its 
representation, beyond its inner cry.

Born in 1955 in Lagos, Nigeria, Rotimi 
Fani-Kayode fled to England with his parents 
immediately after the 1966 military coup. By 
then, his father had become the Bagolun of Ife 
(a high priest in this ancestral city important in 
Yoruba culture) and his family had been given 
the traditional title of Akire, keepers of the 
shrine of Ifa, the Yoruba oracle. Fani-Kayode 
studied in Somerset and Gloucestershire 
before attending Georgetown University, 
Washington, D.C., where he received a B.A. in 
art in 1980, and then Pratt Institute, New York, 
where he earned an M.F.A in 1983. He moved 
back to England that same year. During the 
rest of the decade, he exhibited photographs 
in numerous British galleries. His first solo 
exhibition was held in Nigeria in 1985. 

Fani-Kayode was a founding member and the 
first chairperson of Autograph, a London-based 
association comprised of and committed to 
black photographers, which was established in 
1987. In 1988, his book Black Male/White 
Male was published. Fani-Kayode died in 
December 1989 from complications associated 
with AIDS. Alex Hirst (a British photographer 
and Fani-Kayode's partner, who died in 1994) 
signed his name, along with that of Fani- 
Kayode, to many of the works by the Nigerian 
photographer. Today, the nature of the 
collaboration continues to ignite debate 
concerning the authorship, representation, 
appropriation, and meaning of Fani-Kayode's 
work.

Statement 

On three counts I am an outsider: in matters of 
sexuality; in terms of geographical and cultural 
dislocation; and in the sense of not having 
become the sort of respectably married 
professional my parents might have hoped for. 
Such a position gives me a feeling of having 
very little to lose. It produces a sense of 
personal freedom from the hegemony of 
convention. For one who has managed to hang 
on to his own creativity through the crises of 
adolescence and in spite of the pressures to 
conform, it has a liberating effect. It opens up 
areas of creative enquiry which might 
otherwise have remained forbidden. At the 
same time, traces of the former values remain, 
making it possible to take new readings on to 
them from an unusual vantage point. The 
results are bound to be disorientating. . . . 

An awareness of history has been of 
fundamental importance in the development of 
my creativity. The history of Africa and of the 
Black race has been constantly distorted. Even 
in Africa, my education was given in English in 
Christian schools, as though the language and 
culture of my own people, the Yoruba, were 
inadequate or in some way unsuitable for the 
healthy development of young minds. In 
exploring Yoruba history and civilisation, I have 
rediscovered and revalidated areas of my 
experience and understanding of the world. I 
see parallels now between my own work and 
that of the Osogbo artists in Yorubaland who 
themselves have resisted the cultural 
subversions of neo-colonialism and who 
celebrate the rich, secret world of our 
ancestors. 

It remains true, however, that the great 
Yoruba civilisations of the past, like so many 
other non-European cultures, are still 
consigned by the West to the museums of 
primitive art and culture. 

The Yoruba cosmology, comparable in its 
complexities and subtleties to Greek and 
Oriental philosophical myth, is treated as no 
more than a bizarre superstition which, as if by 
miracle, happened to inspire the creation of 
some of the most sensitive and delicate 
artefacts in the history of art. . . . 

In my case, my identity has been 
constructed from my own sense of otherness, 
whether cultural, racial or sexual. The three 
aspects are not separate within me. 
Photography is the tool by which I feel most 
confident in expressing myself. It is 
photography, therefore — Black, African, 
homosexual photography — which I must use 
not just as an instrument, but as a weapon 
if I am to resist attacks on my integrity and 
indeed, my existence on my own terms.

Samuel Fosso was born in 1962 in a small 
village in Cameroon, near the Nigerian border. 
By the time he was ten years old, he had 
moved to Bangui, the capital of the Central 
African Republic, which he adopted as his 
country and where he has been living ever 
since. For the first five months of 1975. he 
worked as a photographer's apprentice, and by 
the end of the year, at the age of thirteen, he 
had opened his first photography studio, the 
Studio National, followed a year later by his 
current studio, which he named Studio 
Confiance and later renamed Studio Gentil, 
Studio Hobereau, and Studio Convenance. 

In 1976. he began the large series of self- 
portraits that have made him one of the most 
admired African photographers of his 
generation. Since 1994. when he gained 
international attention at the exhibition 
Premieres Rencontres tie la photographie 
africaine, Bamako, Mali, he has participated in 
important shows in Paris and London, was 
awarded the Afrique en Creations Prize (1995), 
and has had a retrospective at the Centre 
National de la Photographie, Paris (1995).

Statement 

Bangui, November 1993: I am in the Central 
African Republic for a story on pygmies and for 
the preparation of the exhibition Premieres 
Rencontres de la photographie africaine. I 
enter the Studio Convenance. Portraits tacked 
to the wall surround a small counter. Behind 



263 



Jellel Gasteli 



the door, at the back of the shop, there is in 
fact a studio. Six large reflectors are affixed to 
a wall adorned with faded tapestries. 

Samuel Fosso, the owner, shows me the 
portraits he takes here. I ask him if he has 
more personal photographs, and he takes out 
some albums for me. I notice some self- 
portraits in black and white among the 
portraits of his family and friends. The next 
morning, before flying to Paris, Samuel 
entrusts me with fifty or so negatives. Looking 
at the contact sheets, I realize how astonishing 
some of these images are. 

A year later, I return to see Samuel, and he 
shows me other self-portraits. To make them, 
he chose certain backgrounds, sometimes 
painted by his friends, as well as costumes, 
accessories, and poses. Sometimes in the 
darkroom, he will superimpose images or 
inscribe maxims in Letraset relating to his own 
life. 

Fosso became a professional photographer 
by the age of thirteen. Since that time, his 
work has been a true search for identity, but it 
also traces, without his knowing it, an artistic 
itinerary that falls naturally into the current 
trends in photography today.

Born in 1958 in Tunis, Tunisia, Jellel Gasteli 
graduated in 1985 from the Ecole Nationale de 
la Photographie in Paris, where he currently 
resides with his family. In 1984, he traveled 
back to Tunisia and began his White Series 
(Serie blanche). In 1990, he traveled to 
Alexandria, Egypt as French Cultural Center 
artist-in-residence. That same year, Gasteli 
received grants from the French Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and from Kodak-Pathe, which 
allowed him to produce a photographic series 
on the city of Tangier, Morocco. As a result, in 
1991, he published the book Tanger Vues 
choisies, with a text by American writer Paul 
Bowles. 

In 1993, after participating in a group 
exhibition at the Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris 
and at Images of Africa in Copenhagen, he 
received the Villa Medicis prize (from the 
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and the 
National Prize for Photography (from the 
Tunisian Ministry of Culture). Also in 1993, 
Gasteli's photographs were published in the 
book Moroccans, with writings by Bowles, 
James Brown, William Burroughs, and Allen 
Ginsberg. Works from the White Series were 
exhibited at the Institut du Monde Arabe in 
1995.

Statement 

From time to time, ever since 1984, I have 
photographed the medina of Hammamet and 
the architecture of Djerba island's mosques. I 
seek to capture the purity of the walls, covered 
with several coats of whitewash, and to reduce 



buildings to their underlying cubic shapes. I 
inscribe in these images the sensations 
provoked by the tension between lines and 
surfaces saturated with light. Their multiple 
geometric combinations imperceptibly make 
their way toward abstraction. I play at replacing 
static perspective with dynamic flat surfaces. 
Although I was not aware of it when I began 
them, I realize now that in these very large 
prints, making up what I call the White Series 
[Serie blanche), I endeavored to capture the 
intense, pure spirit of place that I associate 
with my Tunisian childhood.

Meissa Gaye 



Christian Gbagbo 




Meissa Gaye was born in 1892 in Coyah, 
Guinea and moved with his parents to Saint- 
Louis, then Senegal's capital. Gaye, who was 
interested in painting, sculpture, and music, 
ended up excelling in photography. In 1910, he 
moved to the Congo to apprentice as a 
carpenter with his uncle. After arriving, he 
learned basic photography and bought his first 
materials from a French photographer. In 1914, 
he went to Conakry, where he worked as a 
customs official and then in the administration 
of Governor Ballay. In 1923, while working for 
the Delegation of Dakar, he continued to 
pursue photography, even constructing his own 
camera. 

He took a leave from his post from 1929 to 
1932 and moved to Kaolack, where he took up 
photography full-time, making his own enlarger 
and coloring some of his prints by hand. In 
1933, he returned to Dakar to the position he 
had vacated, and later he was given a post in 
Ziguinchor, which he held until 1939. After 
fighting with the French army in World War II 
and returning to Africa, he started taking 
photographs of other West African soldiers. In 
1945 in Saint-Louis, he opened his Tropical 
Photo studio, which became very popular. Gaye 
died in June 1982. 
— 0. Z. 

Statement 

"He was the first African photographer in the 
western part of the continent," asserts one of 
Meissa Gaye's daughters, Mrs. Awa Cheikh 



Gaye, now sixty-six years old. She adds. "If 
there were army recruits, he was the one to 
photograph them. When he came back from the 
war of 1939-45, he took photographs of 
Senegalese riflemen (Central Africans. 
Congolese, Senegalese, people from Cote 
d'lvoire). who in turn mailed them to their 
families to let them know they were alive and 
well. The women, too, would line up to be 
photographed." 

Gaye had been initiated into this art by a 
Frenchman in the Congo, and he did not fail, in 
turn, to teach photography to his sons and 
daughters. Unfortunately, one day one of his 
sons threw a few thousand of his father's 
negatives into the river. But others survived.

David Goldblatt 




Born in 1930 in Randfontein, a suburb of 
Johannesburg, South Africa, David Goldblatt 
started his career in 1963 and has exhibited 
extensively in his country and in Australia and 
Germany. He is one of the most internationally 
recognized African photographers and, for 
many, the great master of photography in South 
Africa. His professional work has involved a 
broad variety of assignments and commissions 
for magazines and businesses in South Africa 
and abroad. 

Goldblatt's noncommercial work, spanning 
almost fifty years, consists of a series of 
critical explorations of South African society, 
many examples of which are in important 
public collections, including the National 
Gallery, Cape Town; Johannesburg Art Gallery; 
Victoria and Albert Museum, London; 
Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris; and Museum of 
Modern Art, New York. He has had many books 
of his work published, two of which — On the 
Mines (1973) and Lifetimes under Apartheid 
(1986) — he worked on jointly with Nadine 
Gordimer, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize for 
literature. One of his best-known books 
is The Transported of KwaNdebele (1989). 
Goldblatt lives in Johannesburg.

Statement 

After the manner of this country, I had grown 
up among yet largely apart from Afrikaners. 
However I began to have more contact with 
them when, as a young man, I worked in my 
father's business. And I came gradually to feel 
a need to know more closely something of the 
life and values of people whose influence so 
pervaded the place of my birth and who, I 
realised, had long been a powerful presence in 
my own life. 

Those Afrikaners whom, at that time I came 
to know a little, were of our town and district. 
Miners, artisans, farmers from the Western 
Transvaal, plotholders from outside the town, 
small businessmen, minor officials, railwaymen 
and the families of these men: I was strangely 
affected by some of them, for they seemed 
to be imbued in great concentration with potent 
and often contradictory qualities that both 



moved and disturbed me. I know well the 
dangers of generalising and do so only to 
sketch most briefly: among these people there 
was austerity of spirit and lifestyle, and there 
was directness and uprightness; there was 
narrowness and there was floridity and 
lustiness; there was confidence and a sense of 
belonging, of knowing exactly who one is and of 
where one stands in the world; there was a 
tenacious conviction of Tightness, of absolute 
unarguable Tightness; there was an almost 
visceral bond with the soil and the bush, and in 
some, at the same time, a lack of regard for 
these; and withal, there was fear, and at times 
a terrible need to debase the feared. I was 
witness to acts of remarkable generosity of 
spirit — so much more than kindness — and to 
others of ungoverned meanness. Sometimes it 
seemed that all was there simultaneously in 
moments of impossible contradiction. 

So I came to photograph Afrikaners, moving 
slowly beyond the district and the people I 
knew. For a while, I thought of photographing 
the Afrikaner People. It took time to understand 
that for me such a project would be grossly 
pretentious and probably impossible to achieve 
in any meaningful sense — in any case it is not 
what I wanted. I did not have the encyclopedic 
vision that might enable me to achieve an 
acceptably "balanced" picture of a people. I 
was concerned with a few minutiae of Afrikaner 
life, with a few people. 

I needed to grasp something of what a man 
is and is becoming in all the particularity of 
himself and his bricks and bit of earth and of 
this place and to contain all this in a 
photograph. To do this, and to discover the 
shapes and shades of his loves and fears and 
of my own, would be enough.

Photographed (Sandhurst, Sandton: Murray 
Crawford, 1975), p. 7.

Ranjith Kally was born in 1925 into a working- 
class family in Isipingo, Natal province, South 
Africa. He worked in a shoe factory for fifteen 
years before embarking on his lifelong career 
as a photojournalist. At the age of twenty-one, 
he discovered his first camera, a secondhand 
Kodak Postcard. Kally joined the Durban 
International Camera Club in 1946 and became 
a regular contributor to his local newspaper, 
The Leader. In 1952, he won third prize in an 
international photography competition held in 
Japan. 

He stopped work at the shoe factory in 
1956. when he was hired by the Golden City 
Post as a staff photographer, and was a 
regular contributor to Drum magazine, covering 
the Durban area until 1965. In 1967, Kally was 
selected for membership in the Royal 
Photographic Society, London. From 1968 to 
1985, he again worked for Drum. Kally 
currently works as a freelance photojournalist 
for local newspapers and as a commercial 
photographer recording local social events. 
Kally's work has been included in several 
exhibitions, most recently the National Arts 
Festival in Grahamstown. South Africa in 1994 
and Margins to Mainstream: Lost South African 
Photographers at the Midlands Art Center in 
Birmingham, England in 1995.

Statement 

I was twenty-one at the time and while 
rummaging through the wares at a garage sale 
in Isipingo I happened upon a small Kodak 
Postcard camera which I bought for six 
pence. ... I was consumed by my newly found 
interest in photography and spent almost all 



267 



Seydou Keita 



my free time pursuing the art form. ... I 
remember doing my first enlargement in a 
makeshift darkroom in Plowright Lane, not from 
The Leader offices in Pine Street. We got under 
way at 8 pm and at 4 am we were cursing as 
the sun began rising, jeopardising our print. . . . 
In the earlier days, we had to envisage a whole 
host of diverse criterion before pressing the 
shutter. But modern equipment has taken the 
"sting" out of photography. It's a sorry state, 
for the future of press photographers, as we 
know them, is in jeopardy with the coming 
advances in technology.

Statement 

People will long be talking about the 
photographs of Seydou Keita, now seventy- 
three years old, whose rise to fame spans the 
1940s to the present. 

How did he come to this stage of African 
photography? "All my shots," he says, "were 
taken in the studio. On a few rare occasions 
my clients wanted to be photographed next to 
my car. Photography has always been my 
passion. I live for and through my photographs. 
This is why I have jealously preserved my 
negatives. In spite of everything, time has got 
the better of some of them. To fight the dust, I 
sometimes used to wash negatives during the 
night, so that they'd dry before morning; then I 
would file them away in paper boxes. I love all 
my photos, because I took them with love, and 
that is why in each photograph you will find at 
least one detail that pleases me: the decor, 
the look in the eyes, the subject's position, 
and so on. My wish is that my negatives will 
live on for a very long time." He smiles and 
then continues, "It is true, my negatives 
breathe like you and me." 
— Alioune Ba 



Seydou Keita was born in 1923 in Bamako, 
French Sudan (now Mali). He began taking 
pictures of his family and relatives in 1945, 
when his father brought him a camera from 
Senegal. Like most local photographers of 
his generation, Keita learned his medium's 
techniques from Mountaga Kouyate, an 
anticolonial intellectual who fought for the 
independence of French Sudan. In 1948, in 
Kouyate's Bamako studio, Keita started 
developing the pictures that eventually made 
him the most celebrated photographer from 
Mali. From 1949, the year he set up his own 
studio, until he retired in 1977, Keita created, 
and meticulously preserved, several thousand 
photographs, which represent an exceptional 
source of information about life in Bamako 
throughout the 1950s and 1960s. 

Since the end of the 1980s, Keita's 
photographs have been exhibited in Aries, 
Birmingham, Copenhagen, London, Paris, 
Rouen, and other European cities. Many of his 
works are in important European collections. In 

1994, the Fondation Cartier pour I'Art 
Contemporain, Paris published the monograph 
Seydou Keita, devoted to his oeuvre; and in 

1995, the Editions Lux Modernis, Paris 
released a cd-rom that comprehensively reviews 
Keita's studio work from 1949 to 1970. In 

1996, the National Museum of African Art, 
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 
presented the first United States retrospective 
of his career. Keita lives in Bamako.

Peter Magubane was born in 1932 in 
Vrededorp (now Pageview), a suburb of 
Johannesburg, South Africa, but grew up in 
Sophiatown. He started his career at Drum 
magazine in 1954. working as a driver for three 
months, then as a darkroom assistant for three 
months. Soon after that, Magubane went on 
assignment as a photographer, and in 1958 he 
received both first and third prizes for South 
Africa's Best Press pictures of the year. From 
1967 to 1980, he worked for the Rand Daily 
Mail. In June 1969, Magubane was arrested for 
alleged crimes against the state and was 
detained in Pretoria Central Prison. He was 
released in September 1971, but was banned 
from taking photographs for five years. 

Magubane has been especially committed to 
exposing the exploitation of children, and has 
spent much time covering social and political 
events in South Africa, in the course of which 
he has endured a number of serious hardships. 
From 1978 to 1980, Magubane worked for 
7"/me magazine as a foreign correspondent. 
After also leaving the Rand Daily Mail in 1980. 
he came to New York, and he continues to 
maintain a residence there as well as one in 
Johannesburg. From 1980 to 1984, Magubane 
worked for the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees in Somalia and 
Ethiopia. In 1985. he resumed work for Time 
magazine. Throughout his career, he has 
published ten books of photographs and has 
received numerous awards, including the 
Robert Capa Award in 1986. In 1992, the 
Missouri School of Journalism presented 
Magubane with the Missouri Honorary Medal 
foi Distinguished Service in Photojournalism 
for his lifelong coverage of apartheid.

Statement 

In my work, and in the kind of pictures I chose 
to produce, I wanted to liberate myself, liberate 
my people, liberate the oppressor and let the 
world understand through my images what we 
were going through, what apartheid meant. . . . 
to capture the images that would make the 
world understand why black people are so 



angry in this country of South Africa. I said to 
myself. "I don't care. If I die for the cause, so 
be it." If I see a picture. ... at all costs, I will 
try to get that picture. For example, in 1956 
there was a trial, and the press was banned 
from covering it — the whole trial was about the 
Bahurutse who had demonstrated against 
apartheid, all of whom had been arrested. 
Drum magazine was the only publication that 
covered the trial. Can Themba and I went into 
Zeerust. I was dressed like an ordinary rural 
person ... I got there . . . and went into the 
nearest store and bought myself a half a loaf of 
bread, put my camera into the bread, and went 
back and photographed the scene of the 
people arriving, while I pretended to be eating 
my bread. When I thought I had overdone this, 
and that they might discover me, I went back to 
the store, bought a pint of milk in a carton, 
drank the milk, and dried the carton and cut 
holes in it. I put my camera into the carton 
and went back and finished photographing the 
trial. . . . 

In those days you had to think fast. The 
authorities were really brutal. At one point, I 
asked myself if it was worth it to be so 
brutalized. But I knew how important it was 
that this work get done, how much it needed to 
be seen. In 1969. I was detained in solitary 
confinement for 586 days and then banned 
from taking pictures for five years after I was 
released. So I lost seven years of my 
photographic career. But that did not make me 
change; in fact, it made me more aggressive. 
In 1976, while I was covering the Soweto 
uprising, my nose was fractured. Getting my 
nose broken was painful, but when I was asked 
to open my camera and take out the roll of 
film . . . that was more painful. My broken nose 
could be repaired and the pain alleviated, but 
the images in my camera would be lost forever. 
I was detained with other journalists and spent 
another 123 days in prison. In 1985, I was 
shot below my waist with seventeen rounds of 
buckshot. Before this. I had been arrested 
numerous other times in the 1950s, and in 
1960 I received a six-month suspended 
sentence for "trespassing," and I was banned 
from entering any South African farm for three 
years because of a story I did on child labor. 

I had always read about the power of 
pictures and that the government had been 
made to succumb because of the image. I said 
to myself, I am going to use this instrument to 
the fullest. I will help liberate my country. I will 
help liberate my people — even those that are 
oppressing us I will help to liberate. It is a pity 
that over all these years the work of most 
South African photographers has not been 
seen because of apartheid and because of 
fear. It is only those photographers who did not 
fear that had their work seen around the world; 



269 



Santu Mofokeng 



I am one of those photographers. People have 
said that I am a good photographer. It is very 
difficult for me to say how good a photographer 
I am. I shall leave that judgment to the eyes of 
other people, who may say how they see my 
work, what my work portrays.

Santu Mofokeng was born in 1956 in 
Johannesburg, South Africa, where he still 
lives. His first series of works spans the years 
1982 to 1994. He began working freelance in 
1982 as a member of the Afrapix Collective, 
and then as a documentary photographer for 
the Institute for Advanced Social Research 
(formerly the African Studies Institute) at 
University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. 
The photographs he made during those twelve 
years, which show various aspects of life in 
South Africa's black townships, as effected by 
such significant events as the recent 
democratic elections, are mostly concerned 
with issues of how blacks are depicted by 
others, how they see and photograph 
themselves, and how they are represented by 
the media. Mofokeng's photographs have 
been exhibited in several cities in Africa and 
Europe, including Lille, London, New York, 
and Paris. Currently, Mofokeng is reconsidering 
his practice as a black photographer in 
postapartheid South Africa.

Statement 

Some of the pictures in this show have been 
exhibited and published in the United States 
before. They were chosen from various projects 
loosely linked under the rubric of biography. 
These works were made in the years when I 
was a freelance photographer, a member of the 
Afrapix Collective, and a photographer for the 
Institute for Advanced Social Research, where I 
am now based. While they were abstracted with 
no particular theme in mind, a feeling of 
unease permeates them all. 

When I began it, this project was conceived 
as a metaphoric autobiography. I saw my work 
then to be both a political imperative and an 
avenue for self-expression. Allow me to confess 
that in those days I was possessed of a 
compulsion, a pious zeal that gave me a kind 
of moral sanction, to explore our predicament. 
This I did in order to confirm and reassure 



myself of my own humanism, which I perceived 
to be the contested site in a historically 
polarized society. In choosing to highlight those 
aspects of our collective experience that 
emphasized our shared humanity, I hoped to 
show the ignominy of the rulers in those odious 
apartheid years. 

Lampposts was the title initially attached to 
this body of work. The image of the lamppost is 
drawn from the aphorism "lampposts like the 
masses are there to lean on or to piss on . . ." 
Many people, friends mostly, criticized the title 
as being at best cryptic or misleading, and at 
worst cynical. And although it is my belief that, 
in all fairness, it is not the fault of the 
lamppost that dogs pee on it, I changed the 
title to Rumours. I find the latter title to be 
particularly apt because of the collective 
amnesia that was previously a catalyst for, and 
has now become the product of, the peaceful 
transition to democracy in our country. It is my 
belief that the "miracle" of our nascent 
democracy was achieved out of a desire to 
forget. 

The "us and them" paradigm that informed 
my photography practice in the past has given 
way to an awkward "we," a fetus of doubtful 
pedigree. These images are glimpses of a 
rumored past. What do they mean?

G. R. Naidoo was born in 1928 in Natal 
province. South Africa and started working as a 
typist shortly after graduating from Springfield 
Methodist School. He studied part-time at 
M. L. Sultan Technical College, where he 
gained qualifications in accounting, 
bookkeeping, and secretarial practice. Before 
turning to writing and photography, Naidoo 
worked in trade-union administration, in the 
felt and leather industry, and subsequently in 
the hairdressing union. He became interested 
in photography after meeting Alfred Harper, a 
photographer and magician. 

Beginning in 1950, Naidoo worked as a 
photojournalist for such South African 
publications as Flick (covering the Indian 
community). Africa (where he was also a 
feature writer), and Graphic (an Indian family- 
oriented magazine). From 1955 to 1969, he 
worked at Drum as a writer, photographer, and 
editor. He spearheaded the launch of Drum's 
East Africa edition and in 1969 became 
Drum's editor-in-chief, the first black editor to 
occupy such a position in the magazine. 

Naidoo contributed enormously to the South 
African liberation struggle in his work as an 
investigative photojournalist in the 1950s and 
1960s, covering the infamous treason trials, 
the Rivonia trials, the Cato Manor uprising, 
the Defiance Campaign, and the Passive 
Resistance Campaign. In 1965, after he 
published a series of his photographs implicitly 
critiquing the government by focusing on the 
plight of South African blacks under apartheid, 
he was arrested by the South African security 
police and detained for ninety-seven days — the 
first journalist jailed there for his work. 
Naidoo's activities against apartheid earned 
him accolades from colleagues throughout 
South Africa. From 1971, he worked for the 
Rand Daily Mail, until it closed its Durban office 
in 1977. when he joined the Sunday Times. 
Naidoo died in 1982.

Lamia Naji 



Gopal Naransamy 




Born in 1966 in Casablanca, Morocco, Lamia 
Naji was introduced to photography during a 
stay in Paris in 1984. From 1988 to 1992, 
she spent most of her time in the United 
States. In 1992, she began a two-year project 
of photographing medinas and casbahs 
of Morocco. She exhibited a group of these 
photographs for the first time in 1993 at 
several galleries and exhibition spaces in 
Casablanca. Funded by a grant from UNESCO- 
Aschberg, she spent the fall and winter of 
1994-95 taking photographs in Italy. In 1995, 
she was invited by the Nederlands Foto 
Instituut Hollande to work in Rotterdam, where 
she remained until spring 1996. In the 
meantime, she has exhibited at the Musee 
Lillim in Carcassonne, France, again in 
Casablanca, and most recently in the 
Netherlands. 
— 0. Z. 

Statement 

The photographs presented here were taken 
during different trips through Morocco 
(1992-94) and Italy (1994-95). The works are 
primarily studies of light in the depths of 
darkness and reflect a profound desire for 
spirituality in a somber world or a flight from a 
harsh reality. People, when they appear, are but 
compositional objects, thereby becoming 
phantoms or spirits. This quest for light began 
in Morocco's medinas and casbahs, places 
that preserve a way of life, traditions, and the 
memory of a long-vanished past and that 
project their visitors beyond daily reality. 
However, the same approach is taken in so- 
called civilized countries such as Italy, where 
modernity has usurped the place of the dream.

Gopal Naransamy was born in 1927 in 
Vrededorp (now Pageview), a suburb of 
Johannesburg, South Africa. He received his 
formal education at the Eurafrican Training 
Center in Johannesburg and at Sastri College 
in Durban. Naransamy had no formal training in 
photography; his interest in the medium began 
after he received a Brownie box camera as a 
present for his eleventh birthday from his 
father, a prominent sports administrator. On 
December 16, 1938, he took his first 
photographs, of Voorstrekkers on horseback 
and in ox wagons as they commemorated their 
defeat of the Zulus at the Dingaans Day Parade 
on the streets of Vrededorp. Unable to afford 
studying for a medical career due to his 
family's limited finances, Naransamy turned to 
photography full-time, while working as a 
clothing salesman and a bookkeeper. In 1953, 
he received his first break, when he was hired 
by Drum magazine as a darkroom technician. 
He was later promoted to chief photographer 
and picture editor of the Golden City Post, 
Drum's sister publication. 

Because of the Group Areas Act he was 
forced to move to Lenasia, where he was a 
pioneering photographer in the community. 
Through the years, Naransamy had several run- 
ins with South African authorities, particularly 
for his coverage of the treason trials from 
1955 to 1962 and the Sharpeville massacre in 
1960. Today, Naransamy continues to 
contribute to the South African Globe, Lenasia 
Times, Indicator, and other South African 
periodicals. His book Gems, showing black 
history in the making, represents the highlight 
of his photographic career. He lives and works 
in Johannesburg.

Ricardo Rangel was born in 1924 in Lorenco 
Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique. While 
still in his teens, he started working in a 
photography lab as a darkroom assistant and 
later as a printer. In 1952, he joined the staff 
of Maputo's newspaper Noticias da tarde as its 
first nonwhite photojournalism but he felt 
constricted by the paper's conservative 
political agenda. Rangel left and began working 
for the newspaper Tribuna in 1960, which he 
quit in 1964. From 1964 to the end of 1969, 
he worked for various newspapers in Maputo 
and in Beira. 

In 1970, along with four other journalists, he 
founded the magazine Tempo, an illustrated 
weekly publication that was the first color 
magazine produced in Mozambique. Seven 
years later — two years after the independence 
of Mozambique — he was hired back by Noticias 
da tarde to instruct and direct a new 
generation of photojournalists. In 1981. he 
became the director of the weekly Domingo, 
and three years later he was invited to create 
the Centro de Formagao Fotografica in Maputo, 
which he directs today. Since 1983, Rangel 
has exhibited in European galleries and 
museums in Denmark, Germany, Great Britain. 
Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland, and in 
Africa in Mali, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and 
elsewhere.

Statement 

Ricardo Rangel, who was born of African, 
Greek, and Chinese heritage, spent most of his 
youth either in his black grandmother's house 
in Maputo or accompanying his parents to 
various provinces of Mozambique. The 
multifaceted cultures of his country marked 
him and created in him an unusual sensitivity 
to the feelings of others, which would always 
preoccupy him. 

Making up stories with images fascinated 
him in his childhood, when he spent hours 
play.ng shadow games, trying to visually 
evoke the essenre of an experience. As a 
teenager, Rangel had a rebellious yet 
sensible character and a strength of will that 
bordered on obstinacy. While working in a 



photography lab. he had to print photographs 
that offended his aesthetic and human 
sensibility. 

In 1952, under extremely difficult 
circumstances, he began to work for the 
newspaper Noticias da tarde. He had to play by 
the rules at this newspaper, which meant 
depicting only positive images of colonialism. It 
was only after 1960. when Rangel began to 
work for the newspaper Tribuna as chief of 
photographic reporting that he developed his 
understanding of photojournalism as the active 
expression of dissent, a revelation that 
profoundly changed the visual content of the 
daily newspapers of his generation. This 
freedom lasted only four years. In 1964. 
because of ideological differences, he left 
Tribuna with a group of other progressive 
journalists. 

Rangel's pictures express compassion for all 
human beings and outrage at injustice. The 
publication of many of his photographs was 
prohibited by colonial censorship, and a great 
number of his negatives were destroyed by the 
servants of colonial fascism.

Born in 1936 in Soloba, French Sudan (now 
Mali), Malick Sidibe was trained in handcrafted 
jewelry-making. After graduating in 1952 from 
the National School of Arts in Bamako, he went 
to work as an apprentice to Gege, a well-known 
photographer in the capital, and in 1956 he 
bought his first camera. Sidibe opened his 
Studio Malick in 1962. At first, he concentrated 
on photographing industrial subjects such as 
road construction and railroads. Later, he 
turned to the activities and social gatherings of 
young people, unlike his most popular 
colleagues in Bamako, who specialized in 
photographing the banquets, receptions, and 
ceremonies of the upper class. Sidibe spent a 
decade recording young Malians' weddings, 
parties, sporting events, and leisure activities. 
His photographs have been featured in several 
national and international exhibitions devoted 
to the most celebrated African photographers. 
In 1995, the Fondation Cartier pour I'Art 
Contemporain, Paris, presented an exhibition 
of Sidibe's work from 1962 to 1976. Sidibe 
lives in Bamako.

would go out to record the atmosphere of 
dance parties, ceremonies, weddings, and, 
occasionally, he made excursions to the beach. 
This activity left the photographer with vivid 
mementos of the young people of the 1970s. 

In youth, he discovered spontaneity and 
health, warmth and sociability. Today, we again 
find in his photos these same qualities that 
Malick forever captured for the delight of our 
eyes.

There are some photographers who have done 
only studio work. For years, they captured the 
gazes and costumes of their subjects in the 
studio. Today, their gaze bears compelling 
witness to the history of their country. Malick

Ike Ude 




Born around 1964 in the Igbo region of 
Makurdi, Nigeria, Ike Ude has lived and worked 
in New York City since 1981. After studying 
at Hunter College, City University of New 
York, Ude started his artistic career in the 
late 1980s, using photography to explore and 
deconstruct issues of representation, 
culture, race, gender, and sexual identity. His 
ongoing research has broadened the scope 
of his inquiry beyond the conventional 
parameters of photography to engage forms 
of mass communication, including magazines, 
videos, films, and television. Ude's work 
usually consists of elaborate installations 
that he links to related projects presented 
at the same time, such as collaborative works, 
publications, lectures, and performances. 
Ude has participated in solo and group 
exhibitions in many galleries and museums 
in the United States. He is also the publisher 
and editorial director of the magazine aRUDE, 
which focuses on urban culture and alternative 
lifestyles.

Statement 

Contemporary aesthetics are frequently 
sympathetic to exigent cultural, social, and 
political issues. Such sympathy has always 
been at the core of my artistic practice. The 
photographic medium — whether as an archival 
material derived from a wide range of sources, 
or as an instrument to denaturalize certain 
fixed notions of representation — is malleable 
and can suggest a whole range of views and 
ideas about individuals, communities, 
identities, etc. My photographic work embraces 
all these variables, whether I am using the 
more conventional approach of camera and 
light or the more technical approach of digitized 
images via computers. 

As an artist, I constantly traffic across 
varying boundaries. I have found that, 
irrespective of ideological rhetoric, any strict 
adherence to a single cultural approach is 
flawed and practically impossible. Moving 
from one place to another not only provides 
me with new sensations, backgrounds, and 
frameworks through which to view things. 



but also challenges my predisposition toward 
the familiar. 

Multiculturalism cannot be something that 
is, from time to time, an intellectual fashion. 
My country of birth. Nigeria, is only thirty-five 
years old as a nation. In so becoming, there 
were enormous costs. Nigeria is arguably a 
Active nation created by the British colonial 
hegemony and populated by Nigerians. 
Consider that the two major religions in Nigeria. 
Islam and Christianity, are both imported. 
Consider the linguistic imperialism that 
progressively vitiated my first language. Igbo, 
and consequently necessitated my use of 
English in speech and writing. Consider this 
morass of international influences on me and 
what is left of my culture. Now consider me and 
my work. 

Looking beyond colonial impediments, I see 
the circumstances of my artistic practice and 
identity as inextricably informed by the 
multiplicity of conflicting cultural influences I 
have inherited and delineated to serve myself. 
It is little wonder that I am nobody's artist but 
my own. 

I dedicate Uses of Evidence to the memory 
of my beloved mother, Nnebemchi UdeAgu, and 
my brother Ndu UdeAgu. who recently passed 
away.
