Sponsor's Statement 



The exhibition dedicated to Mario Men ' 
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
represents an event fully deserving of 
our interest and pride. It is an important 
moment both for the artist, who is given 
the opportunity to show his works 
in a prestigious setting, and for Italian 
contemporary art, which is being 
introduced to the American public 
through the works of one of its masters. 
This is most gratifying for Gruppo GFT 
and for The Rivetti Art Foundation 
which have supported the exhibition. 
This has not come about by mere chance. 
The Rivetti Art Foundation is the 
embodiment of an intense and passionate 
commitment to the evaluation and 
promotion of contemporary art. 
In existence for two years, The Rivetti Art 
Foundation acquires contemporary works 
of art. During this first phase of its 
activity, the foundation has been 
concerned primarily with Italian art, and 
has developed a special relationship with 
the creative movement that evolved in 
Italy in the 1960s known as Arte Povera. 
The Rivetti Art Foundation is involved 
as well with the coproduction and 
promotion of exhibitions, other cultural 
events, books, videos and various 
art publications. 

Gruppo GFT, an international company 
in the field of apparel and fashion, has 



had a longstanding relationship with 
contemporary art, a relationship that 
is intensifying with every passing year. 
Collaboration with major museums of 
contemporary art, such as the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum of 'New York, 
the Museum of Contemporary Art of Los 
Angeles, the Centre Pompidou of Paris 
and the Museo d'Arte Contemporanea, 
Castello di Rivoli, of Turin, of which 
Gruppo GFT was a founding t??ember, 
are all significant chapters of this 
involvement. We are bound to 
contemporary art for profound reasons: 
ours is a group that works in continuous 
and close contact with taste, creativity 
and fashion. Looking at contemporary 
art alloivs us to view the metamorphosis 
of collective taste and continuously yields 
new suggestions and directs our daily 
tasks towards imagination and creativity. 
In this area of collaboration, the Mario 
Merz exhibition represents an important 
step both for Gruppo GFT and The 
Rivetti Art Foundation. These words 
testify not only to our satisfaction with 
this exhibition, but also to our gratitude 
towards all those who made it possible.

Foreword 



The present retrospective of the work 
of Italian artist Mario Merz, organized 
by Germano Celant, Curator of 
Contemporary Art, is a rare event. 
Perhaps not since the momentous 
exhibition of the art of the late Joseph 
Beuys at the Guggenheim ten years ago 
has there been such a fortuitous 
coincidence of an artist, a career of work, 
a curator who is also a collaborator, and 
a particulary appropriate architectural 
milieu. What is more, the institution itself 
has reached an important moment in its 
history. This show demonstrates that even 
as the Museum prepares for the complete 
restoration of its aging landmark building, 
a process necessitating its closing for 
approximately eighteen months, it is 
seeking to extend its distinctive reach 
towards Europe and beyond, 
and to advance its historic participation 
in contemporary culture. 
Men's art and the work of his Italian 
colleagues loosely grouped under the 
banner of Arte Povera (a term coined 
by Celant) have made a profound 
contribution to the artistic culture of this . 
century. Like poetic vagabonds, using 
whatever materials they find at hand 
— discarded objects or fragments of stone, 
glass, fabric, metal, newspapers and other 
ephemera - or immaterial elements - 
light, fire, steam, frost - in surprising and 
provocative configurations, these artists 
have interrogated and challenged an 
increasingly industrial and mechanistic 
world. Merz s objects - igloos, fruit 
on spiral glass tables, paintings on 
unstretched canvas, reptiles crawling 
on ivalls and ceilings, neon molded to 
eccentric handwriting - all embody the 
dialectic between man-made and organic 
forms. The Fibonacci numerical sequence, 



a signature element in Merz's work, is 
a representation of organic growth and the 
natural spiral. In its essentially flexible 
spherical and serpentine forms, Merz s 
art sustains a natural dialogue with 
Frank Lloyd Wright 's spiral monument. 
Equally momentous as the encounter 
of art and architecture is the equation 
between artist and critic. It was 
a personal, almost obsessive, relationship 
between the Guggenheim 's first Director 
Hilla von Rebay and the art and ideology 
of Vasily Kandinsky that helped establish 
this Museum. Appropriately, the exchange 
between Merz and Celant revealed in the 
interviews that follow in this catalogue 
document a dialogue of almost twenty- 
five years that should be considered 
a veritable collaboration in forming 
central ideas. 

One of several recent critical curatorial 
and administrative appointments, Celant s 
addition to the staff signals the 
Guggenheim's determination to remain 
a formative contributor to an increasingly 
international arena of twentieth-century 
visual culture. The dual Italian-American 
identity of the Guggenheim museums in 
Venice and New York provides a unique 
international platform for this endeavor, 
which was represented in the installation 
last month of four new Merz pieces 
in the palazzo and garden of the 
Peggy Guggenheim Collection. Merz's 
enveloping and organic presence around 
the totality of Wright s spiral represents, 
as the restoration of the building begins, 
the principal of the Guggenheim's 
continuing growth.

Acknowledgments 



An exhibition of work by Mario Merz 
is by its very nature a complicated 
endeavor. The variety of scale, 
the fragility and the often poignant 
ephemerafity of the materials Merz 
employs in his art must be considered a 
challenge to the routine of the institution. 
Works by Merz can never be installed the 
same way twice. For all of these reasons 
and more, the present retrospective, 
involving the entire Frank Lloyd Wright 
spiral, is a singular achievement, the 
product of the enormous labor, patience 
and dedication of the staff of the 
Guggenheim and of others who 
participated in its making. 
First, it must be emphasized that while 
this exhibition includes Mario Merz s 
work from the 1950s to the present, 
attaching the term "retrospective" to it 
is provisional at best. Merz s continual 
recombination of elements from different 
works and the organic mutation of one 
sculpture into another make his objects 
difficult to date or even to distinguish 
from one another. Thus, like most of his 
installations, this retrospective is a unique 
event that has required and depended 
on Mario Merz himself, and also on the 
collaboration of Marisa Merz, in every 
way. In embodying Merz's vital 
contribution to our culture, it may in itself 
be considered one of his greatest works. 
Projects of this scale and quality cannot 
be produced without sponsorship. In the 
case of Gruppo GFT and The Rivetti Art 
Foundation, cofunders of the present 
undertaking, sponsorship must be 
considered partnership. Marco Rivetti, 
with Roberto Balm a and Anna Martina 
of GFT, has supported the exhibition in 
every phase of its planning and execution. 
Marco Rivetti' s personal attention 
and commitment to contemporary art, 
and the encouragement he, his company 
and his foundation have given to artists 
and institutions are rare indeed, and the 
Guggenheim is grateful for its association 
with Mr. Rivetti and Gruppo GFT. 
Mario Merz's work is sought worldwide. 
We are fortunate to have had the 
encouragement and collaboration of 
lending sister institutions who, like the 
Guggenheim, are entrusted with the care 
and preservation of objects of cultural 
importance. 



The greatest risks in terms of supporting 
contemporary art and bringing it to the 
attention of the public are often taken 
not by public institutions but by private 
collectors and galleries. Christian Stein 
and Gianfranco Benedetti of Galleria 
Christian Stein of Milan and Turin, 
and Barbara Gladstone and her gallery 
in New York have been exceptionally 
generous in their personal and financial 
commitment to Merz and this exhibition 
project. Several significant new works 
could not have been constructed without 
their assistance. Ileana Sonnabend, whose 
ongoing support of major artists and 
movements of the last thirty years 
is legendary, was an early champion 
of Merz's work. Along with Antonio 
Homem, she was crucial to the realization 
of the exhibition. Antonio Tucci Russo 
of Turin and Sperone Westwater Gallery 
of New York were also involved from the 
project 's beginning. My thanks go as well 
to all of the collectors and galleries 
making generous loans to the exhibition. 
A project of this scale touches the entire 
staff of the Museum and consumes the 
full attention of many. Thomas Padon 
professionally and delicately managed, 
overall, the significant curatorial and 
logistical problems posed by every aspect 
of the exhibition; he was ably assisted 
by interns Thomas Seydoux, Paula 
Billingsley and Patricia de Alvear. 
Luisa De Vettor, assistant to Germano 
Celant in Genoa, who has worked over 
the long term on the forthcoming 
systematic catalogue of Merz's work, has 
contributed research to the present 
publication. This catalogue was brought 
to fruition in a precious few months by 
a dedicated and indefatigable team. Nancy 
Spector, Assistant Curator for Research, 
with Jennifer Blessing, in collaboration 
with Manager of Information Systems 
Richard Roller, assembled, computerized, 
researched and shaped the sizable 
documentation. We also express our 
gratitude to The Museum of Modern Art 
Library, which has been exceptionally 
generous with its resources. The 
publication itself is the product of the 
acumen, precision and resilience of Editor 
Carol Fuerstein and Assistant Editor 
Diana Murphy, who received essential 
help from intern Jeanhee Kim. Thanks 



also are due Joachim Neugroschel for his 
facility with the Italian tongue and his 
sensitivity to the subtleties of the text. 
In Milan, Pierluigi Cerri, with Andrea 
Lancellotti, applied his intuition and 
imagination to the design and concept 
of the catalogue and posters. The staff 
of Electa, unth Tiziana Quirico, likewise 
lent its energies to the production 
of the book. 

As the only exhibition of a single living 
artist ever to occupy the entirety of the 
Wright spiral, its actual installation has 
been an extraordinarily complicated task. 
That Merz's work sustains a provocative 
and compatible dialogue with Wright 's 
elegant but formidable building is 
certainly due in large part to the artist 's 
and architect 's shared desire to balance 
organic forms and industrial materials. 
Yet this dialogue could not have been 
achieved without the superb preparation 
and installation crew that made the 
exhibition a reality. Scott Wixon, Dennis 
Schoelerman, Timothy Ross, Peter Costa 
and An i Rivera, as well as the artist's 
assistants Mariano Boggia and Ryoichi 
Hayashi, led a skillful, patient and 
tireless team. The works and various 
materials that comprise them were 
shepherded to the Museum from 
international sites under the deft guidance 
of Assistant Registrar Victoria Hertz. 
Finally, it is an unusual dynamic between 
the institution and the individuals who 
comprise it that makes a historic event 
like this possible. The exhibition is in 
a real sense the result of the imagination 
and devotion of Germano Celant, 
Guggenheim Curator of Contemporary 
Art. As a critic and proponent of 
contemporary art for the last twenty-five 
years, Celant has provided much more 
than insightful commentary; he has 
helped to shape the field of play. As the 
Guggenheim moves towards the end of 
the century whose art it has set out to 
document, Germano Celant will be a key 
shaper of the institution 's future purpose.

Nomadic Cartography 

In 1945, at the end of the war, I was in 
prison for political reasons, and I did a 
portrait of another prisoner, a man with a 
huge, red heard.... I never once lifted the 
pencil from the paper.... When I left prison, 
I went straight to the countryside to do some 
drawings of grass, the same way I did the 
portrait. But this time, I went outdoors in 
the morning and headed for the field. The 
period of drawing in the field was the period 
of marking, which continued from dawn to 
dusk, ana always with the same method: I 
never once removed the pencil from the 
paper. I stopped towards sundown, and the 
fact that I had spent all day drawing that 
endlessly convoluted line, like a tangle of 
intestines, and never lifted the pencil, al- 
lowed me to think. I had spent the whole 
day thinking, following my thoughts and 
everything happening around me - for 
example, the twittering birds, the falling 
leaves, the distant rumble of a van. All these 
things entered the drawing, not in a natural 
way, of course, but as time, as a recording, 
as if the pencil lead were the point of certain 
instruments registering on a sheet of paper: 
the point keeps rotating, it records the 
humidity, the temperature, the noises, the 
sounds. ' 

In order to understand Mario Merz's artistic 
explorations, we must first review the ideas 
that molded his earliest works, earliest 
procedures, earliest impulses. By affirming 
the basic value of his linguistic matrices and 
process matrices, we can make his scope and 
norizon comprehensible. We have to start 
with his imprisonment for anti-Fascist 
views, during which time and afterwards he 
ventured into the labyrinth of drawing. In 
his drawings, he deposited, as if on a 
photographic plate, the results of his feel- 
ings about the world and himself. His 
exercises and practice brought forth a 
"portrait" and then a "landscape," both of 
which he drew without lifting his pencil 
from the paper. Together with subsequent 
equally important pieces, such as the 1952 
Leaf (Foglia) paintings and the great 1963 
painting Crustacean (Crostaceo), done in 
Pisa, those drawings set up an ensemble of 
meanings which, when made evident, can 
define the future coordinates of Merz's 
artistic evolution. 

More than anything, the combination of 
social commitment with the search for a 



personal and different language reveals a 
desire to participate directly in the libera- 
tion from various current ways of thinking 
and communicating. Merz intended to forge 
new perspectives. On the one hand, after 
joining the partisan group Giustizia e 
Libertd (Justice and Liberty) in the struggle 
against Fascist ideology and oppression, ne 
was arrested and imprisoned. On the other 
hand, inspired by the same radical princi- 
ples, he turned to painting in order to 
appropriate an alternative way of seeing. 
The correspondence between those two 
aspects already indicates a possible coales- 
cence of political and cultural involvement, 
which led to a consciousness of the histori- 
cal and individual situation. In this way, 
Merz achieved an identity as an intellectual 
and an artist, who, while not forsaking the 
truly personal, kept confronting or dissent- 
ing, relating to or synchronizing with the 
culture of his era. 

The discovery of the cultural or artistic 
dimension, as historically determined by 
interaction with the "situation" and hence 
with everyday life, is confirmed by works 
that Merz did during his imprisonment or 
immediately afterwards, during the days of 
the Liberation. (Unfortunately, those pieces 
were lost or destroyed.) Still, the artist 
speaks of drawings he executed on any 
paintable or drawable surface that he man- 
aged to find in prison: wrapping paper, 
tissue paper, newsprint. He would draw 
figures or faces moved by internal agitation 
and a linear seething. These images, which 
gradually overflowed into Merz's surviving 
paintings of the 1950s, reveal a Surrealistic 
and Expressionistic conviction, tvpical of 
postwar painting, when Italian and Europe- 
an art tried to overcome its dilemma of 
being trapped between the extremes of 
Realism and Abstraction. That was the time 
of the Neorealist cinema of Roberto Rossel- 
lini and Luchino Visconti and the illustra- 
tional, propagandistic and narrative vision 
of a Marxian Socialist Realism. These 
approaches were confronted and challenged 
by the chromatic and linear essentialism of 
abstract art, which was starting to unmoor 
itself from the teleology of design and pure 
form, when the Bauhaus closed shop and 
turned into industrial technologism. 
Merz attempted to sidestep the two risks 
by practicing his own form of brinkmanship 
between them: "1945: Is art a solitary

solution? Is art a public solution? Did art 
actually manage to unite two highly diverse 
ways of acting and achieve a compromise?" 2 
Merz's prison "portrait" and his subse- 
quent "landscape" stake off a territory in 
which his art seems to assimilate his 
environment: the prisoner among prisoners 
or the field in which the painter stations 
himself. The radius of action is entered by 
a contingent force, which is vital, because 
the artist has looked around and recorded 
his experience. But what is the method of 
his recording? Merz finds it m the seismo- 
graphic process of drawing and painting: a 
face situated in a condition, closed or open, 
is transformed into a sensitive registering 
device, a sort of seismometer that can record 
or transmit, on paper or canvas, the emo- 
tional and environmental earthquakes that 
stimulate it. 

This kind of immersion in everyday experi- 
ence can last for whole days, resulting in 
just a single drawing, tortuous and intricate, 
made up of continuous lines and contours, 
translating the artist's inner changes, his 
reactions to a context. The arabesque is not 
planned; hence it is born not a priori but 
a posteriori, emerging as it does from the 
creative experience. In this way, it is 
characterized by its total subjectivity (the 
artist is the fulcrum of the sensorial and 
sensitive registration) and by its necessary 
objectivity (registration and recording), 
both of which are integrated and realized. 
The threshold of contact between the two 
is present time, so that the criterion of 
artistic implementability resides not in a 
future dimension of infinity and Utopia, but 
in the contingency and necessity of the hie 
et nunc. 

This invention of the landscape sinks its 
roots into the landscape itself, almost as if 
the artist were a nomad feeding on everyday 
life and living off the mobility of the 
territory he traverses. It is no fluke that 
Merz's line on the paper goes on almost 
infinitely, disrupted only by sunset and 
weather, and giving shape to a labyrinth 
that becomes an image. This demonstrates 
that the act of drawing, of making art, is 
"existence in motion," a continuous mov- 
ing and straying that involve the appropria- 
tion and deepening of the surrounding 
space - a Verwinding, to use a Heideggerian 
term. This anarchic and liberating passage 
led to the 1953 painting Gypsy Wagon 



(Carrozzone) - a visual metaphor for a 
Gypsy attitude, which sees vagabonding 
through the world as a way of life. 
According to this notion, art, for Merz, can 
be neither a transcendental and metaphysi- 
cal representation nor a psychological re- 
flection; rather, it is a passage from material 
to material, from the same to the same, in 
which the present and the occasion count, 
as does meeting oneself in motion. 
A further deepening of the essence of this 
nomadism, in a "time [that] continues and 
never stops. ..which binds up everything," 3 
was assigned to the Leaf paintings, done in 
1952 and first exhibited^ that year at the 
Galleria d'Arte La Bussola, Turin. Such 
works, put in relation to the content and 
the historical moment in Italy, are large- 
format canvases, in which the oil paint is 
dense and fleshy, practically a living bark. 
Merz's technique is to create impastos that 
conjure up the entanglements of life. Those 
same colors form tortuous and intricate 
lines; they seem vulnerable to constant 
change, interweaving into small natural and 
vegetable entities such as rocks and saw- 
dust. They signal a "where" composed of 
materials and signs, whose value is intrinsic, 
in the action of the hand or in its radius of 
intervention. Furthermore, the configura- 
tion of the image, the leaf, dissolves into the 
structure; hence it seems intent on exposing 
the skeleton and the veins and arteries 
rather than the vegetable surface. It is as 
if, for Merz, painting, the making of art, 
means acting in a void in order to fill it and 
thereby fill one's own existence. The artist 
is looking for existential organicity in the 
architectural and social structures. In fact, 
according to Merz's definition, "the leaf had 
become a symbol; the symbol of the organic 
whole";" 1 it even adapts itself, as a real bark, 
to the structure of a wall: 
Thus, leaves were enormous only because 
I realized that walls were big and leaves 
were attaching themselves to walls. I wanted 
to do a painting that would relate to the wall, 
not just to its internal image; and so the 
internal image adapted itself to the external 
relationship. 5 

And if the outside is adjusted to the inside, 
then painting too will follow gravitational 
forces, it will remain suspended on the wall 
like a creeping vine or it will rise from the 
ground, following the force of the wind: 
My paintings should not necessarily be hung

on the wall, they can be placed on the floor 
or attached to the ceiling.... It's good for 
paintings to start occupying a position in 
space, just like a chair or a table, which are 
useful in everyday life. b 
The cyclical and dialectical character of the 
leaf painting celebrates the degree of energy 
absorption in Merz's art, which strives to 
catalyze the field of sensations and environ- 
mental stimuli in which it is inscribed. His 
works thus reflect a development that 
assimilates the surrounding totality, linking 
up with the notion of growth and death, 
becoming a raw material of germination and 
proliferation. Rethought in terms of a 
contemporary perspective, which includes 
the igloo and the spiral table, the leaf 
painting is a perimeter or enclosure; it 
stakes off a territory made up of flakes and 
fragments, soils and colors, blending into 
a "bark," a surface of isolation and shelter, 
which, however, grows progressively, like 
a spiral. 

In 1963, Merz executed that same surface 
of progressive growth on a canvas, a true 
catalyst of material and experience, by 
reversing and spreading out all the pigments 
he had bought in the chy of Pisa during the 
course of a year. The accumulation pro- 
duced a painting bark "fifteen centimeters 
[six inches] thick,"' which was scheduled 
to be shown at the Promotrice delle Belle 
Arti in Turin; unfortunately, it shattered. 
This opus testified both to the passage of 
time, one year, and to the artist's activity 
during that period. The consequence was 
a painting qua vortex, taking in all external 
and internal factors, traversed by stratifying 
data and visions that canceled one another 
out, transcending and negating one another. 
It was a black hole in space and time, where 
nothing was static or conscious. The viewer 
had to enter it and lose his way in order to 
verify it as an always open transmission 
network traversed by energies and signs: the 
pulsation of neon, with its discharge of 
light, which would pass through the jutting 
canvases and everyday objects, was affirmed 
several years later. 

Nevertheless, before going on to Merz's 
great three-dimensional and architectural 
works, we have to deal with another 
background factor: the theme of light as a 
flux that illuminates and joins opposite 
polarities in order to create a unified 
physical and intellectual field. 



In 1956, Merz painted several versions of 
The Welder (II saldatore), the figure of a 
nocturnal worker, illuminated by the 
whooshing blowtorch, which shoots out 
fire and cuts rails. The depicted light energy 
stands for motion and its speed; it traverses 
space and connects two instants or two 
positions, signaling an interval or making 
the duration and distance between two facts 
intelligible. Hence, it is a major instrument 
of consciousness; in fact, it "illuminates," 
it institutes the trajectory linking two 
points, fusing them into a compromise and 
making them participants in the same 
continuum. 

This total field is a kind of energy cloud: 
"I see all my output of 1950," says Merz, 
"almost like premedieval painting, from an 
era in which painting, for the medieval 
world, meant entering a cloud...." 8 Here, 
the artist moves, finding the equivalence, 
the equalizing, of abstraction and figura- 
tion. The infinite possibilities of form are 
then explored from Seed in the Wind (Seme 
nel vento) to Tree (Albero), both painted in 
1953, which pass from Vasily Kandinsky's 
cult of the nonobjective image to Jean 
Dubuffet's figurative discursiveness. 
The incursion across the frontier between 
figuration and abstraction helps us to 
imagine indistinct territories teeming with 
confused things, between painting and 
sculpture — things like branches and fronds, 
forests and trees, chestnuts and twigs. 
Every entity moves amid similar entities, 
yet is different because it presents an 
autonomous form and position while shar- 
ing the same osmotic pressure. Every entity 
has an umbilical cord, which ties it to the 
next one, placing it in sequence as in a series 
of numbers: we are approaching the neon 
numbers, according to the Fibonacci pro- 
liferation. 

From the viewpoint of art history, the 
search for a continuum in Mario Merz's 
oeuvre from 1945 to 1963 not only reveals 
a harmony, an identification with the typi- 
cal material of Dubuffet and Jean Fautrier; 
in its quest for organicity with the territory 
of experience and contingency, that phase 
of Merz's work evinces a clear analogy with 
the positions of Situationism, a politico- 
cultural movement that charged through 
Europe from 1948 to 1957, making strong 
headway in Italy, especially Turin/' In 
particular, his awareness of Situationism

came from his frenzied discussions, starting 
in 1960, with Pinot Gallizio, an artist from 
Alba. Previously, in 1955, Gallizio, who 
had already met Asger Jorn, had founded 
the International Movement for an Imagist 
Bauhaus, which advocated an antifunction- 
alism close to Guy Debord's Situationist 
propositions. 

Merz has always refused to identify his 
paintings with the Surrealist and Informel 
figurations of Jorn and Karel Appel, Con- 
stant and Gallizio. He claims that his 
referent during that period was Jackson 
Pollock, saying that if you consider Pollock 
it's like Boccioni, but if you consider Appel, 
its like a certain degeneration of late Picas- 
so, an Existentialism of the surface. Never- 
theless, a certain correspondence with the 
methods of Situationism is obvious in Merz. 
A distinct rapport can be found in their 
mutual interest in the interaction between 
motion and the urban territory. In fact, in 
1956, Debord spoke of the "drift" - a 
process of random and unplanned move- 
ment across various spaces, a movement 
also defined as psychogeographic. The idea 
is to identify a method of lucidly and 
dynamically accentuating an urban draw- 
ing, reacting to it in terms of the found 
situation. It is a process of letting go in a 
random field of energy, a street or a house, 
outside or inside, in order to find a possible 
appointment with a mental situation, that 
of an "experience" on which, subsequently, 
one can build a new habitat. This motoric 
denouement within a process of experienc- 
ing, of feeling found things in situ is, as we 
have seen, also shared by Merz; except that 
he does not express himself in kilometric 
paintings, like Gallizio, or in radiating and 
polvcentric paintings, like Jorn. For Merz, 
making art consists of sowing a forest of 
inextricable and indistinguishable signs, 
giving life to a throng of words from the 
flow of inconstancy, in which gestures and 
things, put in circulation by the artist, have 
something of a winding motion that does 
not differentiate among the various ener- 
gies. These can sometimes become percepti- 
ble and recognizable, in the guise of uncer- 
tain and changing figures (a leaf, a tree, the 
human shape, a Gypsy wagon, a flowery 
rock, a seed in the wincT and so on). 
Nevertheless, the ultimate result will trace 
a strange and sometimes hazardous geogra- 
phy, delimiting a territory in which oppo- 



sites, such as day and night, matter and 
concept, conscious and unconscious, are 
able to coexist. 

Merz's paintings from 1949 to 1963 - 
emblems of his organic rapport with the 
world and the things around him - are 
verified even in terms of the artistic activi- 
ties of that era: for example, European 
Informel as well as American Action Paint- 
ing and Abstract Expressionism. What 
distinguishes Merz's works? Let us focus on 
a few telling examples. 
While Fautrier's Hostages, 1944, and Du- 
buffet's Texturologies, 1957, with their 
materials and drips, try to evoke social 
phenomena, from Nazi massacres of prison- 
ers to the teeming of urban crowds, Mario 
Merz's paintings insist on the values inher- 
ent in the everyday life of the solitary 
individual. Contrary to a known and famili- 
ar reality, Merz's paintings pursue the 
unfamiliar in everyday experience, the erot- 
ic, sensual osmosis with the environmental 
conduit found during his own journey. 
Fautrier and Dubuffet "document" a histor- 
ical course, the rhythm of a life that, with 
a dramatic or candid, a critical or ironic eye, 
derives from the events of a culture. On the 
other hand, Merz, using himself as a 
sensitive needle, tries to draw a map in 
which the archetypes of the individual's 
feeling and living solidify as they move 
through differentiated territories. Thus, art 
for Merz is not a narrative; rather, it bears 
witness to an instantaneousness of time, 
which can last for days or even months: in 
a field or in the city of Pisa. Hence, the 
absence of any swift, rapid gestures that 
pour or trace signs on a canvas, a la Pollock 
and Lucio Fontana; instead, we find an 
obsessive repetition of a linear and chromat- 
ic drawing that tends to stop only "towards 
sundown." According to tnat attitude, the 
work is translated into a crucible, a vessel 

- two-dimensional until 1963; then, as of 
1964, three-dimensional and architectural 

- in which are solidified the puffs and 
variations of natural and human energies 
surrounding the artist: these can be the 
figure of a prisoner, a leaf, or all the 
pigments bought during a year in Pisa. 
Unlike Dubuffet or Willem de Kooning, 
Merz is not trying to evoke the cruel or 
ironical enticement of landscapes and fe- 
male bodies; rather, he wants to produce 
upon the canvas a trail of chromatic lava,

which, in its process of thickening, speaks 
of fullnesses and voids, of lines and net- 
works, of visual diastoles and systoles, as 
registered in the course of a day by the 
seismograph/ artist. 

The resulting cartography is neither the 
fabulous and monstrous sensuality of a 
female body, again as in Dubuffet and de 
Kooning, nor the political tragedy of Fau- 
trier or the anguished signs of Francis 
Bacon; instead, we have a flow of utterly 
undiscriminated color: a tangle of existen- 
tial waves, in which Merz takes refuge - a 
habitat. When the latter becomes three- 
dimensional, the term for defining it is the 
igloo. 

A final element distinguishes Merz from the 
artists of Informel and Action Painting: the 
fusion of the body of the artifice with the 
canvas is never disrupted. The contact is 
given not by dry, nervous gestures, like a 
Fontana slash or a Pollock drip, but by 
linear actions that tend to remain intact (the 
hand never leaves the drawing), as if they 
were united by a natural destiny. For Merz, 
art is thus intensified life, it unrolls with the 
forces of existence. It is a "breath from 
below," to quote Antonin Artaud, 10 a 
breath in which are stratified the energy 
currents that activate the vital contexts. 
Merz populates space and occupies the 
vacuum, evincing a silence of thoughts and 
sensations; he accumulates signs in order to 
set off an explosion of their comptemporary 
and cohesive force. He works on the field 
of energy in order to form groups of 
meaning, which take in even the insane 
moments of life. He unites or assembles 
their unusual and contradictory directions, 
giving them an unforeseen and astonishing 
fixity, which defines the work of art. 

As of 1963: Crucibles of Earth and Light 

It was in terms of the growth of condensa- 
tion and solidification that the artist de- 
manded a growth from the canvas. In 1963, 
he concentrated a six-inch layer of pigments 
on the surface. The painting jutted out; but, 
having become a bark or a crust of earth, 
it developed cracks and fissures, foreshad- 
owing the clay igloo, which forms cracks 
upon drying. Merz thus had to abandon his 
system in order to make room for a different 
kind of jutting. He achieved this in 1964 
when he constructed the Untitled series: 
white or colored canvases or wicker on 



wood structures, from which shaped canva- 
ses jutted out in the form of a cube or 
truncated pyramid or roof-covered three- 
dimensional triangle. Of these "jutting 
forms," in white canvas or wicker two 
photographs remain; 11 they were taken in 
Merz's studio on via Santa Giulia, in Turin, 
which I had the good fortune to visit during 
that period. Vestiges of those paintings are 
extant, because the artist recycled them in 
later works: for example, Prehistoric Wind 
from the Frozen Mountains (Vento preistori- 
co dalle montagne gelate), 1965 + 78, paint- 
ed yellow and traversed by a neon tube; and 
Prehistoric Wind from the Frozen Moun- 
tains, 1966 + 79, its surface painted dark 
brown on one side and silver on the other, 
pierced by a neon tube and placed on a heap 
of twigs, with Fibonacci numbers. Done in 
both white and colder colors, such works 
must be regarded as painting /sculptures, 
halfway between the two media. Their roots 
obviously go back to Merz's Pisa canvas, 
except that these painting/sculptures 
evince a growth and organic development, 
taking the form of a structure or volume 
that juts out towards the viewer. Technical- 
ly, Merz executed these pieces by blocking 
a plane /surface on the ground and, with the 
help of steel clamps, 12 setting up regular or 
irregular stretchers covered with canvas or 
wicker. That same year, 1965, Merz exhibit- 
ed them along with paintings in order to 
make them easier to read and to clarify their 
artistic process: 

The works I made after everything else - the 
jutting structures - were determined by the 
presence of flat works. In the latter, the 
black sign, summary and flaking, functioned 
as a margin, and as such, it delimited the 
planes of the various colored surfaces, 
showing the need for further development. 
Thus, in dealing with the operative situation 
of form expanding into space, the flat 
paintings were like blueprints for works that 
are still to be carried out. 13 
The pictorial surface rises, forming a relief; 
it is experienced as a leap through space. 
Its rise indicates the pleasure of the fermen- 
tation that always activates creative energy, 
from dawn till dusk, and once again the next 
morning, and so on, from day to day. The 
sculpture, with its volume, thus surges from 
the painting, with its surface; and from this 
point on, it is impossible for Merz to 
separate them.

Cat. no. 22, On the Street 
(Nella strada). 1967 



Furthermore, the dilation of the painting in 
a convexity accentuates the impatient full- 
ness of its growth. By 1965, the wealth of 
sensations that were initially registered by 
the line and the color could no longer be 
contained; these sensations kept swelling 
and tended to seek an epidermic fullness 
that produced effervescences, which Merz 
fixed in truncated pyramids or jutting 
triangles. This process seems to reflect the 
attempt of the painting - a blind and 
illusory window on the world - to open its 
shutters and let the light through. 
Take Untitled, 1966, with its jutting shape, 
which is made of interwoven reeds: a 
fisherman's net basket, which has captured 
a neon tube, leans against the extreme end 
of the triangle formed by the shutters. In 
the Untitled series of 1965, which eventual- 
ly was inserted into pieces done during the 
1970s, the two lateral surfaces are painted 
with strips and stripes in such a way that 
the color glides from one to the next, both 
against and across it, thereby creating an 
effect that looks like rain, a natural phenom- 
enon, like color, as an instrument for 
registering the environment. Both compari- 
sons suggest a naturalistic reading of Mario 
Merz's art; but, as a closer inspection 
reveals, they are due to the subject matter, 
leaves and trees, that he used during the 
1950s. It would be more interesting to 
point out that the material and natural 
metaphor prefigures an organic link be- 
tween the Baroque discipline of a Borromi- 
ni and the modernist cosmology of a Gaudi. 
For Merz, as we have noted, the artwork 
crystallizes from a trajectory or a parabola: 
it is based on two points, in space and in 
time. "My forms," says Merz, "nave neither 
a before nor an after, even if each one of 
them is the history of what has been; 
moreover, in its potential for modification, 
each form is open to the future." 14 It results 
from a curve of the fall of the material, 
color, and so on, which produces an open 
design, as suggested by the movement. 
Here, space, as in the Baroque, is "that of 
travel, repetitiousness.... It dwells on the 
unusual, validates the ephemeral, threatens 
the perpetuity of order." 1 '' 
The reference to Baroque methods helps us 
to understand the emergence of a linguistic 
elipsis in Merz's work, with the two centers, 
painting and sculpture; it also enables us to 
anticipate the favoring of the unwonted 



decentralizing of things and elements (can- 
vas + neon + reeds + color, and so on) and 
to announce the dynamics of the circle, in 
the igloo, with its possibilities of elasticity 
and multiplication. 

But let us go back to Untitled, 1966, in 
which the elements reveal an energetic 
density, making it totally different from 
Merz's earlier pieces. Above all, we note 
that beyond the interweaving of the jutting 
structure, the wicker and the neon, this 
work has other peculiarities. The lateral 
surfaces have holes covered with scotch 
tape and revealing haloes that seem to 
indicate the use of fire. A similar physical 
and mental vertigo characterizes the instal- 
lation On the Street (Nella strada), 1967. 
The jutting form is no longer colored or 
made of wicker; now, it is a white and very 
tense canvas, ripped and traversed by a 
wavy neon line and framed above and below 
by metal bands. The osmosis between the 
parts is no longer based on the stratification 
of colors or the expansion of forms into 
space; it now derives from a transfer: the 
neon penetrates the volume, leaving rips on 
the surface and producing a strong energy 
contrast. 

Both pieces thus concretize the work of an 
assemblage; they combine different symbol- 
ic and metaphorical materials, various 
meanings, allowing different realities to 
coexist. Ultimately, they produce a new 
vortex, which gathers various products of 
Merz's artistic language. These are extreme- 
ly important balancing acts, confirming past 
motifs and introducing new values, partly 
in relation to artistic events that characterize 
Italy, especially Turin. 
We must now look at the visual and 
linguistic aspect of Merz's work. The en- 
counter of unities of discourse fusing into 
a whole that becomes a different object is 
part of the process of dislocation and 
disorientation triggered by the discourse of 
historical vanguards, from Dadaism to Sur- 
realism. Flouting the orthodoxy of the 
Weltanschauung, it favors an iconoclastic 
and marginal vision. Furthermore, the re- 
course to constructed things (the jutting 
forms, the neon lines) or found things (the 
fishing basket) expresses a shift towards 
surprise, but in a contrary way. Augmenting 
the strategy of assemblage and interweav- 
ing, the focus thus swings towards a new 
texture of reality, bringing forth a different

sensibility, which is based on new relation- 
ships. The dynamism thereby obtained 
moves other meanings, which are based on 
the metamorphoses of things, changes and 
identities. The resulting effect is that of a 
semantic instability of substances and ele- 
ments, as if plural meanings, shifts and 
performances in perpetual motion opened 
up before each object. The work becomes 
an active site of encounter, a metaphor for 
the conjunction of and penetration by signs, 
the birthplace of something new. 
But in which direction does the crisscross- 
ing of Merz's signs achieve its configura- 
tion? What is its cradle? How is it different 
from the Neo-Dada and Pop ensembles that 
circulated during the 1960s? The answers 
lie in the before and after of an Italian 
henomenon: as of 1963, Turin saw the 
aunchings of new information enterprises, 
such as Gian Enzo Sperone's Galleria II 
Punto. While the Galleria Civica d'Arte 
Moderna had presented major retrospec- 
tives of the works of Franz Kline and Bacon 
in 1962 and 1963, these new galleries added 
Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert 
Rauschenberg, Jim Dine and James Rosen- 
quist to the artistic panorama experienced 
by Merz. The triumph of these artists in 
Italy was due to the Venice Biennale of 
1964, which awarded its first prize to 
Rauschenberg. Along with them, articles on 
Minimalism in Artforum and Art News 
helped to bring an international context to 
the Turin art world. For decades Turin had 
mediated between Italy and France, concre- 
tizing its activities in exhibitions and cultur- 
al centers, such as Michel Tapie's Centre de 
Recherche Estetique in Turin. But now the 
Turinese focus shifted from Paris to New 
York. In this way, the dialogue highlighted 
a scene that was shared by or imbued with 
both Poo and Minimalism, yet conscious of 
possessing an inalienable European identity 
that was irreconcilable with any other. 
The year 1966 marked the debut of Arte 
Povera, the theory of which was defined in 
1967, with a search for continuous meta- 
morphoses of languages, accompanied by a 
transmutation and proliferation that are 
different from any forms. The goal was to 
deviate from the absolutism of mass-media 
icons, those of popular culture, and to 
challenge in order to shatter the abstract and 
linear images of industrial, reductive and 
Minimalist perfection. Basically, this new 



movement opposed a monolithic culture 
that excludes ambiguity and confusion, 
explosion and deconstruction, irresponsi- 
bility and material chaos, with all the 
psycho-physical reversals that these terms 
imply. The essence of this shift was the 
scattering of a potential of figures and 
images that could circulate in all directions, 
with no apparent coherence, aside from the 
iconoclasm of incoherence, as a method of 
working and creating. 
The dissemination commenced in Turin 
during 1966 and 1967. In the course of one 
year, the Gian Enzo Sperone, Christian 
Stein and Notizie galleries held solo exhibi- 
tions of the work of Michelangelo Pistolet- 
to, Pino Pascali, Alighiero Boetti, Luciano 
Fabro, Marisa Merz, Giulio Paolini and 
Gilberto Zorio, and group shows including 
the same artists as well as Mario Merz and 
Jannis Kounellis. 16 

In 1966, Mario Merz began responding and 
contributing to this new linguistic climate, 
with the concrete presence of the above- 
mentioned ensembles, such as Untitled, 
1966, and On the Street, 1967. Their 
fullness was intensified not only by the 
interweaving of discordant entities, but also 
by the addition of a concrete subject - light 
in the guise of neon, as a disruptive energy. 
The theme of light, say fire or a radiant 
substance, iconographically present in 
Merz's The Welder, 1956, was a common 
legacy of Italian artists from Futurism to 
Spatialism. But it was only with Fontana's 
Structure for the Ninth Milan Triennial, 
1961, that neon, with its coldness, entered 
the art system, to be followed in 1963 by 
Dan Flavin's gold fluorescent tube. These 
two artists defined a different use of light 
as subject matter. 

In 1949, Fontana, following the premises 
of Giacomo Balla and Umberto Boccioni, 
introduced light as a new device, in Spatial 
Environment; akin to the cut or the hole 
in the canvas, light helped to create a space 
or route of maximum flexibility. It is a 
fluctuating substance, unlimited, unbound- 
ed, which the artist, with a gesture, uses to 
cross the environment. It therefore aimed 
at upsetting the pictorial space, turning it 
into a traversable phenomenon. However, 
Flavin's statements refer to the tautological 
value of light as an icon, an "anonymous 
and inglorious" entity, presented by means 
of fluorescent tubes, their monochromes

Cat. no. 20, Horse Theater 
(Teatro cavallo). 1967 



ranging from gold to pink, from cool white 
to red and blue. They are technological 
totems, virtually endless columns {Gold 
Diagonal was initially dedicated to Constan- 
tin Brancusi, hence to his Endless Column), 
which, consistent with Marshall McLu- 
han's theory, are paeans to the discovery of 
light as pure information. 
For Merz, in contrast, light is a fire, creating 
combustions, altering the composition of 
the elements, producing tensions by pier- 
cing and ripping. Moreover, according to 
the natural symbolism accompanying it, 
light/ fire renews the alchemy of the parts, 
to become an instrument of penetrating 
knowledge (in 1972, the Fibonacci numbers 
were written in neon) and a motor of 
periodic regeneration. On the other hand, 
it is also a vehicle, putting the parts in 
contact with each other, uniting them, 
suggesting new totalities. 
The summary nature of two discordant 
entities was confirmed in another Untitled, 
1966, which I saw in Merz's studio on via 
Santa Giulia. This piece consisted of two 
jutting shapes on triangular bases; made of 
wicker, they were placed near one another, 
thus constituting a sequence, both of them 
linked by a horizontal neon tube, which 
pierced one shape, the space between them, 
and then the second shape. Aside from 
aligning the objects and making them 
visually compact (fire is an alchemical 
coniunctio accompanying all processes of 
modification of material), light has a pictori- 
al character, altering the colors of things: 
The neon, which casts its violent light on 
the canvas shapes, also has a sense of 
violence, which alters the very colors of the 
materials of paintings. It is not the problem 
of color per se that interests me, even though 
the neon changes the colors of various 
materials without transposing the image, 
which is what happens in paintings. 1 ' 
Fascination with light is always evoked by 
a concrete and material anti-illusionist vi- 
sion. It releases a true gaze by revealing the 
resources of the materials and their perfor- 
mance. It strikes the surfaces and activates 
them, qualifying their essentiality, giving 
them life, naming them, and thereby turning 
them into writing. {Objet cache-toi, Si tin 
and Solitary Solidarity [Solitario solidale] 
were done in 1968, one year after On the 
Street.) 
If the principal goal is to interweave 



multiplicity in order to release its wander- 
ing energy, Merz's 1968 show at the 
Galleria Gian Enzo Sperone, Turin, re- 
vealed the vast breath of the artist's new 
course in relation to objects. He exhibited 
works dated 1966 and 1967; two of them, 
Horse Theater (Teatro cavallo) and Hamper 
(Cestone) contained jutting forms, while 
others, Carrier Cone (Conoportante), Lance 
(Lancia) and Untitled, involving bottles and 
neon, did without them completely. The use 
of the word "theater" makes Horse Theater 
a presage of a future evolution that will 
introduce a continuous variability and mu- 
tation into the movements of the actors, that 
is, the components of a work. Nevertheless, 
those features associated with the word 
"horse" retain something animal-like, 
something natural: a feeling that anchors 
them to an uncontrolled vital sensibility. In 
addition, the word "theater" also implies 
the directorial role of the artist, who is 
called upon to prearrange an activity that 
celebrates energy and movement, images 
and performances. The ensemble is formed 
by a pillow painted red (in other versions, 
it either is white or disappears altogether), 
an uncovered iron structure (recalling the 
jutting forms of the paintings of 1966-67) 
and two neon lights, a wavy tube on the 
wall and a linear one on the structure. 
The materialization of a whole, producing 
a "theater," inspired Merz to look for a 
"dramatization" that would open variants 
to the kaleidoscope of combinations and 
grafts on the wall. The "performers" dem- 
onstrated agility and movement, dropping 
down and propping themselves on the 
floor. They practiced a relationship with the 
totality of the environment, crossing it 
without becoming entrenched. "In my 
opinion," says Merz, "art is the only thing 
that allows us to get through things and to 
be a process of traversing rather than an 
arrival. " lx Horse Theater thus unhooks the 
work from the wall and defines an inde- 
pendent space that has removed the canvas, 
nence the genre of painting, from the jutting 
structure, and that tries to put greater 
emphasis on the encounter of figures of 
neon light and the figures of the everyday 
object, the pillow. 

Indeed, that same exhibition included Unti- 
tled, 1967, which consists of a bottle 
leaning against a plexiglass cube and 
pierced by a neon tube. This complex object

Collection of the artist 



is part of a series of 1967 installations in 
which neon joined forces with an umbrella, 
a glass ana a bottle, a raincoat and a 
chamber pot. These pieces are blocks, 
which, by suggesting a different system of 
associating things, draws different mean- 
ings from them. 

Top priority was still given to the continui- 
ty of energy, already present in the paintings 
done in 1953: "I think that in nature, the 
elements all crisscross one another." 19 Al- 
most as important was the theme of light- 
ning, which electrifies things, placing them 
in a field of different energy. However, 
lightning also transfixes; it resembles a 
Lance, 1967, penetrating bodies and modi- 
fying them internally. 
A further meaning originates in the encoun- 
ter of two registers: the object and the neon 
light. They have to yield the meaning that 
is theater and the representation of a 
coupling in which each loses and gains 
identity. Everything moves along a line of 
dialectics: on the one side, marginal objects 
tied to an organic and corporealfunctionali- 
tv, which speaks of drinking, urinating, 
dressing, getting soaked by rain - in sum, 
living in a daily and common rhythm; and 
on the other side, the cold, technological 
abstraction of light, an instrument for 
exploring the dark, a scientific and sacred 
device. Both possess ample virtualities of 
signification between conscious and uncon- 
scious, material and immaterial, being and 
nonbeing - the legacy of an ambiguity 
sought by historical vanguards from Pablo 
Picasso to Marcel Duchamp, from Kurt 
Schwitters to Salvador Dali. 
However, as we can note, Merz does not 
pick a strange and unusual object, selected 
for its exotic character or industrial force; 
he prefers objects found at home or in a 
corner to those coming from somewhere 
else. He circulates his everyday devices, 
such as his raincoat, then his car, as aids 
for living. Indeed, as in his drawings of 
1945 to 1949, he is always the center and 
fulcrum of aggregation and sensory elabora- 
tion in an external stage decoration: the 
spectacle arises from the trajectories traced 
by his objects. 

Ultimately, in this network of associations, 
the object and the neon light are invested 
with a flurry of meanings that make them 
oscillate between dream and reality, paint- 
ing and sculpture, libido and concept. 



...for instance, the empty wine bottle trav- 
ersed by neon. It was something of an 
invention - that emerging spurt of wine 
represented by light, instead of painting. 
Rather than painting that spurt, I empha- 
sized the effect of explosion and flight. It 
became very sensual, but also nonsensual, 
because it was reduced to a line. 20 
At times, either the neon, or the tip of the 
lance, or the bottle is covered with red 
pigment. For Merz, sculptures always re- 
main paintings, but his colors continue to 
evoke a mobile and active vital force. Red 
recalls fire, coursing blood and wine. It 
again implies the process of modification 
and generation, inciting to action and warm- 
ing up the interiors of bodies. It is also a 
symbol of warrior ability as well as passion 
and sensuality. 

In Raincoat (Impermeabile), 1961, the two 
intersecting neon tubes that perforate the 
raincoat (which Merz discarded after using 
it) were covered with touches of red pig- 
ment. They thus evince the artist's inner 
force and energy as well as his explosion 
on the outside. This is an artist who 
identifies himself in the artwork as his 
habitation and habitat, the raincoat, but 
who is ready to leave it or set it aside, like 
a nomad, in order to reach new things. The 
force of this raincoat is poised disquietingly 
for all of Merz's creative activity so far. It 
is his shadow and his imprint. If he left it 
behind, he would be virtually removing his 
gaze from the territory of his body, in order 
to ignore its temporal course. The raincoat 
thus becomes a presence, dropping from 
period to period into the work, emphasizing 
the artist's mobile body, which leaves 
enigmatic clues in space. A neat, meticulous 
reflected image emerges in 1972, 1979, 
1981, up to the recent Turbine (Turbina), 
1988, displaying the estrangement that 
grazes the artist when he tries to manifest 
the place of his experience: the body of life. 
The raincoat is the echo of this body, which 
is reborn and finds itself again, made 
recognizable because it is still traversed by 
energy: the light that is a continuous 
awakening and illumination. 
Merz's view differs from that of Bruce 
Nauman. Both began using neon in 1966, 
but with diverse goals. The California artist 
thinks in terms of decorative culture, he 
refers to advertising slogans and the city- 
scape filled with luminous writings. He

listens to Las Vegas as a place of energy and 
attempts a poetic response, which places the 
artist at trie center; his statements and 
writing which relate to the street signs and 
street advertisements: 21 The True Artist 
Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truth, 
1967, designed for a window or a wall sign, 
or else for an extraterrestrial slogan that 
exalts the artist himself, in My Name as 
Though It Were Written on the Surface of 
the Moon, 1968. Thus, neon is utilized as 
a potency for information and publicity, 
able to accept any and all messages. Rather 
than accelerating the energy, neon cools it 
down, triggering an implosion of meaning, 
producing an evanescence of the medium 
itself for a circularity of the artist's lyrical 
and poetic thought. Nauman works on his 
transformism, opting for a writing that, in 
a world of nonexistence, such as advertis- 
ing, reintroduces the corporal existence of 
an artistic being. This is the very opposite 
of Merz, who uses that being in order to 
transcend the distinction between a world 
of shadow and a world of substance so as 
to join them together and unite them. 
Hence, it is not employed as a phantom or 
absence, but as a gestural and vital presence 
(the course always seems free and subordi- 
nate to the gesture of the hand, as in a 
drawing); it injects an erotic component, a 
passage between various bodies with differ- 
ent sensualities. It is something in between, 
an intermediary that unites and provokes 
a libidinal spark, a pleasure that passes 
through the individual subjectivity. That is 
why Merz's neon is put to an amorous use, 
conquering or conquered. It is both ephem- 
eral and solid. It fuses grace and strength, 
fatness and skinniness, satisfying all experi- 
ences. It guarantees the circulation of plea- 
sure between lovers, because it makes the 
boiling of sensual energy pass from one 
body to the other. 

The Gentle Movement of the Igloos 

This is the same boiling found under 
Hamper, 1967, shown in Amalfi for the 
exhibition Arte povera + Azioni povere: a 
pot of water boiling under a cut cone of 
wicker. Akin to light, water runs; hence, it 
recurs in Merz's oeuvre as in What's To Be 
Done? (Che fare?), 1969, shown at L'Attico 
in Rome, and The Drop of Water (La goccia 
d'acqua), 1987, shown in Bordeaux. Water, 
here, symbolizes regeneration, raw materi- 



al, vitality, incessant movement. Side by 
side with neon /fire, it creates a sharp 
polarity, a contrast, thereby producing yet 
another fertile pair. However, it was also 
a political boiling in 1968 that disrupted 
civil society, triggering a crisis in behaviors 
and languages, in attitudes towards power 
and the family, and inflicting a deep wound 
on a static society, making it mobile and 
filling it with conflict. That was the year in 
which the old social contradictions fused 
with the revolt against the authoritarian 
power of one generation over another. The 
year 1968 brought the explosive rejection 
of a philistine culture, which failed to 
recognize the "other" - from the female to 
the homosexual. This phenomenon, leaving 
its imprint on all cultural models, had a 
worldwide diffusion. People spoke of a 
revolutionary imagination, an image of 
power and a universal renewal. The refer- 
ences were to all languages, so that art, too, 
was affected, undergoing a tremendous but 
. salutary shock. It opened up to multiplicity, 
no longer categorizing itself as painting or 
sculpture; it went into the streets and into 
the deserts, calling its adventures Arte 
Povera, Land Art, Body Art, Conceptual 
Art. It was a period of feverish experimen- 
tation, which liberalized the creative 
processes. 

Merz, too, experienced the abundance of 
that time and, as a good seismograph, he 
registered the situation, integrating it in his 
work, for example, in Sitin, 1968, and 
Solitary Solidarity, both 1968 - titles deriv- 
ing directly from actions, events and graffiti 
of the May uprising in France. 
The meaning was politico-existential, the 
writings were inserted on a wax stratum, 
which filled up, or a net or in a pot. That 
is why they were the nutriments, both 
intellectual and physical, of a society as well 
as an individual. At the same time, the 
writing, when placed upon the object, 
dominated it, tried to make it disappear. It 
was almost as if the idea and the Utopia, the 
project and the dream, written but not 
experienced, betrayed sensitivity and delica- 
cy. Merz's reading was meticulous: illusion 
crumbled, because it was mental, cerebral, 
and not experienced; it remained an Unreal 
City (Cittd irreale), 1968. 
Still, we are left with the awareness that the 
idea or the written commitment can annul 
the world, so that words replace reality,

occupying it until it ultimately disappears. 
Merz feels the danger of opening art to the 
dominion of the thinker and the ideologue, 
which was emphasized by the arrival of 
Conceptual Art on the visual scene. Merz 
reacted by minimizing the efficacy of the 
idea qua word, which could easily devour 
the object, and by constructing a real world: 
the gallery. 

/ made the igloo for three overlapping 
reasons. First in order discard the jutting 
plane or wall plane and create a space 
independent of the process of hanging things 
on the wall or nailing them to the wall and 
putting them on a table. Hence, the idea of 
the igloo as the idea of absolute and 
self-contained space: it is not modeled; it is 
a hemisphere placed on the ground. I wanted, 
the hemisphere to be nongeometrical, so the 
hemispherical shape created by a metallic 
structure was covered with sacks or shape- 
less pieces of material such as soil, clay or 
glass. Then I began the work of writing on 
this structure. I felt it was so important to 
be able to write in an absolutely static form 
like neon. 22 

Linkable to the cabins and domes of 
primitive and historical structures, the ig- 
loo 2 ' reveals the essential function of de- 
limiting a territory or an environment 
between inner space and outer space. It 
works with limits, such as the perimeter of 
a painting, marking the boundary between 
full and empty. It is a magnet, accumulating 
tensions and weights, thoughts and ges- 
tures, whose osmosis is energetically de- 
fined with the breath of the circumference, 
which, being elastic, vibrates under the 
pressures of clay or glass. As a den and a 
cathedral of survival, shielding against 
winds and artistic stress, the igloo is the 
image of the nomad and the vagabond, who 
believes not so much in a secure object as 
in a dynamic and contradictory existence. 
As we have already emphasized in regard 
to Merz's works of the 1905s: for the 
nomad, existence means moving in a con- 
text and reinventing for oneself an osmosis 
with food and nature, landscape and local 
people, without crystallizing as anything 
definite or stable. By the same token, his 
structures are not likely to endure; rather, 
they emerge from the accumulation of items 
necessary for his survival. Merz, a nomad 
in painting, became a builder of igloos: 
You have to construct in a way that is 



antithetical to present-day models. Con- 
struct with processes of development and 
withdrawal, by deploying willpower and 
subduing will power, in a natural breath, 
day and night. The materials are chosen 
from one time to the next, dictated by fate, 
by the location, by the adjacency of other 
elements, by the plants.... Constructing is an 
hour-by-hour and day-by-day need to fuse 
your will with everything that is dispersive 
in life. 2A 

Accordingly, construction becomes an inter- 
pretation and humanization of territories; 
it is no longer felt as a place of passage and 
parking, but as a field of sensibilities. The 
erection of the igloo thus responds to 
personal and social needs, while remaining 
open to symbolic and cosmic interpreta- 
tions. The dimension of the igloo is mythi- 
cal and moves through time, which is why 
its re-creation preserves the engima of an 
active but spent life. Thus, the clamps and 
arches forming its bark or defensive crust 
can bear painted glass and mats, bite and 
fix canvases and twigs, gather stone slabs 
and glass, car doors and wax surfaces. 
Everything is reduced to the enigma and 
magma of nomadic energy, in which signs 
form images that combine miserable yet 
vital and present materials. 
The earliest igloos, Objet cache-toi and 
Giap Igloo (Igloo di Gap) were made in 
1968 and were installed that same year at 
the Deposito d'Arte Presente, Turin. Giap 
Igloo bore the sentence "Se il nemico si 
concentra perde terreno, se si disperde perde 
forza" (If the enemy masses his forces, he 
loses ground; if he scatters he loses 
strength). The first igloo was a semicircular 
structure bearing a net on which Merz had 
placed lumps of clay that eventually dried; 
the words "objet cache-toi" (object, conceal 
yourself) were written on the clay. The 
second igloo was made of lumps of clay held 
together by cellophane bearing the Giap 
script. In the system of political and sensory 
hopes created that year, 1968, the mutual 
support between the affirmation of a closed 
and compact hemispherical world, the meta- 
phor for an individual habitat, and the 
assumption of a collective consciousness by 
means of the harmony of writing demon- 
strated that, for Merz, art has never been 
a happy island, an art for art's sake that does 
not participate even minimally in the histor- 
ical parabola; rather, it is a speaking and

acting, the responsible occupation of space 
that does not indicate the risk and danger 
typical of strategy. Giap, a Vietnamese 
general, and the artist, both of whom think 
of mounting an attack on all the structures 
of political or visual oppression, not simply 
in terms of violence, but in terms of force 
in a dialectical relationship with the enemy 
and the context. 

As a place of salvation and energetic 
declaration, the igloo is a pure testimony 
to trust amid insecurity. Merz regards the 
artist's destiny as an essentially anarchic 
enterprise, which rejects any kind of author- 
ity or set of rules, proliferating where there 
is no security. It is a way of life and thought, 
it can proceed lightly and swiftly, it is a 
double skin that shields the artist's ideal 
body. 

The igloo is the ideal organic shape. It is 
both a world and a small house. What 
interests me in the igloo is that it exists in 
the mind prior to being implemented: an 
organic idea is not yet organic in the 
absolute; it first has to be realized. Next 
comes the problem of organizing a structure 
that is as simple as possible. Architecture is 
a construction for refuge, for giving human 
beings a total dimension.... The igloo is a 
synthesis, a complex image, since I thorough- 
ly torment the elementary image of an igloo, 
which I carry inside my self. - % 
Merz manages to define the dwelling-less 
place that gives rise to the solitary con- 
sciousness of a unique and complex self- 
expression that is not tied to any norms 
aside from that of a process of growth and 
grafting on the root stock of the cultural 
plant; in so doing, Merz lends lightness and 
clarity to that cultural plant. In Never Has 
Stone Been Raised on Stone (Mai alzato 
pietra su pietra), 1968, the lumps of clay are 
replaced by lumps of cloth, while the 
writing places art outside the realm of 
brutal physical work, transforming art into 
a delicate, sensual activity with a strong 
female component; after all, the idea of the 
lumps came from Marisa Merz, whose 

Eresence henceforth fundamentally marked 
er husband's oeuvre. 
If indeed the igloo is a starting point for 
fantastic and energetic radiation as well as 
self-absorption, its image can magnetize all 
sensibilities. It repels gazes in order to 
defend itself, but takes them in for a 
dialogue, turning opaque or transparent, 



rigid or dry, covering itself with glass and 
twigs, delicate and frail when clad in wax 
or canvas, defensive and aggressive when 
coated with broken glass. Hence, the igloo 
is an open entity, which accepts the fact that 
inside and outside are one and the same, just 
like love and hate, friendship and enmity. 
The dialectics introduced into Merz's first 
drawing ultimately became architecture, a 
habitable vessel, functioning as the same 
alembic of sensations and experiences; it is 
a cup (an upside-down cup) that gathers the 
dust of its wanderings upon its shell. 
The igloo is a subject devoted to a relation- 
ship with architecture and landscape. It 
gathers a place and a time, but since it does 
not put them in order, it is drawn to chance 
and disorder. It works on blendings and it 
shatters the habitual configurations of Car- 
tesian thought, because it brings out unfore- 
seen articulations. It is a passerby, living the 
rhythm of the city and its chaos. Its 
existence is made up of vestiges and frag- 
ments, and it never admits the phenomeno- 
logical rigor of Minimalist objectivity. The 
greater attention paid by Merz to his 
environmental situation is thus not free of 
sensorial effluvia, it touches the world in 
its flesh and bone. The igloo is an experi- 
enced scrap. 

In opposition to the rigorous enunciation 
of Minimalism, the igloo establishes a 
gnoseological and mental contact with 
space and architecture, devoid of smudges 
and imprecisions. During those same years, 
the sculptures of Donald Judd and Carl 
Andre, the environments of Sol LeWitt and 
Flavin resisted any interference. They cul- 
minated in pure signs and volumes, imbued 
with an absolute industrial and geometric 
sublimation. Minimalism followed a phe- 
nomenological doctrine, describing, as it 
did, constructive modalities and the proce- 
dures of appearances. It purified the results 
of art, reducing them to their formal 
essentiality, relating them to their primary 
generality. The study of such eidetic phe- 
nomena leads to an awareness of artistic 
method and process, but reduces them to 
sheer appearance, thereby almost eliminat- 
ing the difference between shadow and 



substance. 

Merz secures himself against that risk, 
utilizing a primary form (the sphere), but 
not relying on its metaphysical purity or its 
conceptuality. He loads it with the imprints

of a precarious and delirious truth, trans- 
forming it into concrete but also enigmatic 
knowledge. For the Italian artist, the notion 
and phenomenon of a form, its logic and 
conceptuality are momentary factors. To- 
gether with Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust, 
authors whom Merz read as a teenager, he 
believes that evanescent and ephemeral data 
guarantee a greater intensity. Thus, he 
opposes the maximum topographical preci- 
sion of Minimalism with a maximum open- 
ness to the accidents and randomness of a 
trip through the things of everyday life and 
nature. 

In 1969, an utterly frail and dissonant 
location was offered by the Galleria L'Atti- 
co in Rome, where Merz exhibited pieces 
involving glass, twigs, wax and stucco. 
Each work participated in the unique 
environment: an ola garage revamped into 
a gallery, where Kounellis nad presented his 
live horses. In this space, Merz installed ten 
pieces, including: Wood Shavings (Truccio- 
ti), 1967-69, a bale of hay with a neon tube; 
Small Parcel (II paccbetto), 1969, a se- 
quence of dusty panes illuminated from 
behind; Nugget (Lingotto), 1969, a truncat- 
ed pyramidal structure surrounded by 
twigs, its peak occupied by a block of wax; 
and Automobile Pierced by Neon (Auto- 
mobile trapassata dal neon), 1969, a gray 
Simca 1000, with a Swiss license plate, 
which, after being driven by Merz for years, 
wound up as an artwork (like the raincoat), 
with a neon tube stuck into its roof. 
Compared with the previous show in Turin, 
the images displayed in Rome tended to- 
wards liquefaction, moving from the trans- 
parency of glass to the frailty of stucco and 
wax. In their thrust towards a dissipation 
of the object, these works introduced nets 
and twigs, hay and bamboo, and brought 
back water What's To Be Done), while 
presenting the constant leitmotif of the 
nomad, this time in the avator of a car. The 
effect was that of a discharge into a bright, 
windy, airborne landscape of leaves and 
shrubs. These were floating transparent 
entities, which, nevertheless, formed a terri- 
tory, whose memory quivered with rural 
poetry, that of Italy and the Piedmont, as 
described by Cesare Pavese. 
The calm presence of the twigs running 
under The Bridge (II ponte) of bamboo and 
glass formed a throng that surrounded the 
wax nest in Nugget, introducing a subse- 



quent naturalistic metaphor for the course 
of life as well as the flow of the seasons. 
The latter affirmed the value of transience, 
the eternal return of a beauty of absolute 
temporality. 

The awareness of finding an irrevocable 
presence in the frailty and ephemeralness 
of the elements helps Merz to display the 
strength that thereby becomes transparent 
rather than defending itself from behind the 
shield of an idea or writing. The clay igloo 
with a neon sentence yields to Untitled, 
1969, the igloo of plaster, twigs and broken 
glass, likewise shown at L'Attico: 
When I made it [the igloo] of soil, I put a 
neon tube on it, but I added nothing to the 
glass igloo, because it was utterly clear, it 
is simply a problem of transparency: the fact 
that inside and outside are one and the 
same. 2b 

In becoming transparent, the igloo became 
penetrable, revealing its availability and its 
courageous willingness to expose its interi- 
or, while maintaining its hazardous nature 
in the glass shards, which the artist sees as 
kindred energies: "Broken glass is like a 
friend for me, not an enemy or stranger." 27 
The exaltation of the transience of twigs and 
the opacity of glass, with jagged, broken 
outlines, speak of a time that wanes slowlv, 
striving to make a way for itself, like lignt 
through glass: 

The exhibition also included glass that I had 
found at a glazier 's place. Those panes were 
covered with dust, and I coated them with 
plaster which made them very heavy, in 
contrast with the idea of glass, which is light 
and transparent. The light set up behind that 
group of panes was mellowed and, at the 
same time, it became very distant.... It had 
to make a tremendous effort to get out. 78 
Each element enhances the value of the 
existential and natural limit, rejecting the 
immense machine of industry with its 
metaphysical notion of progress. 
Thus, there is no room for a concept of 
eternity and fixity; like the glass panes and 
fragments, the elements merely lean: leaning 
signifies rising and depositing with the 
notion of retaking. Those are the three 
irrevocable factors in Merz's oeuvre, which 
continually rises, deposits and reclaims its 
ensembles in order to install them else- 
where. It makes no difference if during this 
interesting and adventurous movement, the 
materials, such as glass, stucco, twigs, rocks

and so on, adapted to a specific moment and 
context, are dispersed or even destroyed 
- such is their fate. They will be replaced 
by others, equally precarious, which will be 
sacrificed to a new igloo, that is the same 
as or similar to the preceding one. For Merz, 
each construction is equivalent to another, 
because it lives the life of a branch, flowers 
and dries out, is lopped off, but is then 
reborn. Thus, it reemerges in a different 
form, with the same sap, and it can 
ultimately create a forest, like the forest 
made up of dozens of igloos at the Kunst- 
haus Zurich in 1985. 
What's To Be Done?; also shown at L'Atti- 
co, Rome, in 1969, was a plaster sentence 
attached to the wall over an open faucet, 
from which water ran continuously. Those 
words come from "What's To Be Done?," 
a speech given by Lenin in 1912; however, 
their artistic import touches on their roots 
in the infinity or an unstoppable mutational 
process like the running of water: 
This water faucet must have as its value the 
importance of the water, which runs out in 
relation to the sentence "What's to be 
done?, " two things that are again in mutual 
suspension. For me, "What's to be done?" 
means: What is really to be done, in a 
meaning that is not directly significant, but 
probably that of the water. I did What's To 
Be Done? two times, once in Rome and once 
in Amsterdam, in March 1969, at the 
Stedelijk Museum, where, using a blend of 
earth and oil, I wrote out "WHAT'S TO 
BE DONE?" in gigantic letters. This piece 
was shown together with Unreal City, 1968, 
which was very close to Never Has Stone 
Been Raised on Stone, 1968, which means: 
my unreal city, our cities are unreal, sus- 
pended in the void. 29 
After Rome and Amsterdam, in the summer 
of 1969, Merz went to San Benedetto del 
Tronto, to execute Traces (Tracce), a se- 
quence of seagull footprints carved out in 
the inner wall of a building, leaving a trail 
from the floor to the window: 
In San Benedetto del Tronto, I was walking 
along the beach when I saw the footprints 
left by gulls with three toes. I copied those 
footprints on the wall, using a hammer and 
chisel- a trail running up from the floor and 
going out the window.™ 
Merz continued his experiments with the 
infinity of a "walking towards"; the follow- 
ing year, when he first started using the 



Fibonacci series, he did progessive numbers 
that could individuate an organic infinity. 
He still had to develop the animal subject, 
already present in Horse Theater, 1967, and 
then recurring during the 1970s. The use 
of animal symbolism involved the represen- 
tation of a primitive and archaic mentality 
rooted in the depths of the unconscious. In 
Traces, it is purely a metaphor for the 
artist /painter, whose light tread across the 
sand or wall can leave indelible and almost 
countable traces, like the toes of a seagull. 

The Organic Numbers 

Primitive tribes do not have the concept of 
number, which is too abstract for them. 
Rather, a number is perceived - heard, seen, 
smelled - like a sound, a color, a smell; it 
is an aspect of matter. At most, such people 
have an awareness of quantity, based on 
aligning an image, so that the meaning of 
"forest" is communicated by a repetition of 
the tree figure, "crowd" by the repetition 
of the human figure, and so forth." It is 
quite simply a matter of counting. Traces 
in San Benedetto del Tronto was a trail of 
footprints, scanning a quantity and an 
intensity. This thythm was repeated in 
Bologna in 1970, on the occasion of the 
exhibition Gennaio 70 at the Museo Civico, 
in the alignment piece Propped (Appoggiati), 
1970, a sequence of glass panes perforated 
by a line of neon tubes and leaning against 
a wall. Each unit is assigned a place in the 
natural series of groupings, whereby each 
pane becomes an ordinal number, which 
Merz writes in white on the glass; but, 
eschewing the normal sequence, 1,2,3,4, 
5,6,7,8,9, he follows the Fibonacci series. 
Fibonacci was the nickname of the medieval 
Italian mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, 
who wrote Liber abaci, (1202, republished 
in 1228). The series he devised is both 
vegetable and biological, since the numbers 
virtually constitute sets of parents who give 
birth to the following children: 0,1,1,2,3, 
5,8,13,21,34,55,89, 144.... This series can 
be used to calculate the offspring produced 
by a pair of rabbits within one year; the 
couples bear according to the Fibonacci 
series. 

Merz's glass panes in Bologna add up to 
thirteen, and the sequence runs to 144; but 
their proliferation subsequently continues 
in New York, at the auxiliary space of the 
Sonnabend Gallery, and at the Kunstmu-

seum in Lucerne, thereby becoming a se- 
quence of sequences: 

/ did this work because it corresponds with 
the proliferations of the natural and corporal 
elements; for instance, we have a nose, two 
eyes, five fingers, etc. This series is biologi- 
cally conceivable; hence, the work has a 
direction and real roots. This series is not 
a mere fantasy; it is used in computers, by 
mathematicians and architects; so I thought 
it would be possible to create relationships 
with it; I made continuously transportable 
signs that contain it and assume it. 32 
With the possibility of the Fibonacci nu- 
meric writing, Merz individuates the possi- 
ble organic limit of an infinite voyage. He 
manages to give that limit a hardness and 
solidity akin to the lines or colors of his 
earliest paintings or the stratification in his 
Pisa painting. He presents "something" 
that is not a conceptual or theoretical 
abstraction. (Merz sympathizes with this 
conceptualism, but does not feel it, he 
assigns it a weight and a physical relation- 
ship, between vegetable and animal, with 
reality). For this reason, even the numbers, 
like Merz's panes of glass, lean on the 
ground, the wall or the ceiling; they are 
always anchored to the architecture. All 
they can do, as natural instruments, is to 
creep, like shrubs and leaves, along the solid 
surfaces of any edifice. They transform it 
into a trunk with thousands of branches and 
twigs, on which, quite naturally, we also 
find animals: in 1971, at the John Weber 
Gallery, New York, the sequence of num- 
bers on the wall was led by an iguana. 
In Merz's hands, the flexibility of creeping 
numbers offers a fiber for weaving and 
sewing together the fragments of the world. 
This thread infiltrates newspapers and 
glass, tables and walls, objects and paint- 
ings, rooms and stairways, galleries and 
museums. Tying them together, it integrates 
them in its warp and woof, an artistic 
texture. Like animal semen, it is a fecund 
sap, giving birth to new beings. 
In relation to the history of art, it is a linear 
energy, similar to the Gothic and to Art 
Nouveau, which imposes its vegetable laws 
on buildings. Moreover, this fiber /sap/ 
vine /number is the pivot of a naturalist 
cosmogony that contains references to Lu- 
cretius and Virgil, to Leonardo da Vinci and 
Caravaggio. The growth of numbers forms 
a net for capturing the landscape. We must 



bear in mind that light is also a lance, and 
that the artist is a nomad warrior, for whom 
assault is consistent with their character- 
istics. 

In 1972, Merz was given his first chance 
to do an installation at an American muse- 
um, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, 
which enabled him to approach the world 
by means of an assault, an attack, from the 
base of the museum. 

The strategies of sensorial occupation took 
off from The Key of the Fibonacci Series, 
that is, the number sequence 1,1,2,3,5, and 
continued with that environment of Func- 
tion of Fibonacci from 8 to 28,657. The 
numbers ran up the stairs, marking the 
doors and elevator shafts, forming the 
Proliferation of Fibonacci Numbers from 1 
to 377 , following an iguana on the wall, 
settling on a cloth igloo 1+1=2, and 
accompanying a procession of newspaper 
bundles aligned on the floor and alternating 
with glass. The title of this last work is 
Proliferation of the Positions of Newspapers 
on the Floor from 8 to 144, because 8 was 
the next number in the sequence, and it 
followed the seventh and last step in the 
stairway. 

No architecture succeeds in forming an 
incursion of numbers, creating an empty 
space around them in order to leave the 
central space to the igloo and the periphery 
to the iguana and the newspapers. Both 
signs, the igloos and the newspapers, inter- 
est Merz because of their extreme position 
in the communication system: one suggests 
a wordless motion devoted to hearing; the 
others are "reproductions of words and 
thoughts," 35 recalling Merz's first drawing, 
which was published in 1949, in the Italian 
newspaper L'Unitd. The time involved in 
a Fibonacci piece is the procession of the 
numbers, which, according to the medieval 
mathematician, are open. Change is con- 
stant; indeed, it is the very substance of their 
growth. With them, Merz reconciles contin- 
uation and heterogeneity, widening his 
radius and increasing his encounters with 
situations. His propping is characterized by 
a huge multiplicity and an indivisible pace. 
A contemporary chapter, involving the use 
of the Fibonacci numbers, is the recourse 
to the spiral, an evocative figure that can 
be seen in the vegetable kingdom (grape- 
vines) and the animal kingdom (seashells 
and snails).

Merz used the spiral in an unrealized project 
for the Haus Lange, which Was designed by 
Mies van der Rone in Krefeld. It consisted 
of a drawing, published by Sperone in 
Fibonacci 1202 - Mario Merz 1970: this 
drawing, starting at the center, the cross- 
roads of the lines uniting the four imaginary 
points of the house, developed in the form 
of a spiral for the inner rooms and outer 
spaces of the edifice, which was transformed 
into a museum. The artist's goal was to act 
upon this outline, intersecting the works 
with the walls - a threat to the traditional 
method of exhibitions. The plan did not 
work out. However, Merz did execute his 
New York threats, writing them on glass 
panes: 

These writings were a series of threats. 
These threats were initiated in Krefeld when 
I found the Haus Lange by Mies van der 
Rohe and I thought of making an object that 
would relate directly and indirectly to the 
building; I wanted to make an object that 
would be inside and become the opposite of 
this so perfect edifice. That was when the 
spiral came into being, and together with the 
spiral, I began thinking of the threats to 
space. I did the threats in a space on the 
Bowery. The sentences are: "Does square 
space threaten round space?"; "Does round 
space threaten square space?"; "Is the plan 
thus round or square?"; "What is a house, 
is it a shadow on the ground or an unclear 
fraction of space? "... i4 
The helicoidal spiral differs from the flat 
spiral; symbolizing a labyrinth, it evolves 
from the center and then curls back into the 
center. In this way, it implies both direc- 
tions of movement, birth and death, posi- 
tive and negative. In nature, it is visible in 
the seashell; it also exists in man-made form 
as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
in New York, designed by Frank Lloyd 
Wright as an upside-down conch, with its 
belly towards the sky. 
In 1971, on the occasion of the Guggen- 
heim International Exhibition, a prolifera- 
tion of neon numbers was assigned to the 
outer face of the ramp, stretching on into 
the hollow. It was visible, indeed legible, 
from the ground floor, from bottom to top. 
The effect was almost magical: the numbers 
ran along the balustrade, expanding organi- 
cally. One had the impression that they 
would never end, because Wright's spiral 
suspended them aloft, projecting them to- 



wards the skylight, the outside, where the 
artificial neon light fuses with natural light. 
This was no threat, but an organic love 
relationship with Wright's organic architec- 
ture. Nevertheless, says Merz: "My goal 
was not to pay tribute to Frank Lloyd 
Wright. I wanted to reveal our ability to 
make contact with things. Europe is not 
conceived of as moving towards the Ameri- 
can future. The fact is that we Europeans 
experience reality in a different way."" The 
proliferation thus demonstrated and al- 
lowed onlookers to visualize that Fibonacci 
was the inspiration for the architect of 
Taliesin and his museum discourse. This 
work 

has the power to lighten walls and crush the 
numbers proliferating across the mural cur- 
rent and make random things of the photos, 
paintings, mirrors, works on paper, and all 
the other objects inside the building. These 
numbers made the entire building a bit silly 
- and that is their horrible secret. 56 
By placing the neon numbers along the 
inner balcony of the edifice, Merz revealed 
a precise reading of Wright's architecture, 
which, in the Guggenheim Museum, inverts 
the design procedure of the nineteenth 
century since it conceives and constructs 
from inside to outside. 57 Finally, for both 
Merz and Wright, the walls are a husk 
functioning as a natural defense - hence, 
unthinkable in terms of an abstract concept. 
As the architect said, his sense of the wall 
was not as the side of a box. It was a refuge 
against bad weather or heat, wherever 
necessary. But it was also the vehicle for 
bringing the outside inside and allowing the 
inside to project into the outside. 
Today, Merz is still using the visual catalyst 
of the neon Fibonacci numbers for reading 
either the transfiguration of his architectur- 
al positioning, the construction of the igloo, 
or the rules and methods of architecture and 
hospitable landscapes. He has looked every- 
where for opportunities, revealing a numer- 
ical repetition, which signifies an interpreta- 
tional renewal of spaces. 
The museums of Krefeld and New York 
were followed, as sites for installations by 
the Antiche Prigioni in Pescara in 1976, the 
dome of the Mole Antonelliana in Turin in 
1984, and the project for the outside of the 
Guggenheim Museum, now, in 1989. In all 
these installations, the proliferation of num- 
bers, sometimes accompanied by an object,

such as a crocodile, shatters the silence of 
a facade or curved envelope, giving them 
a rhythm and scansion, occupying them and 
making them conquerable. Furthermore, 
this proliferation demonstrates that the 
numbers, like animals or shrubs, creep 
anywhere. They are agile and liable to take 
any position, like paintings, which "do not 
necessarily have to be hung on a wall, they 
can be placed on the floor or attached to 
the ceiling. " ,x The circularity of languages 
and artistic media, of culture and painting, 
has become total; all frontiers and limits 
have fallen, so that objects and images, 
paintings and materials can follow all 
possible and imaginable trajectories. In 
1979, a crocodile, always followed by neon 
numbers, crept across the ceiling of the 
Museum Folkwang, Essen. And in 1972, 
a motorcycle, that strange mechanical ani- 
mal with horn-shaped handles, charged 
across the wall of the rotunda in the 
Museum Fridericianum, at Documenta 5; 
the title of Merz's installation was Accelera- 
tion = Dream, Fibonacci Numbers in Neon 
and Motorcycle Phantom (Accelerazione = 
sogno, tubi di Fibonacci al neon e motoci- 
cletta fantasma. The goal of the incursions 
is to keep the outlines of indefinable 
frontiers and limits alive in the system of 
art. No one can bank on a closed and 
protected perimeter or frame, because at 
times open spaces, crossings and streets, are 
the most interesting and problematical 
routes. 

In this area, Merz, since the 1970s, has been 
finding accomplices in Joseph Beuys and 
Kounellis, in Daniel Buren and Maria 
Nordman, in Fabro and Michael Asher, all 
of whom have enlarged the horizons of our 
surroundings; they have thereby discovered 
widening paths and histories, opening up 
their visual possibilities and complexities. 
These artists have enabled us to witness a 
symbolic exegesis and structuring of the 
possible linguistic intersections of both the 
anthropological and architectural environ- 
ment. Under the pressure of our surround- 
ings, each artist particularizes an aspect in 
order to make it intelligible. The critical 
consciousness of this phenomenon varies 
from one society to the next, from Europe 
to America, sliding towards an inquiry into 
the primitive magic or perceptional and 
functional implication of architecture. That 
critical consciousness focuses on the histori- 



cal and symbolical stratification as well as 
on the emptiness and the material, starting 
with natural light and with sound (issues 
raised by California artists). 39 
Merz favors material writing in and with 
the environment, exalting the mise-en-scene 
of a concrete event more than his own 
project and its analysis; he bases his method 
on a definition of common practices linked 
to vegetable growth, to human and animal 
physiology and biology. Rather than turn- 
ing his back on vital reasons and issues, he 
takes them on. For deciphering his environ- 
ment, he prefers using a naturalist symbol- 
ism of a global, indeed, universal character, 
so that the decoding proceeds on levels of 
primary exegesis. As we have already under- 
scored: for Merz, the key to interpreting 
architecture comes from within it, from the 
elements surging and wallowing on the 
inside. We have already comparea the igloo 
to a cup or bowl, a container for liquids and 
food, for which the problematics of food, 
as visual and architectural energy, should 
come as no surprise, partly because feeding 
oneself nourishes the elan vital, reconciling 
with the existential and artistic continuum. 

Paintings with Paws 

Working on the visual conversion of the 
numerical progression, after the objects and 
spaces, Merz began basing the Fibonacci 
sequence on the mobile quantity of human 
beings. In order to function as an act of 
quantitative homogeneity, the capacity for 
individuating any of their routes or contexts 
was anchored to feeding - an energy process 
that focuses on the consumption and enu- 
meration of food (fruits and vegetables 
arranged according to the Fibonacci series 
were first used by Merz in Naples in 1976). 
The artist produced the concrete physical 
perception of such a quantity of human 
numbers - A Real Sum Is a Sum of People, 
1972 - by inviting people to dinner at a 
Turin restaurant or drinks at a London pub: 
first one guest, then a second, then two, 
three, five, eight, thirteen and so on. Seated 
at the table or the bar, documented photo- 
graphically, each group comprised a num- 
ber in the Fibonacci series. The flow of 
people produced a collateral effect: the artist 
realized that while the human bodies multi- 
plied, occupying a progressive space, the 
same was not true of the tables. The tables 
remained indifferent, never synchronizing

with the number of guests, never adapting 
to and taking in the extent of their presence. 
Yet such a reception is psychologically 
important. According to Ronald Laing, the 
world can be synthesized "in the difference 
between a receptive environment and a 
nonreceptive environment, being welcome 
and not being welcome". 4 " In other words, 
the environmental condition has a psycho- 
logical impact, space acts upon the psyche, 41 
triggering happiness and subjection, power 
and security, rejection and abandonment. 
Space is not merely homogenous and isotro- 
pic, conceptual and geometric; it is a 
material that protects and envelops; it is a 
physical extension of the self (yet another 
reference to organic architecture). 
However, not all perceptible environments 
breathe with us, drawing in and out, 
changing because of us, altered by our 
bodies and our presences. Some are mono- 
lithic and one-dimensional, never moving 
or fluctuating. Now just what is a table and 
how is it to be represented? Merz chose to 
draw it as simply as possible: "I used the 
two-colour system, horizontal and vertical 
colour in which the horizontal is the plane 
or surface of the table and the vertical is its 
support." 42 The code is pictorial, recalling 
the medieval iconographies of Masaccio's 
and Giotto's frescoes, and it is therefore 
very primitive. Yet it brings the object or 
sculpture back to painting: a table is a 
painting with paws. The awareness of 
remaining within the precincts of art thus 
allows the artist to leave reality and step 
into the impossible and the fantastic. The 
tables began to grow, multiplying their 
support plane; they recall Ducnamp's idea 
of making a Readymade in which a painting 
would function as an ironing board; it 
reminds us of the tradition of painting and 
its large formats, from Pollock until today. 
/ wanted to make the most objectivized table 
possible, without bringing in any abstract 
cultural games. The table is a basic discovery 
and instrument. It is a sguare or rectangle 
in which the spaces are determined by the 
quantity of space occupied by each person. 
I calculated 50 centimetres per person as a 
standard measure.... I didn't represent the 
people, but I represented the space that a 
person occupies, so the first table is 50 
centimetres square and the sequence follows 
proportionally.... I was trying to create a 
relationship between the space of the canvas 



and real space. The space of the canvas is 
unreal, but the spatial measurement is real. 
The question is: Is it possible to make a 
canvas of this kind? In reality it is possible. 41 
In 1973, at the John Weber Gallery, New 
York, Merz constructed: it is possible to 
have a space with tables for 88 people as it 
is possible to have a space with tables for 
no one. This installation realized his plan 
for an organic growth of tables: in a spiral 
design, he arranged nine tables with pro- 
gressively widening tops that bore the neon 
numbers 1 to 34. Thus, the total number 
of seated persons was eighty-eight. The 
progression ended because the gallery space 
was not large enough to hold more tables; 
if the sequence had gone on, it would have 
collapsed, like the Pisa painting in 1963. 
In Berlin, at the Haus am Liitzowplatz in 
1973, the tables followed a physical growth, 
emphasized by the numerical presence of 
stools, but greatly exalting their pictorial 
aspect. The support surfaces were traversed 
by portions of the colored spiral, which was 
red, like the lance, the wine and the light 
of 1967, in which the Fibonacci numbers 
appear in the negative. And his tables were 
once again painted red in the large painting 
at the entrance to the Cascina Ova, in 
Tortona in 1974. The painting Boards with 
Paws Become Tables (Tavole con le zampe 
diventano tavoli), 1974, restores the breath 
of painting, which the artist had never fully 
abandoned, although he seldom practiced 
it from 1967 to 1974. Thus, because of the 
impossibility of controlling the concrete 
imaginary nature of the tables, whose 
growth was becoming unreal, Merz went 
back to representing the imaginary. He 
compensated for that impossible growth: 
Then I felt I couldn 't do any more because 
making those tables was a tremendous jolt 
with reality. So much so that in order to 
express the same thing quickly you can take 
a piece of paper and make a little drawing 
of it, precisely to avoid that jolt with 
reality.... 

Anyway, this jolt with reality was so terrible 
that I said to myself art is really a phenome- 
non that absorbs the jolt, softens the blow. 
It s true: think for instance of a medieval 
town, built with such enormous effort on the 
part of a whole community. Then along 
comes a painter and reduces the whole thing 
onto a little panel; he gets everything onto 
a tiny piece of wood. . . . Since the real table

exists, I can substitute the representation.^ 
During the period from 1974 to 1976, the 
paintings or tables were done in various 
media: oil on canvas in Untitled, 1974; 
verdigris or copper sulfate (green liquid 
pesticide applied to grape vines) in Tables 
(Tavole), 1976, on the rough walls of the 
International Pavilion at the 1976 Venice 
Biennale. Ultimately, the game of alternat- 
ing between green and red created a dynam- 
ic polarity. Green symbolizes the vegetable 
kindgom and, together with the alchemical 
red of the burning fire (the food, the people, 
the wine around the table), it reaffirms the 
regeneration of forms and energies. In 
1985, Merz constructed his huge red paint- 
ings for public use at the enormous green 
meadow of Pare Lullin in Geneva. 
The proliferation of tables created the 
proliferation of canvases. The numbers 
were regenerated on the canvases as well. 
In Up to 55 People (Fino a 55 persone), 
1976, ten small tables based on the Fibonac- 
ci series, the latter painted in the negative, 
were placed under a painting of centrifugal 
circles radiating lines and numerals up to 
55. On the other hand, Stopgap Leaves 
(Foglie tappabuchi), likewise 1976, offered 
the same sequence, but linked it to images 
of shrubs. The growth of numbers was tied 
to the expansion of languages as well as 
surfaces. The shrubs leaned against the 
walls and the canvases, electrifying their 
functions and vocations. This reacquisition 
of the intensity and freedom of painting was 
accompanied in volume by the formal 
explosion of the tables and the pictorial 
explosion of the igloos. The reciprocal 
confines jumped, and each influenced the 
other. The table took on a triangular form 
and entered the igloo in On the Table 
Which Plunges into the Heart of the Igloo 
(Aufdem Tisch, der hineinstosst in das Herz 
des Iglu, 1974. Or else the igloo turned 
black and tarry; or else the same black was 
used to draw the surfaces of tables, render- 
ing them as wall drawings in Berlin. At 
times, the table stretched out in a spiral, 
with glass, rocks and twigs: Untitled, 1976. 
Or the interior of the igloo took in rocks, 
plaster and glass: Igloo - Paving Stones and 
Broken Glass from the Destroyed House

propped and transfixed by light, 
Propped, 1970. 

As of 1975, Merz had more and 
opportunities for shows, and the possibili- 
ties of propping his pieces in museums and 
galleries impelled him to travel more and 
more to new and diverse places. Trips from 
Berlin to Basel, from London to Milan, 
from Turin to Essen were marked by the 
igloo, which became the focal point of 
equilibrium and radiation in Merz's artistic 
precinct. He used the igloo like the Navaho 
wigwam or the Mongolian yurta 45 as a 
cultural value that provides a support for 
living and surviving. Referring to the socie- 
ties and cultures that Merz experienced 
- German or Swiss, British or Italian - the 
igloo was charged with moods and impres- 
sions induced by whatever the artist discov- 
ered in situ. Tnus, in the isolation of his 
Berlin studio, Merz darkened his igloo, 
covering it with black tar and blocking its 
relationship to the outside world. However, 
this relationship was soon restored by the 
presence of transparent panes when the 
igloo was presented as a social mechanism: 
at the Haus am Liitzowplatz; or by includ- 
ing urban fragments, a car door, in Evidence 
of 987 (Evidenza di 987), 1978, at the 
Galleria Antonio Tucci Russo in Turin. The 
linguistic capacity of the igloo is maximal, 
and the interrelationship between the inter- 
nal and external factors helps to determine 
its environmental recognizability- Thus, the 
igloo becomes visible in order to take in a 
participatory process in regard to the city, 
the culture, the art system, which never 
ends. Igloos too form a proliferation. It is 
no use trying to fix the process of formation 
and information a priori: that process is 
continually found." 16 Although an objet 
trouve, it has a mode of existence that is 
sometimes personified by way of the memo- 
ries of experiences in the territory that has 
been traversed. It is a sign and a dream of 
encounter. Two poles fusing and confusing 
the creative function and the gnoseological 
function. 

/ claim that the igloo is inhabitable and that 
thus it is easy to arrive at the idea that the 
igloo has a close rapport with people. From 
my experience I have seen that people love 
it because they understand immediately its 
real and cosmological vocation. 4 
The artist wanders freely, and so objects

travel, too: the iguana and the crocodile 
overcome the force of gravity as they crawl 
over walls and ceilings; the raincoat again 
signals halts and stages; the jutting forms 
or 1965 are reintegrated in topicality: Pre- 
historic Wind from the Frozen Mountains, 
1978; the paintings link up with twigs, 
forming a simultaneous whole, in which 
every element depends on every other, 
circulating in all of them. 
In the vast neoclassical room of the Museo 
Pignatelli, Naples, Merz installed Nature Is 
the Art of the Number (La natura e I'arte 
del numero), 1976, in which all his texts 
resonated in mutual interpenetration. An 
igloo made of glass, twigs and stone was 
at the center, radiating a curvilinear iron 
table in the shape of a spiral and tongs: 
leaning on the tabletop were neon numbers, 
twigs and glass, as well as fruits and 
vegetables, piled or arranged in a progres- 
sive order. Several table legs stood amid 
packets of the newspaper Resto del Carlino 
of Bologna, which bore neon numbers 
continuing the Fibonacci sequence. 
There are many zones of interference in this 
piece: the igloo runs into the table, the table 
into the newspapers, the fruits into the 
twigs, the stones into the glass and so on. 
Each item, as in Dadaist and Surrealist 
transmutations, becomes "other than it- 
self," whereby the individual perceptional 
codes intermingle, so that the totality is 
imbued with an overall synesthesia. How- 
ever, the encounters, for the first time, give 
way to an operatic whole, which takes the 
form of a primitive village or a huge 
seventeenth-century set decoration. It is 
almost a translation of the fantastic pain- 
tings of Griinewald or Bosch into reality 
and architecture. 

The reappearance of naturalistic subjects, 
such as fruits and vegetables, recalls a 
distant realism of Merz's paintings of the 
1950s, claiming, as it does, to represent the 
world by means of the world, outside the 
common notions of painting and sculpture, 
including those of the Dadaist assemblage, 
which Merz takes up in an aggressive and 
polemical way. The inclusion of real prod- 
uce in his oeuvre expands the possibility of 
testifying to the transience and ephemeral- 
ness of life. Produce does not resist time, 
it dries out or goes bad and is then replaced. 
Object "naturalism" from Duchamp to 
Rauschenberg is universal and ideal, while 



Merz's is particular and concrete. The 
Italian artist identifies nature with history, 
but excludes the authority of its perma- 
nence: the object is historical because it does 
not remain, it is consumed and it perishes. 
Merz accepts the data of reality in its 
rawness; reality is that which is neither 
comely nor homely, nor interesting to 
interpret. All we should do is accept it and 
prop it inside ourselves. Fruits and vegeta- 
bles, from lemons to tomatoes, from pump- 
kins to beans, have an offensive beauty: they 
seduce with their colors and shiny, delicate 
skins, with their fragrances; but then, when 
time consumes them, they repel us; squoos- 
hy and wrinkled, rotten ancf foul-smelling, 
tney bear a resemblance to life and death. 
It is particular time that is narrated, the hie 
et nunc of a historical experience that 
brooks no distinctions or hierarchies of 
value, because it relies on the "truth" of a 
fruit or vegetable, which possesses a natural 
time. Merz has always been opposed to a 
descriptive painting "of history"; he has 
chosen the drama and tragedy of living "in 
history." Along these lines, one could state 
that the artist intends to refashion himself 
in terms of a realism whose positions are 
those of Caravaggio's. He thus makes a 
moral and politicalcommitment as an artist, 
and also reveals his polemical and critical 
character in confronting formalist and clas- 
sical art, from Minimalism to Neo-Expres- 
sionism. As a good observer of truth, Merz 
believes solely in the history of the factual 
given, whatever it may be, as in wall works 
like the painting Nine Vegetables (Nove 
verdure), 1978, or floor works; The Island 
of Fruit (L'isola della frutta), 1976, which 
comprise the entire process of maturity and 
aging, life and death. 

The passage of time is cannibalistic; every 
minute devours the previous one, project- 
ing itself into it and introjecting it, in a 
continuous feeding, just as the table de- 
vours the igloo and the newspapers devour 
the table: information eats forms, but the 
latter submerge in thought and news. 
At the Villa Pignatelli, the newspapers 
actually represent the force of expansion, the 
twigs the force of cohesion, the igloo the 
concentrated weight of a dome. Nineteenth- 
century landscapes always have a powerful 
shadow that comes from the forest, a 
powerful light that comes from the plain, a 
powerful expansive panic that comes from

the sky. These three powers together prod- 
uce the landscape. This, we may say, is a real 
landscape, a true modern landscape, with 
electricity, newspapers, twigs, glass. 48 
The precise topography of a landscape or 
grove, a blend of woods and architecture, 
streets and gardens, demonstrates that 
Merz's work has no archeological value, 
this is no dig in the history of contemporary 
legend. The fruit island is an atoll in a huge 
archipelago, with flourishing gardens, like 
Pratolino and Bomarzo, and fairy-tale im- 
agery. It is a reservoir of marvels and 
wonders, a hortus conclusus of medieval 
remembrance, where the tumultuous speed 
of Merz's imagination and his hand give 
breath to prodigious and unwonted appari- 
tions. He thereby takes up the pre-Renais- 
sance tradition""'' of visualizing prodigious 
places and creatures, associated with the 
labyrinth of the forest and with the under- 
world. The presence of such monsters 
(Latin monstrum means "marvel") ,,) marks 
the history of art, recurring as an aesthetic 
and iconographic motif from Mannerism 
until the present, in Bosch and Giambolo- 
gna, in Gninewald and Goya, in Arcimbol- 
do (to whom Merz, in 1987, dedicated a 
large painting involving wicker, glass, fruit, 
and a silver crocodile) and Chagall, all the 
way to de Kooning. 

The appearance of fruit became important 
for me, from an existential point of view: 
I am impressed by the tremendous reproduc- 
tive capacity of nature.... Faced with the 
enormousness of a thing, such as a heap of 
fruit, you are bound to discover something 
similar to innocence. You have to rediscover 
an elementary imagination and a kind of 
innocence inside yourself, since emotion is 
something truly upsetting.... I can under- 
stand Leonardo da Vinci's problem: he had 
to comprehend nature and depict it as 
emotionally as possible.... When the pain- 
ter's hand becomes nature, it represents the 
imagination.^ 1 

Not surprisingly, as of 1976, Merz moved 
from constructing an imaginary, indeed 
fantastic landscape to painting or depicting 
a fauna of portentous animals and extraor- 
dinary beasts, which henceforth roamed 
plains and mountains, vistas and cliff walls 
(in galleries and museums) during the 
artist's vagabondage. The inclusion of ani- 
mals was part of the hunter's panorama. 
The fantastic zoology, going back to the 



Late Paleolithic, from Altamira to Lascaux, 
was affirmed in relation to the voyages of 
the Phoenicians and the raids of the Celts; 
it was used by Diirer and metaphorized by 
Beuys. The sources are thus ancient, but the 
sensibility is contemporary. What makes 
these motifs attractive is the exaltation of 
the poetic nature of the elements, their 
mythical and mysterious character. 
Nevertheless, Merz does not indulge in any 
meticulous or controlled observation of his 
animal morphology; he is interested in the 
fantasy value, not the scientific meaning. 
His creatures are organic in terms of his 
notion of landscape and nature, forests and 
mountains, history and time. They come 
from far away to achieve a resemblance, 
participate in his portrait, in the line that 
began in 1945. The memory of their 
existence is topical and contemporary, be- 
cause, at the time of their depiction, 1976, 
when art, with Neo-Expressionist painting 
and appropriation, Transavantgarde and 
Neo-Fauve, with the citation of history and 
the eclecticism of images that come from his 
past, Merz looked back to prehistoric times, 
to archetypes and primeval images. Rather 
than reworking, refiguring history, he re- 
turned to original exemplars, not in archeo- 
logical or monumental terms, but from a 
critical vantage point: that of the artist 
living in his own time, in his contemporari- 
ness. Fundamental to grasping this direct 
and immediate coexistence of past and 
present, memory and topicality, is the 
painting Prehistoric Wind from the Frozen 
Mountains, 1911 . 

The "prehistoric wind" is something that 
removes the purely physical aspect of the 
wind, offering a sense of time that every man 
has inside himself: the sense of prehistoric 
time is that of a gigantic time which 
manifests itself as a kind of wind. The frozen 
mountains are a poetic expression for glacia- 
tions. My work is always linked to time, to 
the sense of time that occasionally contra- 
dicts the realism of current time, resembling, 
instead, a metaphysics of time. Time is the 
path on which humanity is bound to live and 
the history of being history. . . . The night of 
humanity is the animal, especially the most 
ancient kind. 52 

This canvas shows the image of a mountain 
or erupting volcano marked by the Fibonac- 
ci numbers and with a leaning forest of 
twigs. The impression is that of a landscape

with a mountain looming above the forest. 
Above all, the twigs 

represent the woods, but they are also 
interesting in that they represent a totality, 
a numerical series. They are close together, 
thus creating an intensely emotional situa- 
tion. If you take a tree and isolate it, you 
have something very poignant and fantas- 
tic... Art is recognized more by imagination 
than by escape and scattering. . . . The vivacity 
of fantasy is fantasy itself: it is not subject 
to any normal process. It has sudden dis- 
charges that set up new image problems. 
Because some images seem to move more 
swiftly than others, which are stable.... For 
me, painting is velocity. fJ 
The twigs return, together with the title, 
Prehistoric Wind from the Frozen Moun- 
tains in other works about time and the 
swift flow of images. In 1979, at the 
Museum Folkwang, Essen, they were in- 
serted into the Untitled works of 1965, 
while Crocodile (Coccodrillo), 1979, offered 
shrubbery to conceal the moving reptile. 
As of 1979, Merz's paintings of animals 
formed a fantastic herd, joining the parched, 
aggressive plain of the igloos and tables, 
covered witn stone and glass, crawling over 
walls and through rooms containing terres- 
trial systems, mathematical writings and 
migrant natures. A legendary fauna and 
flora developed, actuating a spatial merry- 
go-round, two-dimensional, three-dimen- 
sional, subjecting fantasy to the banality of 
everyday life. In this circulation of noctur- 
nal figures such as the owl, or portentous 
figures such as the lion and the tiger, the 
dream of a prehistoric wind becomes reality. 
Old Bison on the Savannah (Vecchio bisonte 
nella savana, 1979, Rhinoceros (Rinoceron- 
te), 1980, Cervidi, 1981-these creatures live 
in forests, plains, mountains, they seem to 
have come down to the threshold of the 
igloo: solitary and autobiographical evoca- 
tions of a both archaic and current genesis. 
Mountain Lion (Leone di montagna), 1981, 
can represent the fate of the artist, a loner 
on a mountain peak, gazing at his illuminat- 
ing investigation, his organic thought: the 
Middle Ages claimed that the lion came into 
the world with his eyes open towards the 
sun.^ Sharing the same bellicose attitude is 
Tiger (Tigre), 1981, which has more power- 
fulinstinctual thrusts - sudden movements, 
which make him more aggressive and 
dangerous. However, these animals have a 



diurnal vision, which is soon joined by the 
nocturnal vision of Merz's Owl (Gufo), 
1981, and Nocturnal Animals (Animali 
notturni), 1981, which close the natural 
circle. 

As animals, these paintings go around the 
architectural obstacles, crawling over walls, 
jumping and loping on ceilings, nervously 
passing through space, like the painting 
Untitled, 1981, which, at the ARC /Musee 
d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, ventured 
up to the skylight, together with its twigs. 
Merz bends them and adapts them to all 
situations, because he wants to shatter the 
immobility and perceptional rigidity of 
painting. 

Beyond tying them to the ground, I see my 
paintings crawl up the wall. They promptly 
turn into a creeping crocodile or lizard. They 
are the gecko with its perfect anatomical 
balance that hovers on the wall. 
I very much want the canvas to creep rather 
than being on the wall in a decorative 
sense. And since for me, the crocodile is a 
mythically enlarged gecko, it can represent 
paintings. The canvas becomes a gecko and 
vice versa, and they both creep along the 
wall." 

And, like a gecko, Merz's paintings wind 
through all sinuosities, bending to the turns 
and accidents of architecture. His paintings 
stop where the wall stops - Billiard Hall 
(Sala dei biliardi), 1981 -or replace the 
wall, thereby creating their own structure: 
Sphinx and Chickenlike Predator (Sfinge e 
r apace gallinaceo) and Gecko (Geco), both 
1983. The horizon of the twigs, with its 
memory of forests and savannahs, woods 
and fields, sees the moving twigs, imposing 
and rapid, with their blazing and explosive 
colors, swiftly sprayed or violently 
squeezed out of the tube and upon the 
canvas. These two techniques - swift spray- 
ing or direct application of pigment on the 
canvas, which is never mounted on a 
stretcher, join the artist's hand in sharing 
the risk of error and astonishment. 
The decision to work in this way on the 
execution and the continuous surfaces, 
which can adapt or submit to the environ- 
ment, ultimately demonstrates the natural- 
ist and animal character of Merz's artistic 
project. Unlike Kiefer, Merz does not try 
to perfect the world, expanding his historic 
strokes, the dramas of his legends and 
massacres, because he has already analyzed

and expiated them politically and ideologi- 
cally. And unlike Baselitz, Merz does not 
attempt to confront the problem of verisi- 
militude in order to force it to a crisis by 
turning things upside down pictorially and 
visually. Rather, Merz prefers to reach the 
profound waters of the imagination, mov- 
ing at high speed in order to avoid being 
shattered. Still and all, his attitude cannot 
be regarded as romantic. His prestissimo is 
that of the metropolis, where the individual 
moves in an evanescent and foreign manner; 
where memory is lightning, an instantane- 
ous eruption of images. Certain images 
manage to get composed into figures: a 
landscape, a face, a leaf, an animal Every- 
one lives in them, because, as Paul Valery 
puts it, "we are enclosed in an eternal 
fragment of ourselves." 56 
Naturally, Merz is fully aware of the risk 
involved in his unreal existence; as a result, 
he sometimes violates its silent and circum- 
spect shifts, immobilizing them by transfix- 
ing them with a neon arrow: Crocodile in 
the Night (Coccodrillo nella notte), 1979, 
and Rhinoceros, 1980. He also proposes 
them anew as cognitional icons (neon, we 
recall, illuminates and also symbolizes the 
critical consciousness), for a painting that 
philosophizes about the beloved world. The 
luminous arrow is the index of a descent 
into the secret profundities of the unknown, 
the seat of the imagination's power. Indeed, 
neon is assigned the task of offering the 
poetic writing of the artist. It cools off the 
words written by a mysterious creature, a 
strange nomad who passes through Places 
Without Streets (Luoghi senza strada) , 1979, 
or Arrives at Borders, 1983. A warrior and 
a poet who identifies with Giap, the 
Vietnamese general, or with Ezra Pound: 
If the hoarfrost grip thy tent thou wilt give 
thanks when night is spent, 1978. Or else 
he defines Utopia and creates a dream 
identity for the artist: If the Form Vanishes, 
Its Root Is Eternal (se la forma scompare la 
sua radice e eterna), 1982, and Painter in 
Africa (Pittore in Africa), 1983. 

Water houses 

Whether in the guise of a number or a line, 
neon, for Merz, represents union, the pas- 
sages between materials, filling the gaps 
between them. Its illuminating presence in 
the body of the canvas or the beast, an 
object or an igloo, not only lacerates them, 



but also reveals their secret underground 
centers; it makes them transparent and 
brings them up to the surface. It thus 
exposes their thickness, which is a bark or 
a skin, a glass or a pigment, a canvas or a 
net: any material captured by the artist's eye 
or by his history as a nomad. 
Starting in 1979, after years of movement, 
the igloo turned up among Merz's captured 
images. Double Igloo (Doppio igloo) ap- 
peared, first in Essen, then in London, 
Eindhoven and Paris; 57 it consisted of a big 
glass igloo, which in turn contained a clay 
igloo, both of them transfixed by two or 
three lines of neon light. One igloo captures 
the other, housing it and superimposing 
itself. It simultaneously dreams it and 
blocks it within time. The superimposition 
alludes to the geological theme of sedi- 
ments, adding something that it did not 
have originally: it places it in perspective 
and historicizes it. By establishing a before 
and after, an inside and outside around 
itself, it permits a self-generation, a capacity 
for initiative, which will allow it to be alone 
or together with other igloos, to appear 
delicate and light or robust and heavy, 
ultimately achieving a circumference of 
several yards in The Drop of Water, Bor- 
deaux, 1987. When all is said and done, the 
double igloo is a snail or spiral that carries 
inside and around its own soft body, in clay; 
its sap and its sensory apparatuses, which, 
until 1979, were exposed, are now shielded 
by a second igloo. 

What does that mean? During the 1970s, 
such artists as Georg Baselitz and A.R. 
Penck, Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cuc- 
chi, reacted to the cold Conceptualist ana- 
lyses and the mythopoetic or dematerialized 
images created by poor and raw materials. 
The new focus or interest was the quest for 
an imagery that would restore the absolute 
value of the canvas, the painting, removing 
all ideology and Utopia from its territory, 
all radicalism and love of the future, and 
exalting an exasperated subjectivism indif- 
ferent to the outside and concentrating 
solely on the individual and linguistic 
introjection, that of painting per se and 
painting for painting's sake. There was a 
passionate demand for a return to history 
as the history of art and for an expressionist 
painting that would confirm the ironical 
invention, as a process of the self. 
Starting in 1980, the expansion of that

"new" painting turned into an avalanche, 
powerfully impelled by a market that want- 
ed to eliminate the "difficulties" of Concep- 
tualism, Body Art and Land Art. Defense 
was necessary, and here the igloo repaired 
itself, its history and its nucleus of sensitivi- 
ty, while the paintings of animals were not 
stable, but agitated, pierced by neon, labile 
and mobile, because they synchronized with 
the changing moods of the forest of twigs 
or the hardness of mountain stones. 
The stratification of painting during the 
1980s signifies more than just a mercantile 
invasion; it connotes the loss of a political 
sense and the renunciation of a critical 
ability. It also exalts a cynicism that permits 
itself no power of social depth and is intent 
solely on creating a personal and narcissistic 
myth: the artist as hero. Nevertheless, the 
impact on conceptual and bodily ara- 
besques, which took shape during the late 
seventies with the mannerist involutions of 
Conceptual Art and Process Art, triggered 
a new interest in the painting of historical 
vanguards-the kind of painting that had not 
accepted the Dadaist emptying, a matrix for 
the reductivism and nonphysicality of the 
object in the 1960s. The focus shifted to 
Futurism and Italian metaphysics, from 
Boccioni to Giorgio de Chirico as well as 
Max Beckmann's renewal of Expression- 
ism. And it was on this side of the reference 
to history that Merz's painting /sculpture 
differed from the works of the new painters. 
If Kiefer and Georg Baselitz believe in a 
common appeal for the solidification of a 
creative elan rooted in the tragedy and 
Dionysian spirit of Nietzsche, and if Cucchi 
and Clemente look back to the visionary 
and metaphysical paintings of Odilon Re- 
don and Alberto Savinio, Mario Merz is a 
child of Futurism. He follows a tradition 
that links Boccioni to Fontana; he feels that 
the object is in perpetual motion, seeking 
a different space, exploding in light or 
crossing a threshold into a new dimension. 
Merz works on simultaneous situations and 
on a sequence of energy flows, so that, as 
in Boccioni, material and light enter the 
painting, or, as in Antonio Sant'Elia, the 
architectural totalities are generated by the 
joint presence of materials and forms, 
rhythms and diverse planes, which, howev- 
er, flow into one another. 
Evidence for this difference is to be found 
in Dark Light Light Dark (Oscuro chiaro 



chiaro oscuro), presented in San Marino in 
1983. This installation consisted of two 
tangentially intersecting igloos: one, made 
of twigs, was closed and dark; the other, 
made of glass, was light and transparent. 
Further evidence is offered by Giant Woods- 
men (I giganti boscaiuoli), 1981-82, and 
Coniferous Gems (Gemma con if era), 1981- 
82, which brought back not only animals 
and mountains, but also the theme of the 
lance, a sign of speed and penetration, of 
racing ana the internal /external relation- 
ship, as well as the cinematic multiplication 
of steps - typical Futurist subjects: 
/ wrote chiaro /oscuro (light /dark): dark 
and light are not opposite s, they overlap and 
probably recognize one another. In that sort 
of condition, they recognize one another 
instead of declaring themselves to be in a 
formal antithesis.... The material is trans- 
formed. ...It is truly a material that flows 
rather than covering.... I must say that 
certain of Sant'Elia 's drawings of future 
cities were done according to the same 
system. ™ 

Giant Woodsmen, which sparked a series 
of large-format works shown at the Sperone 
Westwater Gallery, New York, and in 
Bateau ivre, 1983, shown at Leo Castelli, 
Greene Street, New York, in 1985, create 
the sensation of movement by reiterating 
the figure and its steps, just as Balla's The 
Girl Running to the Balcony, 1912, used the 
repetition of the gesture of walking. The 
figure was already present in Merz's Run- 
ning Legs (gambe che corrono), 1980, and 
in the repetition of the strange bodies in his 
The Lombard Plane (Pianura Padana), 
1981, where, however, it became monu- 
mental and obsessive. In Giant Woodsmen, 
it leans against the vertices of two lance 
wedges; while in Bateau ivre, it is accompa- 
nied by the sequence Four Tables in the 
Shape of Magnolia Leaves (Quattro tavole 
in forma di foglie di magnolia), 1985. 
In Giant Woodsmen the sequence, running 
from top to bottom, shows the mountain 
bearing the two lance cones on which their 
steps rest, two portions of the human 
figure. The metaphor can be deciphered: 
natural matter (the mountain with its soil, 
woods and twigs) bears on its peak the two 
lance cones, whose three-dimensionality 
recalls the triangle in space, a magical figure 
of movement and sensory initiation. Two 
human figures, whose bodies are not visi-

ble, prop their feet on their points. The 
double corporality represents the artist's 
dual being, the sum of one and one (again 
Fibonacci): the artist sees himself as sepa- 
rate, dispossessed of a process of self- 
producing that goes from inside to outside, 
existing as a shadow and radiation of 
himself. The human figure, with a twisting 
of its own center - attested to in Bateau 
ivre, by the canvas that twists inversely - 
turns into a shrub and a tree. The gliding 
of visual energv is thus framed in a perspec- 
tive that is fiistorical, in the sense of 
referring to the energy emitted by Futurism, 
and alchemical, in its thrust towards trans- 
forming the human being into an "other." 
A propos of Merz's earliest paintings, we 
spoke of their correspondence with Dubuf- 
fet's Texturologies - a bond that recurs in 
these paintings, but in a totally opposite 
pattern, in the use of colors - specifically, 
in their impasto and luminosity. Merz's 
igments and spray techniques reject Du- 
uffet's altered perceptions of primitive and 
cursed culture, his connections with Art 
Brut. Rather, Merz's pigments are inspired 
by the chromatic and dazzling explosions 
of the modern city, by the speed and chaos 
that characterize them, by the pointless 
labyrinthine play of encounters amid factors 
contrasting with nature. 
But what is a lance or an arrow if not a bar 
that separates the gap between things? And 
that is why Merz always confronts the 
problem and "the need to negate the 
assumption that painting was something 
self-contained... that its exact contents were 
the tables and objects surrounding it." 5 ' 
This is a better solution for filling the gap 
between sculpture and painting; they are 
combined by the canvas and the igloo. 
Hence, doing away with the antithesis 
between the soft, vertical body of the canvas 
and the sharp, rigid, closed, dome-shaped 
body of the igloo means legitimizing their 
dialectics, making it impossible to distin- 
guish them in order to have them live on 
their mutual bewilderment. In Architecture 
Built by Time, Architecture Demolished by 
Time (Architettura f on data da I 'tempo, ar c ki- 
te ttura sf on data dal tempo), 1981, the 
duality of an osmotic existence linking the 
parts is affirmed to its maximum potential. 
Above all, the title speaks of a totality 
motivated by a twofold condition of con- 
struction and destruction. That is to say, it 



constitutes a closed, sheltered covering that 
is then opened by way of windows and 
doors. The double-fronted use of a single 
definition establishes that the verbs, that is, 
the actions, hence the actors, can exchange 
roles (Artaud's The Theater and Its Double 
is often mentioned in connection with 
Merz). In Architecture Built by Time, 
Architecture Demolished by Time, the bod- 
ies of the painting and the igloo forfeit their 
autonomy and are framed inside one anoth- 
er, constructing themselves and being de- 
stroyed. The same may be said of the 
painting. For the first time, the edges of the 
broken glass are marked with pigments, as 
if demonstrating that painting must remain 
jagged and hazardous, just as the igloo can 
become frail and colored. 
Khadafi's Tent (Tenda di Ghedda/i), shown- 
at the Musee d'Art Moderne, Centre 
Georges Pompidou, Paris, had the usual 
metal structure of Merz's other igloos, but 
for the first time its dome was covered with 
painted burlap and each segment contains 
the image of a lance. Finally, likewise for 
the first time, the igloo had an open side 
through which the public could enter. Both 
this piece and Architecture Built by Time 
speak of a simultaneously external and 
internal vision; both operate with ambigui- 
ty and on the threshold established by the 
dissociation and association of the opposi- 
tional dyads: painting/sculpture, in- 
side/outside, transparent/opaque, rig- 
id/soft.... Art is thus a union of extremes, 
existing at the extremes, connecting two 
opposite edges, as in Stone Igloo (Igloo di 
pietra), 1982, shown at Documenta 7, 
Kassel, which straddled a small stream. It 
was virtually a gangplank, an overpass, a 
bridge, made of tie beams and wooden 
structures, as in Une ouvree, une mesure de 
terre qui donne un portrait bien terrestre, 
1987, exhibited at the Galleria Pietro 
Sparta in Chagny. In this installation, the 
beans of wood and the iron ramps bear 
numbers, which pass across an ocean of 
twigs and cement blocks. We see the image 
of water discharged in What's To Be Done?, 
1968, except that the situation is now 
changed, the small spurt can become a 
stream, as in Kassel, or a river, as in The 
River Appears (II f Hume appare), 1986, a 
title covering two different installations (a 
further duality and polarity). The version 
shown at Galleria Antonio Tucci Russo,

Turin, had metal arches over a river of 
packets of newspapers; while the version 
presented at the Prato had a huge canvas 
with the image of a cone plus Fibonacci 
numbers in paint and neon and, on the 
inside, a stream of transparent glass, like 
water. Water also turned up in Bordeaux, 
in The Drop of Water, 1988, and in Nagoya, 
in Pouring of Remote Times, Here, Now 
(Versamento di tempi lontani, qui, or a), 
1988, in which water running from a faucet 
constituted an analogy with the growth of 
Japanese bamboo and mellowed the sharp- 
ness of the Bordeaux installation; in fact, 
it was placed on the sharp point of a large 
triangular table. 

Water, writes Gaston Bachelard, "is the 
element most apt to illustrate the themes of 
combinations of powers. It assimilates so 
many substances. It gathers opposite mate- 
rials with equal ease."' 1 " So far, our reading 
of Merz's work has focused on the dialecti- 
cal and osmotic character of the elements. 
It lives on their blendings, on the way they 
cooperate to concretize a real imagery. Merz 
began with a fire water (a bottle or wine), 
which turned into neon light and recurred 
in a torrent of twigs and glass, as if the artist 
had managed to drive the materials crazy 
during his decades of travel, ultimately 
entrusting himself to his delirious, yet 
fantastic and astounding way of experienc- 
ing them and seeing them. 
Or perhaps we should say that the artist 
himself is a torrent of water, which, in order 
to find or build a conduit, has been impelled 
by its own desires or by the historical and 
cultural situations to traverse valleys and 
plains, museums and galleries, flowing 
amid their stones and boulders, portals and 
columns, finally to achieve - albeit only for 
a split second - a continuous voyage, a 
"house of water." A huge lake with an 
archipelago of imaginary islands - imagi- 
nary because they are made up of twigs and 
stones, igloos and tables, glass and plaster, 
neon and wax, pigment and canvas, sculp- 
ture and painting. Such were the results 
during the past few years: at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich in 1985 or the Cape of Bordeaux in 
1987, or the Chapelle Saint-Louis de la 
Salpetriere in Paris, in 1987, or at the ICA 
of Nagoya in 1988, or the Los Angeles 
Museum of Contemporary Art in 1989. 
In all these spaces, Merz moved like water 
running or grass growing amid rocks. 



Inspired by a love-hate attitude towards 
architecture, he tended to stake off a refuge 
independent of any given context: whether 
it was a modern edifice in Zurich, Nagoya 
or Los Angeles, or a historical one in 
Bordeaux or Paris. At those sites, he created 
a personal architecture capable of occupyng 
the absolute center of the environment and 
functioning as a sacral and ritual icon: a 
frail, sensual moss on which to delicately 
prop his writings and his igloos. 
Naturally, given the diverse cultural territo- 
ries of Europe, America and Asia, Merz had 
to adapt to varying situations. In Zurich, 
amid a Swiss silence, the artist loudly aimed 
at the totality, or quasi-totality, of his 
igloos. Rejecting the serene climate of 
Nordic contemplation, he insisted on a 
synesthesia of forms and media, materials 
and writings, which identified each single 
igloo. Merz constructed an arcane and 
primitive village, articulated in its paths and 
streets, with its own flora and fauna (paint- 
ings on walls). He managed to set up the 
entire body of a nomadic existence, a life 
of sulfur and fire, of hunts and lances, in 
the company of crocodiles and rhinoce- 
roses. 

On the other hand, in Nagoya and Los 
Angeles, he worked with spaces that lacked 
sulfur, he confronted hieratic spaces with 
an Oriental matrix. Merz thus attempted 
sudden swerves that broke the immunity 
and shattered the frozen and controlled 
climate of the given architecture. He pro- 
duced a spiral table whose organic form 
contrasted utterly with the given compo- 
sure and order. In order to intensify the 
disharmony, the artist covered the table 
with stones and lead, achieving a brutally 
decomposed image. Beyond the initial im- 
pact of aggression towards and energetic 
contortion of architecture, the table reveals 
a sensitive interior that harmonizes with the 
site. Thus, in Nagoya, in relation to the Zen 
gardens, the center of the spiral (or its end, 
depending on your standpoint - yet another 
duality) is marked by a bamboo cane and 
a waterfall. The water, flowing continous 
is linked to a red neon light, virtually 



5 

signifying the integration of or osmosis 
between water and fire, Antiquity and 
Modernity, nature and technology - the 
vast flowerbed of recent Japanese civiliza- 
tion. Finally, we have the ensemble of 
works at the Chapelle Saint-Louis de la

Salpetriere. Suposedly, the chapel rose in 
this place, which was sanctified, because it 
yielded a precious material like saltpeter. 
Eventually, the building was turned into a 
powder storehouse, and then, during the 
late seventeenth century, under Louis XIV, 
it became an asylum for vagabonds and 
lunatics. Here, Jean Martin Charcot con- 
ducted his early neurological research on 
hysteria. At present, the chapel is part of 
the complex of the Salpetriere Hospital. 
The chapel per se is already a grand 
metaphor. It delineates a wavering between 
the joining and disjoining of historical 
aspects, the great oscillations of human 
affairs, the multiple sections of a building, 
its conversions and fundamental exoduses, 
from positive to negative, from vital to 
mortal. This grand metaphor also involves 
the memory of an immense flow of energy 
and blood, passion and death, religiosity 
and lay dereliction. Merz came here in 
autumn of 1987 and set up his alchemical 
repertoire, his flow of thoughts and materi- 
als, his writings and his igloos. He did so 
conscious of the energy imprisoned here. 
He touched neither the sacred decoration 
nor the walls; that is, rather than asking for 
an environmental purification, he agreed to 
integrate himself into the crumblings of 
architecture and history; and, rather than 
trying to re-release them, he pursued a 
brinkmanship along their abyss. 
Facing the altar, Merz wrote an enigmatic 
sentence in neon on net, indicating a 
suspension that torments both art and life: 
If the Form Vanishes, Its Root Is Eternal. 
Around this, following the cross structure 
of the church, the artist placed, in the main 
transept and in its side chapels, the stratifi- 
cations of stone and glass that produced the 
triple igloo 853, 1985, The River Appears, 
1986, Homage to Arcimboldo (Omaggio ad 
Arcimboldo) , 1987, and Path Through Here 
(Sentiero per qui), 1986. The resulting 
landscape had a disfigured heaviness, as if 
the totality wanted to participate in the 
darkness of history and of the site. Every- 
thing seemed blackened, as if mindful of an 
image of putrefaction, but also imbued with 
the dust of time. It emanated a sacred 
presence and horror. The scene was charged 
with a profound truth, which recalled a 
fleeing thing. 

Nevertheless, the stones of the igloo strug- 
gled against the suction of the floor stones; 



the cold neon light contrasted with the 
skylights and sunbeams; the igloos, with 
two and three domes, resisted the architec- 
tural whirlpool. And finally, the lay thought 
that believes in materials and human beings, 
in nature and animals, dialectically opposed 
the religions vision. As usual, it was 
important for Merz to enter the very belly 
of the situation and establish a bond 
between his own existence and the context. 
However, he passed amid the stones like 
water and grass. In this sacred perimeter, 
he staked off and constructed a smithy and 
a refuge. The artist was at their center, like 
the glass igloo Places Without Streets, 1987, 
which was isolated by a field of twigs; he 
surrounded himself with altars, confession- 
als and faldstools. It was here that Merz, 
after accepting the encounter or dialectics 
with sacred architecture and its tragic 
events, cut himself an inaccessible perime- 
ter, soft and delicate, hard and granitic, 
transparent and dark; an intimacy shielded 
by those same twigs, but irrigated by the 
liquid fire of light, settled upon the igloo. 
What did this new environment represent? 
If the twigs are a forest, is the igloo in the 
middle the lair of a human being or an 
animal? Are good or bad forces, conscious 
or unconscious, rational or irrational forces 
channeled into this space? Is the central 
edifice a site of pleasure or pain, frailty or 
cruelty? Merz certainly worked with the 
mobility of the metaphors, with the simulta- 
neous active /passive and positive /negative 
function of the meanings, which took in all 
the opposites; yet the place nevertheless 
presented something more. The continuous 
state of metamorphosis in his oeuvre as- 
sumes dramatic connotations. His creative 
research is transformed into a place where 
all the linearities and immobilities of the 
system of art crumble, because they result 
from a lucid madness, typical of a nomad 
who, like a vagabond and lunatic, lives on 
the limits of traditional art.

Germano Celant 



Interview with Mario Merz, Turin, 1983 



/ would like to begin this interview by 
asking you about your earliest childhood 
memories. What images have you retained 
about your childhood, your home and your 
parents? 

My strongest image is that of a chestnut tree 
that touched the windows of my room. Its 
branches, covered with chestnuts and 
leaves, knocked against my window panes, 
so that throughout my childhood, I spent 
hours and hours watching the changing 
colors and forms. The tree looked like an 
enormous mass next to our house, which 
stood on a hill. Our home wasn't very large, 
and during the war, my father, an engineer 
and inventor, added a shelter. This refuge 
was built at a right angle into the hill 
- almost two perpendicular parallelepipeds 
dug into the tufa. That was where we hid 
out, even from friends. Another memory I 
have of those years is the burned synagogue 
of Turin. It made a profound impact on me, 
and I can still see that image today. 
How old were you? 

Oh, let me see, I spent years upon years in 
that room, so I don't recall exactly now old 
I was. I have to add that I don't have much 
of a sense of time. For me, time continues 
and never stops, and when a past period of 
time comes back, it is the same time, even 
if it has become something different. This 
sense of not having a sense of time puts me 
physically, but not systematically or mental- 
ly, close to certain Eastern religions, or 
rather, not so much religions, but certain 
Eastern ways of thinking - mentalities that 
do not have a sense of time - that sense has 
expired. The Western mind thinks in terms 
of, say, your first girl friend, then finds the 
second one; while the sense of time as today, 
which binds up everything, is highly impor- 
tant for me. Without realizing it, I have 
always instuited that the advance of time 
allowed me to decipher a mode of existence: 
being and living with these images in front 
of me - this tree, which was that tree. 
A very romantic memory. 
I've always been very fond of Romanticism, 
both the German and the Italian kind, that 
of Giacomo Leopardi [1798, Recanati - 
1837, Naples; Romantic poet], for that 
sense of scansion, and even Oriental Ro- 
manticism, because the sense of seasons is 
not so marked in human beings. A human 
being does not become aggressive or wicked 
according to passing time; rather, it is 



passing time that is deciphered. 
Actually, I suggested this reading in time 
because today it is impossible to determine 
that a branch struck your window .... 
Certainly, but today I find that it is the same 
branch, it hasn't changed. When I read the 
newspaper and see the things that are 
happening in Lebanon, I tell myself: I have 
experienced these things. I don't know 
why, but I have experienced them, in 
periods when the positions were totally 
different. 

Then you remember the bombings, the 
flights to shelters, the experiences of 
war .... 

Yes, those are events that I have experi- 
enced, like the physical trauma of death, in 
the presence of something that strikes you 
mechanically from the outside. I have 
already experienced the sense of total indif- 
ference to such dramatic things, the ability 
to withdraw. But I have also experienced 
the sense of enjoying the seasons, the arrival 
of the marvelous summer, with its fruits, 
even amid bombings, as well as the fact that 
people always have both a physical and a 
physiological hope of survival. I have 
experienced that. 

And the hillside house you were talking 
about - was it bombed when you and your 
family were inside? 

We were underneath, in that famous shel- 
ter. When we emerged, part of the house 
had collapsed. 

Did you and your family hear the bombs? 
We kept hearing an intense noise. Further 
down the hill, our friend's house was on 
fire. The entire roof was already consumed, 
and so the house was destroyed in no time 
at all, the walls couldn't hold. In contrast, 
my father's house, where I lived with my 
mother and my sister, was still half erect. 
They put up a wooden staircase on the 
outside, ana life went on. I remembered 
using that stairway for years. I attended 
school, and I always managed to use that 
outside wooden staircase. I had no prob- 
lems with it. 

That was 1943, wasn't it? 
I'm not sure whether I want to get into 
exasperating political situations, but after 
those bombings of 1943, Pietro Badoglio 
[marshal during Fascist regime, subsequent- 
ly Vicerov or Ethiopia and then made 
premier of' Italy by King Vittorio Emanuele 
III on September 8, 1943, after Mussolini's 



fall] and the armistice came in September, 
ancl then the Germans arrived. 
You instantly joined a Partisan group? 
Turin was extremely political, especially the 
bourgeoisie. There was Giustizia e Liberta 
[partisan group during Fascist regime] 
which I joined, and the Communists, who 
attracted Luciano Pistoi [who was to be- 
come director of the Galleria d'Arte Notizie, 
Turin, which first presented artists such as 
Paolini, Fabro and Melotti] together with 
a whole series of other people who were 
actually Communists. There was a slight 
difference between the Communists and 
Giustizia e Liberta. Today, when I read 
Giustizia e Liberta in the old bulletins, 
it's like reading current publications by 
the Autonomia and Democrazia Proletaria 
left-wing political groups]. They were terri- 
}le . . . Marxism. The Liberals formed still 
another group. 

Did you head for the mountains right away 
or . . .? 

No, I didn't head for the mountains, I was 
too young, I was still in school. 
You were eighteen? 

I was going to school, but associating with 
people who distributed leaflets. I handed 
the leaflets out in school, and, naturally, one 
fine day, the last Fascists mounted an 
attack, they were so strange in those outfits, 
I always saw them as something strange. 
They were terrible Fascists, they would 
shoot on sight ... so strange. It was a 
miracle that I wasn't killed. Yes, it was a 
miracle because Luciano Pistoi was more 
involved in the organization and he was 
defended, but I was not defended. 
So they arrested you. 

Yes, I was arrested and instantly interrogat- 
ed. But they didn't beat me, because at that 
time, even they .... 
Were afraid . . . . 

Then they put me in that enormous dun- 
geon, the Carceri Nuove of Turin. That was 
where I met Pistoi, because the prisoners 
kept going from cell to cell, even though 
it was prohibited. The cells were ten feet 
by sixteen, with bunks, and I lived there 
with thieves and such people. 
You were able to exchange ideas and make 
contacts .... 

A little, but we were waiting for the 
much-touted arrival of the liberators, we 
knew that the terrible war was coming to 
an end. But no sooner had I gotten out than

- you know what I did? The very next day, 
I took a small sheet of paper and a pencil, 
and I went into the countryside, far from 
home, far from everybody, and I started to 
draw, because I told myself: Art has to 
become the new message. 
But before that titne, 1943, had you already 
painted? 

I ought to vay that I had already gotten to 
know Matti Moreni [b. 1920, Pavia; painter 
who worked in an expressionist, figurative 
mode]. 

In what sense: his work or the man himself? 
As a painter and as a person. It was Moreni 
who told me: You have to make art. 
Where did you meet him? In Turin? 
Moreni was living in Turin. I met him when 
I went to a paint store. Then I joined the 
Galleria d'Arte La Bussola because Turin 
was a city where the art life was intense. 
Aside from the world of art, were you 
interested in anything else, say, music or 
literature? 

As a boy, I read Kafka, then I got to know 
Cesare Pavese [1908, Santo Stefano - 1950, 
Belbo; anti-Fascist writer] and Elio Vittori- 
ni [1908, Siracusa - 1966, Milan; anti- 
Fascist writer] - they were incredible. 
Through politics? 

No, always through art, even if Turin had 
a highly political side during the forties. 
How did you get to meet those people? 
I went to the bar frequented by Moreni and 
I listened to him, my mouth gaping. I heard 
a man who was older than I. So was Luigi 
Spazzapan [1889, Gradisca - 1958, Turin; 
painter who worked in an expressionist 
style combined with elements of realism, 
associated with the group I sei pittori di 
Torino]. That sense of art as intensity .... 
Then I remember that my mother got me 
to read Kafka. She said: This is a book you 
ought to read. 

So your parents were, very educated and 
open-minded . . . . 

Especially my mother. My father was 
educated in his profession. I recall that at 
most he had read D'Annunzio. He regurgi- 
tated his cultural background - not Nazi but 
Swiss German. I remember my father 
listening to Hitler's speeches on the radio 
and yelling back. When he listened to him, 
he was sure that Hitler was already dead, 
that Mussolini was already dead, that all of 
them were dead. 
How come? 



He was an Anglophile, he loved Anglo- 
American culture. He said that the Anglo- 
Americans were potentially stronger, so he 
was certain the Nazis and Fascists had lost. 
That was why he was on the opposite side, 
in the most technical sense of the term. In 
fact, when the first bombs were dropped on 
Turin, he said to me, "You see? I told you 
there was nothing we could do." My father 
was an engineer, an aeronautics designer, 
and he knew that the Anglo-American 
countries had a decisive technological supe- 
riority over the Nazis. The Nazis had the 
superiority of national emotions, but when 
the "nation" fell apart technologically, 
Germany and Italy could no longer hold 
out. 

What about your mother? 
She was against the Fascists, because she 
sided with culture. My mother was against 
D'Annunzio, while my father was for him. 
She was against D'Annunzio and for Kafka, 
and so she got me to read him. My mother 
isn't Jewish, but she got me to read Kafka, 
because in Turin, the cultural system was 
determined by the publisher, Libreria Ei- 
naudi, and I reacf all the books they 
published. I went to the seashore, to 
Rapallo, and there, one of my friends 
pointed out Ezra Pound; he was sitting in 
a cafe surrounded by women and men, an 
elderly gentleman with a white beard. Then 
I read Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, 
Pavese 's Paesi tuoi, and Montale's Ossi di 
seppia [Eugenio Montale, 1894, Genoa 
- 1981, Milan; anti-Fascist poet associated 
with the literary current Ermetismo]. 
So, as a boy .... 

I was already familiar with world literature. 
And you were deeply involved with it. 
Yes, but I was very emotional, and like all 
emotional people, I was unable immediate- 
ly to structure the thing logically and in 
terms of an overall education. Instead, I was 
simply fascinated. 

But you associated with poets and artists, 
while your personal readings were extremely 
advanced compared with your school 
curricula .... 

I also had a teacher of Italian and art 
history, a priest - he knew Giampiero Bona, 
he was a friend of the Bona family and 
Felice Casorati [1893, Novara - 1963, 
Turin; Magic Realist artist] and Morandi. 
His name was Fra Pontino. He was an 
extraordinary man, who had known Picasso

and Braque, and so he informed me about 
all sorts of cosmopolitan things. 
Your education was incredible for that 
period. 

And how! It was totally different from what 
came after. When the war got hold of me, 
and I was sent to prison for a year, I 
experienced the very opposite of my school- 
ing. Instead of openness and free circula- 
tion, I experienced more violent methods. 
Were you already painting? 
I had begun painting at home. I had gotten 
to know Moreni and, above all, Fra Ponti- 
ne I liked him, and I thought I could 
become a painter. I was fascinated by the 
speed of painting as the idea of a possible 
attack on reality, rather than literature, 
which seemed far slower in its processes, 
including its linguistic processes. 
Hence, it seemed more difficult to 
implement .... 

It was like telling a boy: Painting can be 
done from one day to the next. And that's 
what it was all about. I did my first 
drawing. I tried to do a drawing in which 
the line would take over the entire surface 
rather than constituting a negative /positive 
relationship. 
In what way? 

The line taking over the entire surface is 
distantly related to my present-day igloos. 
The surface is worked by the line so that 
the line occupies it fully, like the moon. The 
drawing is a total fact, dictated by a need 
to exist rather than a need to represent - or 
else representing in such an exclusive sense 
as to become a mode of existence. That was 
why I headed for the countryside right after 
the war and began to draw with my pencil 
on wrinkled paper. Those drawings cap- 
tured the idea or grass and leaves, the idea 
of the wind on grass and leaves, and the idea 
that they were a medley, an "impasto." 
They were exemplary drawings, inspired 
perhaps by my reading extremely emotional 
and new texts, like Kafka's writings. Since 
they came from a different and remote 
world, there was no problem of repeating 
his work here, but my drawings had to be 
as strong here as his work had been there. 
That was the lesson I learned from certain 
texts, and I believe that Moreni too had the 
same goals during that period. But his 
ambitions were frustrated because he felt he 
had to be informal, absolutely informal. It 
had to be the most perfectly informal 



message, while that idea never even crossed 

my mind .... 

How did you get to La Bussola, and what 

did you show there? 

Luigi Carluccio [1911, Calimera - 1981, 

Sao Paulo; art historian and critic] was 

there, he was an extremely intelligent man 

with a very free mind, unshackled by rules. 

During the fifties, he suggested that La 

Bussola mount a show of young artists in 

Turin. 

What did you show at La Bussola? 

I had done Gypsy Wagon (Carrozzone) in 

1953. Its side was the right or left side of 

a Gypsy wagon. That's why I titled it Gypsy 

Wagon. 

Was it photographed or painted? 

It was painted, but it looks like a photo. 

It's an odd painting. 

When did you meet Pistoi? 

We were in prison together, and when he 

got out, he joined L'Unitd [daily of the 

Communist Party of Italy], he got into 

journalism. At that time, L'Unitd was the 

largest newspaper, while La Stampa [Turin 

daily] was shut down. La Stampa appeared 

again several years later, with an image of 

Fiat and Vittorio Valletta [president of Fiat 

from the 1950s to the 1970s], with the 

image - let's say - of ultraconservatism and 

the capitalist reconstruction of Europe. 

That was the moment when Pistoi joined 

L'Unitd as a journalist and published my 

drawings - I think, in 1949. 

Have you always used very dense materials 

like the ones in Gypsy Wagon? 

I did paintings that had elemental power 

and yet were thoroughly refined. I was 

against Art Informel. I recall a session with 

Ennio Morlotti [b. 1910, Lecco; painter 

who worked in naturalistic Informel style, 

in 1952 belonged to group Otto pittori 

italiani] and Moreni at a cafe on Piazza 

Castello [a central meeting place in Turin]. 

I came out as absolutely opposed to the 

Informel, because they thought they were 

exporting Milan's informalism and Moreni 

believed he was the bearer of Turin's 

informalism. They were the "Parisians" of 

Informel. 

Yet your themes were naturalistic, for 

instance, leaves and trees .... 

No. The leaf had become a symbol, the 

symbol of the organic whole. In line with 

that, Gypsy Wagon symbolized a form of 

anarchism. 



Did you hear a great deal about anarchism 
and Existentialism? Were you acquainted 
with Sartre's world? 

I don't know, because Sartre's world was 
considered a world of societal relations. My 
relations were with individuals, which I 
now see in terms of the Veda. The igloo 
brought out the Buddhist side of Giap [Vo 
Nguyen Giap, 1912-1975; North Vietna- 
mese military strategist and political leader], 
not the militaristic side. 
Sitting in the field . . . . 
Yes, but with a weapon in hand, not just 
contemplating. 

Let's talk about time again. Is it true that 
you did your paintings over and over again? 
It's just as true today, because you can never 
be sure .... 

The work can always evolve or be integrated 
in tbe present moment, like the yellow- 
brown angular structure, the bundles of 
twigs and the Fibonacci series. 
I believe that we can put literature into 
painting just as the Byzantines did. The 
ancient Arabs succeeded in doing so - 
writing became painting. This has been 
repeated today in American graffiti. For me, 
drawing is writing, and this phenomenon 
of painting-writing was something that I 
felt very deeply. 

Are you talking about the years 1953 
through 1957, when your writing was filled 
with color and figures? 
It is writing - naturally without an extreme 
awareness of that term. It is a light inter- 
weaving of dreams and material, yet this 
blending of things created the beauty of 
those paintings rather than ugliness. If you 
see Morlotti's paintings today, they look 
dusty and dated; they are period pieces, 
while the Gyspy Wagon painting is not 
trapped in any era. In 1953, I suddenly 
began doing paintings like The Welder (II 
saldatore), because I was always going out 
at night, and I was struck by the blow- 
torches of the rail welders. I told myself: 
Why not paint them? Instead of flowers, 
I'll paint a welder holding a blowtorch. So 
I did about ten paintings, but then I grew 
tired of the theme - I don't remember why. 
Were you still in Turin in the late sixties, 
or somewhere else? 

I traveled very often. I went on long bicycle 
trips, and I was always preoccupied with 
art. During those tours, I painted a mill in 
Lanzo. Around that time, I met a lung

patient who was locked up in a kind of 
hospital for the criminally insane, and he 
introduced me to Ezra Pound. Turin was 
a strange world, and I must say that Ezra 
Pound is poetically involved in my work 
to a high degree. Lots of my ideas come 
from him. 

Was it Pinot Gattizio [1902, Alba - 1964, 
Alba; painter involved with Situationist 
group and Bauhaus Imagistes with Jorn and 
Constant] who introduced you to the Cobra 
group, to Appel and Jorn? 
Not really. Gallizio was very possessive 
- that was his big failing. He was so 
possessive that he remained alone. He was 
very generous, but also very possessive. 
Actually, I got more information through 
the international magazines on Pollock. I 
found him very powerful and more impor- 
tant because he was less overblown. 
That's clear I 

It's clear now, but it wasn't clear at the time. 
The Situationists said: "We're the ones who 
are making things advance." They went to 
Paris, they went here and there. If you see 
Pollock, it's Boccioni, whereas if you see 
Appel, you see a degeneration from the late 
Picasso, a surface existentialism. 



How did you get to know Marisa? 
I met her in the late fifties. Then we went 
to Switzerland. 

In 1962, Car la Lonzi [1931, Florence 
- 1982, Milan; art historian and critic, 
author of Autoritratta, 1969, the first collec- 
tion of dialogues with such artists as Paolini, 
Fabro, Pascali, Kounellis and Twombly], in 
the introduction to the catalogue for your 
show at Le Notizie, talks about the way you 
stand out and about your solitude, and she 
also writes that many of your works have 
been destroyed. 

Well, she talks about it in a grandiloquent 
way, whereas for me, it was something very 
concrete, and not at all grandiloquent. If I 
see the painting that my mother owns, it 
is a very strange painting, it has a sense of 
electronics ana pulsation, not of the figure, 
but rather of a flux. 

So then you worked in Switzerland for a 
while? 

I went to Switzerland and I did paintings 
that involved very natural drawing. That is 
where the twigs come from. 
They have the same rugged, graphic quali- 
ties. Moreover, you didn't use much color, 
and if you did use any, it was never loud. 



Then it became more Baroque, as in your 
1962 show in Turin. 

In that show, the sense of isolation was 
transformed into pleasure. 
In the early sixties, Turin was a city on the 
move. I remember that in 1963 La Galatea 
showed Bacon and Max Ernst - all its artists 
were big names, with great economic impor- 
tance. It was a jewelry shop - you had to 
ring the buzzer to be let in and received. 
Next to it, there was II Punto with Gian 
Enzo Sperone [director of a gallery located 
first in Turin, then in Rome and New York] 
and Pastori. 

The latter were already established. Pisto- 
letto was already in a solid position, and 
they were all very suspicious of one anoth- 
er, partly because Gian Maria Persano had 
bought one of my paintings, and Pistoletto 
had criticized him. He was doing his 
mirrors, and his dealer was Ileana Sonna- 
bend. That was the period in which Turin 
was moving towards internationalism. 
When did you first get your studio on Via 
Santa Giulia in Turin? 
It was after I moved to Switzerland with 
Marisa. Next, we rented a house in Pisa - it 
was infested with mosquitoes - a big house, 
where I could paint; and that was where 
I did the painting that I put on top of my 
car - I drove it to La Promotrice [Societa 
Promotrice delle Belli Arti di Torino, active 
since the second half of the nineteenth 
century], I showed there with Pistoi, Lucio 
Fontana [1899, Rosario di Santa Fe - 1968, 
Comabbio; painter who made space his 
subject matter and executed slashed canva- 
ses] and Gallizio, but my piece wasn't 
accepted by the others. I couldn't get it off 
the car roof, so I told myself: "This is no 
way to transport a painting!" 
Did you use pigments or impastos of 
material? 

No. It was the spiral. 
The vertical spiral? 

The spiraling of color, the one I executed 
afterwards with numbers. It was done with 
pigments, very dense, enormous - gigantic. 
I had bought up all the tubes of paint in 
Pisa and Viareggio, and I put all the 
pigments on the canvas. It was totally crazy. 
/ recall that in the Santa Giulia studio, there 
was a room with the jutting paintings, 
burned wicker and neon light, and there was 
another room - my memory's hazy on this 
point .... There were objects by either you

or Marisa. They were made of bamboo and 
fishnets. Were those your works? 
Yes. They were done in a studio that I had 
near the Porta Nuova [main railroad station 
in Turin]. 

So that was a transition between the canva- 
ses and the jutting pictures? 
In 1963-64 Sperone had very powerful 
international connections; Lichtenstein and 
Warhol had come with him from America. 
As for me, in 1965-66, I invented neon 
- that is to say, it was an invention for me. 
Speaking of the jutting paintings traversed 
by neon, I see them today as tents that, if 
brought from the wall to the ground, become 
triangular igloos. At the same time, I 
associate the neon fire with the welder's 
blow-torch - it's a highly potent image, 
which perforates the material, just as the 
neon perforates the canvas and then the 
objects. 

I have always looked for a passage through 
painting, and I am still looking for it today. 
It is a transverse passage, like an airplane 
charging into a cloud and then flying 
through another and yet another. Next it 
crosses a space above America, a space 
above Greenland, a space above South 
America, and finally it lands in Australia. 
That is painting. For me, a painting is not 
as Carlo Maria Mariani [painter who uses 
Neoclassical iconograph, associated with 
Citazionista group] sees it: he wants to take 
on the whole human condition in an 
all-encompassing manner. And I'm not like 
Sandro Chia, who perceives painting as if 
it were something secure, to be done. I have 
always regarded painting as total insecurity, 
and not at all as a type of secure or accepted 
language. But as a form of insecurity that 
a person traverses. On the other hand, it's 
not like the overblown painting of the 
Americans or the facile historicism of the 
Italians. 

Do you think that this security, which is tied 
to faith by a truth, depends on historical 
legacy or on the culture of the ruling class? 
I have not really taken on the historical 
legacy of the Italians, because, basically, I'm 
not one hundred percent Italian. I was 
fascinated by that legacy, but not over- 
whelmed, I did not believe that the idea of 
painting is that of history. Even today, 
when I go to museums, I enjoy seeing de 
Chirico make fun of painting, just as Ensor 
and Rembrandt make fun of it. I actually 



stop before gigantic obstacles like the 
Raphaels and Titians, and the paintings 
they did. In my opinion, they did those 
paintings after challenging everything else. 
Picasso and Matisse did both painting and 
nonpainting. 

Are you saying that all avant-garde move- 
ments are a struggle with painting? 
A never-ending struggle, an effort to get 
through it. Once you succeed in getting 
across, then you invent the igloo. You enter 
the cloud, you pass through it, and then the 
possibility of making the igloo explodes, 
and then you enter another cloud, and so 
on and so forth. 

/ find the same analogy in the bamboo 
works: a flux oj framed elements. 
I see all my output of 1950 almost like 
premedieval painting, from an era in which 
painting, for the medieval world, meant 
entering a cloud, entering religion, at any 
price - painting was forgotten. Today, I'm 
not after big painting. An artist can go back 
to Art Informel or the eighteenth century, 
like Mariani. But it's all nonsense, because 
actually, you're entering a cloud that 
doesn't exist. 
It's an artificial problem. 
Completely artificial. It gives you a feeling 
of artifice, which the Americans absorbed 
in their formalistic culture. Nonetheless, 
when I visited the Tate Gallery, I saw those 
facile graffiti artists, who immediately con- 
demned Schnabel to becoming a master 
after a year or two. It's ridiculous: a man 
is condemned to being a master when he's 
really looking for something entirely 
different. 

They bury him immediately. 
They destroy you. Keith Haring and his ilk 
are laughable, they derive from Klee .... 
Yet they bury any desire to create, they bury 
Schnabel's desire to redo the great French 
sculpture .... 
And Gaudi .... 

By going back, Jasper Johns tried to reach 
Seurat. He's an American Seurat - that's his 
idea. 

Are you saying that such speed destroys 
them? 

Onlv twenty paintings are left, but you can't 
hold out. Works survive only as a desire 
for a transition and as an ability to get 
through those hazy clouds. You remain 
freer there, and you can do your work. 
You can't be branded, which is what the 



informational structure aims at. We said 
before that the anarchistic attitude allows 
us to move. 

I had a lot of experiences like that. Not for 
private reasons, but for art's sake. In my 
opinion art is the only thing that allows us 
to get through things and to be a process 
of traversing rather than an arrival. 
Otherwise, people remain frozen and rigid. 
From time to time, you may reach a shore, 
but the voyage continues, and it's wonder- 
ful. You arrive here, then there. . . . It's 
fantastic. It takes a long time, but that's the 
way it is. We may not have the keys to all 
the doors, like the seventeenth-century 
organists in Germany, or the Italian singers 
and the great Catholicism of that same era. 
Let's go back to 1967. How did you get from 
the jutting paintings to the igloo? 
I was bored to death by the angles of those 
jutting paintings - and then the Giap idea 
came to me. It had no angles. Giap writing 
had no angles, and the igloo came out of 
it. The igloo as the idea of nonangularity. 
The angle was gone. 

There were also rigid objects: the igloo is 
not rigid, it is circular, like the earth. But 
I remember the chamber pot and the 
drinking glass crossed by neon. There was 
a feeling of being unable to stop on anything. 
That's it. 

Everything was slightly elusive. The neon 
threaded, sewed, cut, served to clean the 
studio, to burn it, to melt everything togeth- 
er. It was not very different from the 
paintings in which all the colors melted 
together - it was the same approach. A large 
fishing rod with all the elements inside one 
another. The bamboo keeps returning . . . 
and the igloo becomes .... 
A perfection of that way of perceiving and 
thinking. 

Everything moves along with the work. It 
is neither rough nor dry. It has an incredibly 
intense sensuality. 

After the igloo, I began to think that I could 
do paintings again, because I needed to 
return to a self-willed possession not only 
of the intensity, but also of something acute. 
This is the moment of returning and 
resuming .... 

Yes. All those people coming from New 
York and demanding representation - it 
sort of reminds me or the representation in 
Baroque music, when the stories of Eurydi- 
ce or the Barber of Seville turned into 



51 



completely musical stories. You don't know 
whether it's one music or another. 
You can cover the whole range. During the 
return, anything can happen. 
That's why it's dangerous. So as a reaction, 
I thought of numbers and tables. Something 
tragic - a person caught in a tragedy. 
With regard to the objects that were in your 
studio during that period - did you find 
them in the street? 

I actually found them by means of a sort 
of selection. Every so often, I made a big 
find - for instance, the empty wine bottle 
traversed by neon. It was something of an 
invention - that emerging spurt of wine 
represented by light instead of painting. 
Rather than painting that spurt, I empha- 
sized the effect of explosion and flight. It 
became very sensual, Dut also non sensual, 
because it was reduced to a line. 
Was that why you painted your red objects, 
like the lance ana the neon? 
Yes, I painted the lance. What the bottle 
now lacks is persuasiveness. I ought to find 
a second chapter - from sculpture to 
painting. I was very tempted to turn the 
igloos and those objects into paintings. I felt 
tney could be reduced to paintings. 
Like the tables? 

Exactly. But it's very difficult, because 
you're again faced with the problem of 
painting, and thereby with representation 
with the problem of a fixed image. That was 
why I produced the works with real fruit. 
The invention of the discarded thing that 
is nevertheless there and has a smell. There 
is something anguishing and extremely 
sensual. The anguish of discovery and the 
sense of uselessness, the sense of both 
well-being and malaise. It may have been 
the most philosophical stage of my work, 
but it was useless for art because when I 
did the show at Sperone in New York in 
1982 - Sperone only likes paintings and 
nothing else - he said: "Great, wonderful. 
But two days later, there's nothing left." 
Throughout the 1970s, along with your 
tables and igloos, which occupy large archi- 
tectural volumes, you started painting again. 
You used enormous masses of colors in spiral 
shapes as well as progressions of objects or 
natural elements. What was the source of 
that need to pass into a two-dimensional 
plane or to recover an image from the color 
of the natural object? Was it perhaps an urge 
to render the table surfaces in color? If 



memory serves me, your first use of color on 
your objects, aside from the early lances and 
several neons, was in Berlin. It was on the 
progression of tables exhibited at the Haus 
am Liitzowplatz in 1973. 
I used bandages for the Berlin tables. My 
idea was to employ the elastic bands used 
for bandages. They were about four inches 
high, and the numbers were sprayed on 
them in colors. I constructed the space for 
1, for 1, for 2, for 3, for 5, and so on, and 
they became very long. They served to 
represent the dimension of the development 
or the numbers - those applied to the tables 
as well as those shown on the walls. I did 
the same thing in Minneapolis in 1972. 
So those were gauze paintings, long horizon- 
tal pictures? 

That's right, and I use that same format 
even today, but I increase the height. The 
work was done on tables, across the table- 
tops. The first paintings were done like that, 
on and with the table. Since a table is a 
specific size for one person, two by two feet, 
I decided to paint a red square, two by two 
feet for one person or two by two for two 
people, for three, for five. There was no 
room for the surface of the object; so I 
painted the surface, making it become a 
table for fifty-five people. It was a huge, 
colored surface, ana the development of the 
mass of color made it real. 
Let's focus on the theme of color. At a 
certain point during an earlier interview, 
you spoke to me about red as a sign linked 
to wine. Not coincidentally, you painted a 
sequence of drinking glasses on a table. Is 
red linked to a natural entity, aside from fire 
and lightning? Is it also wine? 
I would say that red contains them all, 
because it is an intense, yet symbolic color, 
which is so energetic that a red table on a 
white canvas is extremely aggressive. It 
holds together the content of the size and 
the content of the expansion of the tables, 
while assuming and defining the energy 
charge. Next, I thought of painting the cups 
for one person, the cups for two people, 
three, five, eight, etc., and little by little, the 
work took shape not only symbolically by 
way of the red and its expansion, but also 
as a thingly vision of a concrete event. 
Naturally, I even thought of the pictorial 
table in Antiquity: the table where they 
consumed the sacred meal was a place for 
a qualification of an event. The soup plate 



was more than a still life, it was the basin 
for creating the ritual meal. My paintings 
have a wine red background, so that the 
passage from the soup plate to the table is 
a ritual rather than a still life. 
Does the passage from the rigid and thingly 
table to the painting-table also involve the 
problem of keeping open the natural growth 
of the surfaces? In Arte ambiente [at the 
XXXVII Biennale di Venezia, 1976, organ- 
ized by Germano Celant], they were knead- 
ed into a brick wall and became the wall 
by means of the painterly and "naturalist" 
elements of sulfur and verdigris. 
The work in the Venice pavilion, reduced 
to its architectural essence - the raw surface 
of the bricks - was phantasmagorical. The 
color of the sulfur and the verdigris, sprayed 
directly on the red clay of the bricks, had 
become almost an atomic imprint - sprayed 
and not painted. During that period, I liked 
using this technique of spraying enamel or 
pigment on surfaces, because this procedure 
made for a faster execution, and tne greater 
speed turned the imprint into more of a 
pnantasm - as in graffiti - more phantasma- 
gorical, rather than being a painting in the 
traditional sense. 

In the paintings of the fifties and sixties, the 
color was built up vertically, in layers of 
material that weighed down on the surface. 
In contrast, you moved on to a surface 
quality that emerged from the lighter and 
airier material of the spray paint. 
The spraying creates a lightness and also an 
intense expansion of the painting rather 
than delicate shadings of sfumato. In Ven- 
ice, it became an almost fantastic imprint. 
That is the reason why you include fragile 
materials, like leaves or snail snells, scotch 
tape or mud, in drawings and paintings. The 
entire painted surface became fragile in the 
paintings you started doing around 1977 . 
I felt the need to negate the assumption that 

Eainting was something self-contained, I 
ad to emphasize that its exact contents 
were the tables and objects surrounding it. 
For instance, the leaf applied to the spiral 
had the fragile look of a seed inserted into 
a spiral, which is stronger than the seed 
itself, so that the spiral closes and extends 
the leaf. It is very easy to crush a leaf on 
paper or canvas with scotch tape and not 
waste any time on overly abstract topics. 
The leaf becomes mentally lucid again. The 
other day, when I was strolling through a

garden, I saw leaves on the ground, and 
instead of forming a landscape, they became 
mounted stones. They attained a brightness 
in their isolation and a meaning in their 
transience. Ultimately, the outlines of the 
leaves had the superb qualities of cut-out 
silhouettes. 

Thai 's where your paintings become animals 
with their paws on the ground. They are 
figures that expand below, at the front, and 
on the sides. They emit sticks or pieces of 
wood; hence, they walk in reality, in 
architecture and in space. 
Beyond tying them to the ground, I see my 
paintings crawl up the wall. They promptly 
turn into a creeping crocodile or lizard. 
They are the gecko that hovers on the wall, 
the gecko with its perfect anatomical equi- 
librium. I very much want the canvas to 
creep about, rather than being placed on the 
wall in a decorative sense. And since, for 
me, the crocodile is a mythically enlarged 
gecko, it can represent painting. The canvas 
becomes a gecko, and vice versa, and they 
both creep along the wall. 
In some cases, however, it becomes a real 
animal with several paws, like at the Moder- 
na Museet in Stockholm, where one of your 
paintings has a body with a metallic struc- 
ture and wooden paws. What does this 
intensification of the vitality and movement 
of painting signify? 

I feel that we once again have to see 
paintings in their context. When we see a 
Titian painting reproduced in a book, it is 
never presented in its original context. 
Then, when we see the real painting, we 
find it inside an architectural space, with a 
piece of furniture or in an arch. It is 
superbly inserted into a definite and concre- 
te space. Now, my paintings and sculpture 
try to carry within themselves something of 
the environment in which I made them: for 
example, for the igloo at the Moderna 
Museet in Stockholm in 1983, I used from 
the port in Stockholm bundles of sticks, a 
metal parallelepiped - thev are all elements 
that recall the feeling of that city. Further- 
more, the inclusion of cords or stucco, trees 
or trunks, which are tied to the painting, 
reminds us that painting is a thingly pro- 
cess, not subject to photographic consump- 
tion. It requires a space, and that is why 
I often mount paintings inside my igloos. 
They are very large walls, extended with 
very swift pictorial formulas, like spray 



paint or vast stretches of color that soak 
into the canvas, making it thick and intense- 
ly autonomous. I almost never prepare the 
canvas, I let it soak up the paint, so that 
the canvas absorbs the priming rather than 
being its support. 

Your paintings can be very long, measuring 
as much as dozens of yards. Do you think 
of them as walls, even attaching objects and 
elements such as a raincoat or an oar to 
them? 

In a certain sense, yes. In fact, the canvas 
that is a crocodile is penetrated by a neon 
lance, as if a luminous projectile were 
entering its body. The light transfixing it 
becomes either a symbolic fact (death) or a 
symbolic indication of the quality of the 
canvas, whose transparency is nourished by 
the light. A light meant as color and 
painting. 

The same use of color recently appeared on 
the igloo, which used to be colorless and 
admitted only the tautological color of the 
elements employed, such as stucco, glass, 
cloth, clay, the blue of the fluorescent 
tube . . . the igloo never used to be painted. 
The igloo functions as a moldable hemi- 
sphere, transparent and luminous. It may 
contain another igloo (the most recent one 
is the Cologne igloo, which is covered with 
phosphorus). This creates a highly lumi- 
nous intermediary space, becoming a study 
of transparency and light, like a gorgeous 
ampule from Murano or certain ancient 
glass vessels. If you think of the ice igloo, 
it is not only a masterpiece of architecture, 
it is also a masterpiece of extraordinary 
luminosity. Moreover, for me, the igloo is 
an object contrasting with the cut of the 
right angle, which always creates shadows 
and is extremely violent. In the igloo, the 
shadows vanish with the darkness, and we 
see a color reflection hundreds of degrees 
wide. 

Your igloo at the Centre Pompidou in Paris 
was neither transparent nor luminous, it was 
completely painted over, it could be entered 
and it was accessible to the public. 
Yes, because I had painted it in terms of 
a tent. I wanted it to be a tent and remain 
a hemisphere, while evoking the model of 
a mythical tent. That was why I painted it. 
I covered it with cones, their tips pointing 
down, and with a figure that was in between 
an object in space and an object that cuts 
into it, between the tree and the soul of the

tree, its gist. A spatial object, which, I feel, 
can stand in the air without any support, 
and that is how these objects become 
mysterious. They don't need to keep re- 
membering that man, who stands with his 
feet on the ground and his head in the air, 
can also do the opposite. This is the 
symbolism of spatial positions, which today 
are basically natural. We know very well 
that we have our antipodes elsewhere, they 
have their feet upside down. We know that 
there are men who have been able to 
circumnavigate the earth .... This absence 
of weight is a goal of my representation. 
What about animals like the crocodile, the 
tiger, the bison, the stag, bodies present in 
some of your Fibonacci works - why do they 
have a personal rather than a natural 
coloration? They almost become the transpo- 
sition of your personal participation or of a 
reinvention that, since it doesn't have the 
weight of color, can therefore give a different 
weight to these images. 
These figures are mythical, not domestic. 
But I was interested in having a crocodile 
at home, and not just a crocodile skin. I 
wanted a painted crocodile, a slightly unset- 
tling image and presence: the presence of 
a ghost rather than of a skin. These animals 
made me feel light in life, because they have 
something ancient about them, a sense of 
the unknown, of unavailability as far as I 
am concerned. They are absolutely solitary 
creatures, they do not participate in the 
collective life of the street. The animals are 
all those things combined. 
Hence their association with branches and 
dried trees. In fact, they always depend on 
this extremely harsh, arid, desiccated nature 
as if there were a sensory coherence between 
the animal and these parts of nature. What 
is the reason behind these adjacencies? 
The twigs represent our everyday life. 
Several bundles of twigs together achieve 
a furious shadow: sometimes I've put them 
in the mountains - those desiccated woods, 
and together they almost seem to be wait- 
ing. They are extraordinarily evocative of 
an astronomical voyage, and even if they 
derive their meditative quality from an 
agricultural landscape, the mountains - 
they become more astral in the work, they 
turn into sculpture, between the living and 
the dead, they are neither sculpture nor 
nonsculpture. They are both living and dead 
at once, they are exceedingly bizarre. 



Among your animals and your creatures 
with rigid bodies, you frequently include a 
rhinoceros. 

The rhinoceros is an animal that is a drama 
in itself, it wears a shell, an armor, yet it 
can move rapidly. It's both a robot and an 
animal at the same time. I once saw a 
rhinoceros, and it looked strange, as if mud 
were attached to its shell. I couldn't tell 
whether its shell was shiny or muddy; it 
looked as if it were both at once, it was both 
shiny and muddy. It seemed to be of both 
the earth and the water, and it had a sense 
of bones, in that a bone is a bone emerging 
from the mud. I did paintings of this strange 
animal, using clods of earth as color. 
Why did you penetrate them with neon, that 
is, an arrow of light? 

The arrow is a very luminous element, and 
light can cross through anything. If you 
read a book on physics, you know that all 
bodies are traversed by other bodies. So, for 
me, neon crossing through a canvas or an 
image is always referring to that scientific 
situation of which we are fundamentally 
carriers: we know that all bodies are 
traversed by other bodies. 
And that's why you put certain materials on 
the canvases? I remember stucco, palm trees, 
numbers, leaves, chestnuts, pinecones .... 
Rather than stucco, I always put mud or 
earth or things with which I could revitalize 
an image on the canvases. In this sense, the 
clumps of earth can be thought of in musical 
terms and not just visual terms. 
Are these elements musical notations? 
They are groups of notes, and the image is 
revitalized from one to the other. Often, my 
starting a canvas depends on the possibility 
of rendering ensembles, sort of like building 
walls With lots of bricks. You can conceive 
of putting bricks in the air, so that they can 
stay up by themselves. 
And how did the faces of leaves or pine- 
cones get into the picture? 
The faces are levels. There is the level of 
the eyes. There is the elevator of the nose, 
there is the cavity of the mouth .... This 
is a building with its floors, roof and stairs. 
Architecture is always contaminated by the 
mutual penetration of objects. Does the 
same thing happen in your paintings with 
tables and the hamper? 
Not only in my paintings, but also in my 
igloos. The fact that I have put one igloo 
on top of another is also a painterly image.

You feel that the human brain rolls up 
inside a skull, you can therefore glimpse it 
and assess it, like the intestines. If you could 
X-ray the human body mythically rather 
than scientifically, it would be extremely 
complex and have an extreme psychological 
weight. Such is the igloo in painting. 
The subject of Anatomy Lesson (Lezione di 
anatomia), with its interlacing of tables, 
twigs and the painting of a body, thus 
constitutes an oblique cut between painting 
and sculpture? 

In my work, the cut acquires a theatrical 
and cinematic meaning, it becomes a drama. 
That is why I sometimes indulge in the 
luxury of speed, so that I can be very 
fantastic in the cut itself. Thus, if you see 
bundles of twigs in a group, they become 
people, a crowd, they become presences that 
could not otherwise be re-created. Or at 
least, I aimed at re-creating them with this 
powerfully dramatic system. 
Then you're interested in presenting the 
crowd of paintings at the same time as the 
crowd of materials .... 
If you want to talk about crowds, I can go 
back to the igloo. When you see broken 
glass by itself, it is a strange element, inert 
and a bit annoying, because it recalls 
destruction. But if shards of broken glass 
start running one after another across the 
surface of the igloo, they acquire a strange 
lightness and strange obsessiveness. They 
lose the sense of the fallen, the falling and 
the broken. Instead, they acquire a meaning 
of strange forms that are always very 
bizarre, because they take on the form of 
brokenness. The form of brokenness put 
together with other forms of brokenness 
creates this surface, which is shiny rather 
than chaotic. It's like seeing the earth from 
very high up. Its chaos becomes more 
intense and takes on the meaning of its 
surface. 

In your latest shows at the Galleria Stein 
in Turin and the Israel Museum, the igloos 
of cloth or mud had spatial forms on their 
surfaces, comingfrom a different dimension. 
They were in fact cut out of metal and 
painted. What did their presence mean? 
Recently, I became intrigued by certain 
elementary themes of contemporary music. 
I would say that I am interested in an 
almost nonexistent music, somewhere be- 
tween rock and electronic music. However, 
it exists in my mind. These forms are 



variations on that theme. They are cut out 
and painted as if they were flying pianos 
with white and black keys, which brings the 
sense of rhythm into the igloo. 
Does the surface of the igloo become a 
musical score? 

Yes, one that's visual. But more than 
anything, it evokes musicality, like a plum- 
age of white and black. It's as if a piano had 
feathers instead of keys, as if a bird were 
a kind of mythical piano, so that music gets 
involved in painting in a nontraditional 
way. Instead of being all music, it becomes 
a painted music, and instead of being 
painting, it becomes a painting that is also 
musicaL

A very long Sunday 
has been going on 
approximately since 1966 
ana this is 1976 

We are reaching the end of the 
afternoon of a very long Sunday. 
We have never worked! For almost 
ten years, all we have done is think 
about spending a very long Sunday 
between two immense ana gray work 
weeks that weigh us down before 
and perhaps after. Before 1966 did 
it seem to us that we all worked more 
or less and after? Afterwards, it 
appears to us that we have to work. 
(According to the rules of living 
in our century.) 

We feel (on Sundays how we feel!) 
that we are not working. This 
consciousness makes us become 
slightly demonic, while we are such 
men during this very long Sunday. 

Throughout our very long years 
of Sunday, they appear to our slow 
but solemn memories, they can appear 
to us; and, inadequately and a bit 
angrily, the faces and discourses of 
those who watched us work appear 
to our slow but solemn memories. 
The critics, the art dealers and, 
secondarily, the people who pay a 
little something, the collectors - they 
appear to and disappear from our 
slow but slightly angry gestures 
of boredom. We were not working, 
while when thev appear (rarely), 
we think that they think that we 
are working, for culture, and hence 
for ourselves for them and for that 
which culture slowlv reveals. Instead, 
we are stripping culture in order 
to see what it is made of. But this 
stripping takes forever, and this 
makes us remain in this very long 
Sunday, precisely to strip culture 
in order to see what it is made of. 
However, this stripping never ends!... 
And this stripping is truly ridiculous, 
although truly (let us say so) 
necessary. 

Around 1968 (we barely remember 
during this never ending Sunday), we 
made an igloo with soil upon it and 
the soil was carved - or rather, not 
so much carved with a headstone as 
illuminated! The victorious political 
invective for the people of Viet - if 
the enemy masses his forces, he loses 
ground; if he scatters, he loses 
strength - we contemplated this 
irreversible dynamic idea, and we 
ignited it (with neon!), so that it 
wouldn't slip from our memory 
during our long Sunday. They won. 

We discovered that culture is 
stripped and makes us see the war 
of liberation of an intelligent general 



who savs: If the enemv masses his 
forces, he loses ground, if he scatters, 
he loses strength. But it is the 
common people who say why it is 
the common people who dip their 
dirty fingers into the rice paddy and 
into the space that they are given to 
live in, an immense space! A country! 
They call it "their" country. 

Down there in 1968, the sentence 
that was illuminated because it was 
irreversible was ignited. What a long 
Sunday! At dawn the announcement 
of war and its subsequent 
verification, but what a verification! 
For us, it is Sunday. We have had 
the pleasure of selling this product 
to our collector friend. 

We are here to strip culture and 
every so often culture gives us its 
current themes by way of wars, and 
focuses on numbers to make sure 
they are truly alive and swift, how 
many kilometers have we covered on 
this terrible Sunday without work! 
Because we have never worked and 
are never conscious - we have 
always and only continued to exist in 
order to announce that no one could 
work very well in this eternal joy 
of war and of general work. The 
accumulation of newspapers! 
And of numbers! 

We toured foreign countries a bit, 
smoking a few stubs which were 
shameful here and not proper there 
(but almost even there for those who 
work). Naturally we brought our 
Communist ideas there too, but no 
one there gave a damn about them, 
because there many people do not 
work on a workday. And this 
demonstrates that our Sunday is very 
long even in space. We abandoned 
our very long Sunday hands, our 
space /time drowsiness over New 
York, etc., etc. 

Now antipathy is universal. Many 
artists tremble when throwing their 
colors on the canvas and we do not, 
we think we do not, but culture 
appears to us in light and stripped or 
clad in light the way the archangels 
appeared to Dante. We can therefore 
construct works in which culture 
appears and then disappears. 
This is our desperation. 

It appears to us and then disappears 
and we barely have time (speedily) 
to have a work constructed or to 
construct it ourselves. (During 
our Sunday!) it appears and then 
disappears. Does it leave traces? In 
our opinion, yes, it leaves dreadful 
traces, like a fiery angel, it burns. 

But a Sunday! 

What a burning there can be on 



Sunday if not a misfortune! 

The angel who works burns 
the product on workdays, not on 
Sundays. Sundays bring misfortunes 
like wars and the accumulation 
of ludicrous products. 

What antipathy for us poor people 
who endure such a long Sunday! 

Our super-labor is rewarded 
in symbols. 

When we immerse our hands in 
a unique and encompassing work, 
to strip a culture it is made up only 
of excesses and sediments, therefore 
to the sight and touch, chaos! To 
the real touch something exceeds 
something does not reveal itself. But 
this is filth! What exceeds and cedes 
here on a Sunday: to construct as 
is done. 

We have worked with the products 
of other men. That is why we have 
worked with diverse cultures. That 
is why we have continued to live 
on Sunday. 

Because, they say, cultures are, 
we say that cultures exceed and 
disappear that is why they are not 
eternal, except in memory, or in the 
energy of meanings whether before 
or after. During is the meaning. 
And therefore Sunday. 

On Sunday culture strips off cultures 
of work and appears solemnly 
immersed in the filth of its inertia. 

And we strip it (an attempt) while 
it returns to the filth real chaos 
of detritus of so many values - a 
culture of workaday works. Were 
we frank with one another? 

First came chaos, then work, then 
the chaos of work, then chaos was 
stripped of work! 

We are almost all Marxists because 
of the attitude that says: Marx saw 
this elementary process — chaos being 
stripped of work. 

This is not a symbolic stripping. 

We witnessed all this on Sunday - 
culture is a Sunday thing for people 
who work. 

We witnessed all this. Symbols are 
nothing but filth. 

Try with the seashell or earthshell, 
it seems symbolic to the culture on 
the nonexistent (to history!), but 
it is not a symbol of filth. It is filth. 

Therefore with us, symbols can be 
tranquil in terms of their reality and 
identity, symbols are always made 
of filth or they quickly return to filth 
even when they raise their crest. 



We know that a house is filth unless 
it is workaday culture, our Sunday 
continues to lull cultures in their sad 
but real identity with the earth. This 
is what art has always tried to do 
and has done (on Sunday) for those 
who view a symbol as a pretext that 
will drag them outside of this. 

What is this? Filth, naturally on a 
Sunday. On a workday, filth becomes 
an object. Consumption has its job 
to do.

I worked on my first igloo during 
the year 1967. The diameter of the 
igloo was two meters [six and 
a half feet] long. 

Next, the diameter of the igloo was 
lengthened to three meters [ten feet]. 
Then, in the following years, the 
diameter grew to four meters 
[thirteen and a half feet] and 
six meters [twenty feet]. 
This igloo is five meters [sixteen and 
a half feet] in diameter; it is made 
of aluminum pipes, so that it can 
easily be flown out of Italy. 
The size of the diameters reveals 
form structure dimension and 
measure, a humanly correct measure. 
In the man sitting in the interior 
of this capsule as if to experience 
thought, the diameter size - although 
initially correct - of two meters 
indicates the way in which art, or 
the work that it aims at, has its sole 
support in itself. The work and 
the measure are second nature; hence, 
they are structure and support. 
Structure is its own support. The 
small building, the master of space, 
an atom of space, supports itself in 
space, creates its own interior out 
of itself by being a measure of human 
space, and creates the exterior out 
of itself: it creates external space by 
being the measure of an internal 
space. 

IGLOO = HOUSE 

The "optimum" of the "residence" 
of the object is man's house. The 
thermometer for measuring the 
behavior of the object in regard to 
itself is whether the object resides in 
the house, or whether it is rejected 
from there, partly or completely 
rejected. 



In that case, the object lives outside 
the house, remaining in the 
circulation of abandoned objects. 
Unsold newspapers are objects that 
are immediately rejected, for 
economic reasons. Meaningful objects 
that shoot from the hour of the new 
edition of the bequest. 
The object rejected by society, 
the outdated object, the unsold 
newspaper - it becomes art. 
Art boasts that it can absorb rejected 
bodies into its own body. Because of 
enigma, because of history, because 
of the nature of the body, because 
of alchemy, the bodily grandeur 
of rejected bodies is the desire 
to harvest and to cause to grow 
- a desire that is art. 
Art grows the way rejected bodies, 
rejected things, rejected objects grow. 
To the point of exhaustion of the 
process of making a body with art, 
many newspapers have to come and 
live in art, as many newspapers 
as possible. The mathematical series 
harvests countability, the greatness of 
the increase of the number following 
the mass social rejection of the 
object. 

The Fibonacci numbers, the series 
that is complete unto itself from the 
very start and runs towards infinity 
in a nonstop process liberates the 
mortified weight of the abandoned 
object. 

Thus, it is possible to recognize in 
the words "OBJET CACHE-TOI!" 
[OBJECT, CONCEAL YOURSELF!] the 
twofold value of the very BEING and 
NONBEING of objects. The object is. 
The object conceals itself beneath the 
lines of numbers, it changes value, 
changes sign, liberates its own 
defenselessness.

If nature is nature 

what are we, what is art? 

Is nature perhaps the GROWTH 

of cells in sophisticated 

complicated antinomies, 

like incredibly complicated 

drawings? 

So where can art be if nature already 

coincides with 

complication, complications 

incredibly more provocative 

than any complications organized 

by artistic expression? 

I try to simplify - I keep 

complication on the margins 

complication is present in any case 

in nature itself - 

COURAGE is a simplification 

of nature. 

Courage in Romanticism is the 

antithesis that opposes the 

thesis that is nature and its terrible 

complication, and 

courage is its antithesis. 

The waterfall reminds me of birth, 

eternal snow, the silence of apparent 

immobility. 

But aesthetic theories that respond to 

the demand for simplification taking 

into account the actual impossibility 

of simplifying and therefore giving 

free rein to the taste for symbolism 

are romantic theories. They are the 

symbols (which are always 

simplifications) of that which is 

romantically simple and that which 

is romantically complicated. 

An example of the former: the egg; 

of the latter: the tempest; and, in art 

history, an example of the former: 

painting; of the latter; music; and 

if we could only pass through the 

entire history of Romanticism from 

Plato for the former to tragedy 

for the latter.

The Fibonacci numbers expand in an 
accelerated manner, they inspired my 
idea that it was possible to represent 
with new faculties all the examples 
that occur in the world of expanding 
materials viewed also as vital living 
lives. 

Hence living materials that exhibit 
rapid and controllable expansion. 
The numbers are thus joined to 
reality; neither the numbers nor 
reality is dominant in that in the idea 
of this representative art two things 
have to be independent even if 
superimposed. 

A fabulous example of independence 
and superimposition is to be found 
in the Fibonacci study of the birth 
of rabbits according to the Fibonacci 
series, or, of Fibonacci numbers 
superimposed as on a fantastic 
and realistic screen to the growth 
of rabbits. 

Numbers are a relative extension 
of the body through the five fingers. 
Relative in that they exclude the 
psychological but not the 
physiological extension. 
A wall is a load (bricks, stones, lime, 
historical anxieties, psychological 
anxieties) the numbers unload it 
the way music unloads the chemical 
density of the atmosphere. Music 
too has mathematical or numerical 
equivalences. 

Time is a tap root immersed 
in the ground (the date of birth) 
time then develops in an objective 
and relatively free reality the way 
the tree develops from the tap root 
into the atmosphere. Time too is 



an anxiety that develops in only one 

direction, but it can logically double 

back with the sign - the way 

numbers can double back with the 

sign. 

The passage of light through certain 

holes and only through them 

is numerological. 

Ancient architecture was not left 

to chance, because it was not only 

a covering of space. 

What numerology lacks is narrative, 

but narrative is simply reality. 

Reality cannot be deformed. 

pp. 202-203 

The Fibonacci series published in 
Pisa in 1202 is basea on a very 
simple idea. Each number adds up or 
involves the preceding number in the 
formation of the following one. One 
plus zero 1 + = 1, hence: 1,1. Then 
one adds up with one to form two. 
And two adds up with one to form 
three. 

Written in sequence, this makes 1 1 
2 3. Then three adds up with two 
to form five. Five with three to form 
the number eight. Thus, the sequence 
extends, while rapidly widening like 
the growth of a living organism. 
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 ... . 
the end of this operation obviously 
does not exist .... 
but the microscopy of the dilation 
renews the organic ferment of 
development as proliferation. 
They pour space into a larger space, 
which is infinite space.

New York, April 1970 




When I think back to our first meeting, in 
Turin in 1966, I recall the violent impact 
of the neon light ripping and burning the 
canvases, the bamboo and the objects. Those 
were the days of Pop painting and Minimal- 
ist structures, everything seemed controlled 
and perfect - almost a monolith without 
wounds or corners. The emergence of your 
works with that cold but irregular flash of 
lightning - the neon tube - created a 
destructive gash in the monumentality of the 
art object. Was your aim critical or 
destructive? 

The neon work came into being as light or 
a bar of light or flow of light passing 
through the objects and destroying them in 
terms of the very idea of the object. I used 
neon to traverse the bottle in order to 
destroy the bottle, to turn the bottle into 
something else, which nevertheless remains 
a bottle and light. Prior to the bottle, I did 
canvases, which, in order to be seen, had 
to jut out from the wall. The neon, by 
traversing and piercing them, triggered a 
separation between the canvas and the light 
- that is, a concrete destruction of the 
canvas as the space of painting. 
Nevertheless, the jutting structures of 1964- 
65 are not primary, nor do they tend to 
destroy structure per se; they are painted 
jutting structures. Since they were painted, 
they had a meaning; they remained paint- 
ings, they were painting /sculptures, some- 
thing halfway between sculpture and paint- 
ing. Then I felt an urge to create a vertigo 
by means of painting. Something that came 
to me with drawings - that is, spaces that 
are closed and painted in a manner that is 
closed and yet open. For instance, if we look 
at color, the jutting structures were painted 
in terms of stripes or bands. The color 
escaped from or slipped out of a band and 
moved towards and across the next band, 
creating a rainlike form. In a rainfall, the 
water glides over a thing and then escapes 
to the next one. 

I now realized that by taking the structure 
itself, stretching the canvas and leaving it 
flat, without a painting, and piercing it with 
a neon tube, I produced the same form of 
vertigo, but in a different way, because the 
canvas was still pierced, although by light 
instead of color. The result was an intersec- 
tion of objects, with the goal of destroying 
the preceding object rather than creating a 
different one. 



Within these neon works, serial images 
were created - that is, a structure next to 
another structure produced a double paint- 
ing, which was unified by the single neon 
lignt. The neon light pierced the canvas, 
emerging from it and then reentering it, 
coming out again, crossing the empty space 
between the two paintings, entering the 
second one - and my idea was that this 
could continue. 

This was an idea that I then developed with 
the glass panes leaning against walls. In 
some of my exhibitions, I had as many as 
fifteen or twenty panes, if not more. The 
neon light leaned against the back of the 
glass; and here there was no more destruc- 
tion, because glass is a transparent structure 
- it does not exist, and it is even canceled 
out by repetition. All that remains is a 
sequence of light, created by the neon. That 
lea to the number, that is, the Fibonacci 
series. 

The Fibonacci [Leonardo da Pisa, known 
as Fibonacci, ca. 1170 - after 1240; monk 
and mathematician] idea was the idea of a 
numerical series that involved proliferation 
rather than a purely mathematical meaning: 
each succeeding number is always the sum 
of the two previous numbers. 
After the series of jutting paintings pierced 
by neon light, I put together bottles and 
other objects traversed by neon light. They 
represented a well-known physical reality: 
the bottle and - in the exhibition at L'Attico 
in Rome in 1969 - the car, the tree and other 
forms that are both familiar and unfamiliar 
at once. There were two panels in my 
studio, which you visited in 1967. One 
panel had wicker, a steel structure, a pillow 
and neon - and that same neon tube 
ultimately entered the objects, like the 
bottle, the chamber pot, the glass, the grape 
vine and the plants. My plan was to create 
a kind of thunderbolt that would enter 
objects. 

Another idea of transfixing involves the 
lance, which I executed in wood, painting 
it wine red. The "wine" theme is very 
important, it involves glasses and then 
tables; moreover, this too is a theme of 
transfixing. This is because wine represents 
energy that passes through the body and 
alters feelings and perceptions. Through 
these images of transfixing or piercing with 
various elements I arrived at the work in 
which I put together a plant in water with 



104 



a neon tube passing through the water. The 
meaning I achieved was that of luminescent 
electric current, visible, perceptible to the 
eye - a lance of light plunging through the 
water, the plant and the roots. Thus, the 
lance which, in my earliest objects, is 
painted wine red, becomes the image of the 
neon light - you can see the bottle in the 
clamp. Later the neon passes through the 
car, the glass, the bottle, and this entire 
transfixing is not an object - it is the power 
to say: "I think that in nature, the elements 
all crisscross one another." It was a kind 
of distance and, at the same time, a kind of 
proximity, rendering my idea of science. 
Science tells us that, in nature, the elements 
all pass into one another; the meaning of 
nature is transformation. This led to the 
idea of creating a sculpture that was not 
fixed, that was not geometric - a construc- 
tion that would be a transformation rather 
than a construction. Since neon light actual- 
ly has electric power as one of its own object 
qualities, it turns into light when it fully and 
perceptibly transfixes the glass object, that 
is, the tube. Piercing the car, the bottle, the 
glass, the water, or the plant with the neon 
tube meant physically carrying the action 
of transformation from one element to 
another. 

You've spoken to me about nonobjects, a 
term you even apply to recognizable objects 
such as a bottle, an engine part, a glass, and 
so on. Yet they are all negated as recogniza- 
ble entities — they are interwoven with one 
another and the neon light, they do not exist 
in reality. Hence, they are "abstract. " Why, 
then, do you paint them with unreal colors 
like that cold red? 

Precisely in order to eliminate the idea of 
the object-object, even if its color is that of 
wine, which makes you think of it as 
ultranatural. 

Do you mean so natural as to become 
illogical? 

Yes, indeed. Completely illogical and non- 
functional, so that, say, the raincoat I've 
worn that becomes a part of one of my 
works, no longer exists as a raincoat. A 
piece of wood is inserted into the two 
pockets of the raincoat, and the piece of 
wood is struck by neon light that is like an 
arrow. 

It was after the jutting paintings. One day 
(I think it was in 1966-67), I decided to 
have the same shape redone by a workman 



- not in wood, though, but in some kind 
of woven material. I exaggerated things, 
and I even had a handle done, because 
originally, I had told myself: the handle 
shouldn't be there, this has to be like a 
painting. Instead, I was now intent on 
exaggerating, and so I had the handle done, 
and it became an enormous basket hanging 
from the wall. After the huge basket, I did 
the cone - or rather had it done bv a 
workman, as an immense osier trunk. Then 
came the work made of grass, a very precise 
work, which I am now taking up again in 
certain drawings. This is not a reprise, 
however; it is really a continuation. In 
1945, at the end of the war, I was in prison 
for political reasons, and I did a portrait of 
another prisoner, a man with a huge red 
beard. I succeeded in doing the portrait in 
terms of hieroglyphics passing across his 
entire face — that was what enabled me to 
do it. At the time, the drawing had that 
significance. But now, in speaking about it, 
I describe it as a highly precise work, 
because I never once lifted the pencil from 
the paper. Today, I am doing the same kind 
of work in certain drawings. But, as I have 
said, they are not a reprise, they are a 
continuation. 

When I left prison, I went straight to the 
countryside to do some drawings of grass, 
the same way I did the portrait. But this 
time, I went outdoors in the morning and 
headed for the field. The period of drawing 
in the field was the period of marking, 
which continued from dawn to dusk, and 
with the same method: I never once re- 
moved the pencil from the paper. I stopped 
towards sundown, and the fact that I had 
spent all dav drawing that endlessly convo- 
luted line, like a tangle of intestines, and 
never lifted the pencil, allowed me to think. 
I had spent the whole day thinking, follow- 
ing my thoughts and evervthing happening 
around me - for example, the twittering 
birds, the falling leaves, the distant rumble 
of a van. All these things entered the 
drawing, not in a natural way, of course, 
but as time, as a recording, as if the pencil 
lead were the point of certain instruments 
registering on a sheet of paper: the point 
keeps rotating, it records the humidity, the 
temperature, the noises, the sounds. Actual- 
ly, it is never seen, but everything is in that 
point. Even if it isn't visible, it is entirely 
a passage of time. The significance for me 



was that I was able to continue doing those 
things for months on end. The fact that it 
eventually was impossible to go on is 
meaningless; for anything that is done can 
also come to a halt. The important thing is 
that it was done once; and for me, that was 
very important. I kept it up for perhaps a 
year or two, but chiefly during the summer 
months. I couldn't do it in the winter 
months, that is, during the bad weather, 
because it would have been meaningless, 
non-naturalistic. The crux of it was the 
physical and mental possibility of being in 
a place, the place of that grass. That 
interested me, because it was probably the 
same thing that was done afterwards. 
Then, my life became highly dynamic in 
that I had choices to make - these choices 
were very important in practical terms, 
because my father kept urging me to attend 
the university and decide on a career. I fled 
to Paris several times, out of my usual 
environment, and naturally these escapes 
interfered with my work. My choices were 
political - the act of going to Rome, for 
example, and doing things that had nothing 
to do with my previous work. It was all part 
of a social and political situation in my life 
at that time, and for years and years, I did 
no work. The recollection of that period 
would lead us far afield. So it makes no 
sense to talk about it. 
Are there any works from that period that 
you feel are connected with the present? It 
seems to me that your work has taken a 
unique direction - a kind of pencil meshing 
that contains and heats up all your activity. 
That's right. One summer during the 1940s, 
when I returned to Turin, I did poetry of 
a geometric nature, practically visual po- 
etry. It consisted of typewritten words at 
angles, which created a form of poetry, a 
very old work, done before the war, and 
now lost. When I did the igloo with Giap's 
phrases, I remembered that it was the same 
thing: writing Giap's sentences in neon was 
a commitment, but at the same time, it was 
like doing visual poetry. When a person is 
bored by too many words, he says: I'll write 
two words, on a typewriter, so they'll be 
comprehensible, very legible. It's no longer 
my handwriting, I write them in a very 
precise spatial dimension, which in the 
igloo is roundness, and in poetry - to the 
extent that they are on the same plane 
- means writing two words in one direction 



105 



and two in the other. The word imposed 
itself almost of its own accord, with the 
magnum force it could have in the social 
context, the context in which words are 
exchanged. All this is very important for my 
work: when language becomes a weight, 
when it becomes a number. 
I made the igloo for three overlapping 
reasons. First, in order to discard the jutting 
plane or the wall plane and create a space 
independent of the process of hanging 
things on the wall or nailing them to the 
wall and putting them on a table. Hence, 
the idea of the igloo as the idea of absolute 
and self-contained space: it is not modeled; 
it is a hemisphere placed on the ground. I 
wanted the hemisphere to be nongeometri- 
cal, so the hemispherical shape created by 
a metallic structure was covered with sacks 
or with shapeless pieces of material such as 
soil, clay or glass. Then I began the work 
of writing on this structure. I felt it was so 
important to be able to write in an absolute- 
ly static form like neon. Originally, it was 
the idea of a hemisphere covered with a 
natural weight like soil; then, a sentence of 
the same quality as the sentence written by 
Giap was written on the soil. "Se il nemico 
si concentra perde terreno se si disperde 
perdeforza" (If the enemy masses his forces, 
he loses ground; if he scatters, he loses 
strength). When I read that sentence, it 
dawned on me that it was talking about 
something essentially absolute, like war. In 
fact, it contained the word enemy, but in 
absolutely calculable terms, as a position. 
It was not the idea of the enemy as 
somebody whom one must move against; 
rather, the idea of the enemy in a dialectical 
situation that involves the person reading 
the words. This was very important for me; 
the idea of strength in an absolute sense was 
removed from strength itself. Strength be- 
came a dialectical quality in relation to the 
individual himself: this way of thinking is 
employed by Orientals, for whom physical 
meaning is absorbed by a mental idea, 
retained and maintained or, at times, aban- 
doned altogether. 

Is this the same situation as that involved 
in amalgamating the moving pencil with the 
landscape or grass, where the elements seem 
to fluctuate, suspended in space as they are, 
one inside the other? 

The result was a situation of suspension, 
in which I made the igloo, because the igloo 



itself is a situation in suspension, in that it 
is suspended as an object, and the materials 
themelves are suspended. Starting with the 
Giap igloo "Se il nemico si concentra . . . , " 
it was a moment of interest in what could 
be the meaning not of a word, but of a 
sentence: the specific meaning of the very 
gist of a thing. Then, during the May 
upheavals in Paris, some anonymous per- 
son wrote "solitaire solidaire" (solitary 
solidarity) on a wall. I was interested in the 
existential meaning of those two French 
adjectives placed side by side - they were 
important and, at the same time, they were 
suspended. I put them inside a material that 
would absorb a sentence. I went to buy 
some wax, I put the wax in a net, and on 
it I put that sentence, which did and did not 
melt in the wax, thereby remaining sus- 
pended. That is the meaning of this work. 
I did Sit-in because I had seen sit-ins both 
in photographs and in real life: people 
sitting on the ground within a given space. 
I planned to reproduce this image as an 
idea. In fact, this small iron structure with 
"sit-in" written in the wax had a meaning 
that had to do with the center of a space, 
which was the space in which the sit-in took 
place. The analogy was repeated when I 
wrote "albero fiorito" (flowering tree), 
mounting an idea in a precise space. The 
sit-in has to be very small, because it is a 
central point in which an event that is 
almost a calamity takes place. Next, in 
1968, I did the Hagoromo. 
But I'd like to talk about something else. 
At a certain point, I said: so much for that. 
I thought of concealing the object in an idea. 
The idea could counteract the object. We 
can say: we are against the objects we create. 
So then I covered the hemispherical object 
with soil and I made something that was 
somewhere between a cabin and the idea of 
the hemisphere. And over it, I wrote: "ohjet 
cache-toi" (object, conceal yourself)- It 
derives directly from a graffito written on 
the walls in Paris in May 1968. This is a 
second work based on the structure of the 
igloo. Then I did another igloo, at the 
Prospect exhibition in 1968. It's a very 
bizarre thing, because the idea came from 
a piece by my wife, Marisa. Marisa had 
made small lumps of cloth - cloth folded 
into itself in such a way as to become like 
a loaf of bread. We placed a large number 
of those small loaves on the hemisphere, 



and on it we wrote in neon "mat alzato 
pietra su pietra" (never has stone been 
raised on stone). This is a sort of admoni- 
tion to myself: bricklayers build houses, but 
I have never done so. I pretend to do some 
such thing by constructing those spheres 
with soil; however, I must say that this is 
a pretense, and that this was my statement 
about it. 

In 1968 you embarked on your existence as 
a nomadic artist seeking to construct his 
creative core in relation to the spaces and 
environments that are offered to you or that 
you manage to occupy. Could you talk about 
this continual precarious journey? 
In Amsterdam, for the Op Losse Schroeven 
show in 1969 I did a piece very close to the 
bread piece. The words "cittd irreale" 
(unreal city) were written on it. It means 
that the city is unreal, our cities are unreal 
and suspended in a vacuum. It is a huge 
triangle, each side of which is different from 
the others. Within this triangle, we see a 
filthy wax net with the words "cittd irreale" 
written on it in neon. At that same show 
in Amsterdam, there were leaning panes of 
glass on which I had drawn "che fare?" 
(what's to be done) in gigantic letters, using 
a blend of earth and oil. I did Che fare? 
twice: once in Amsterdam and once at 
L'Attico, in Rome, where I wrote it on a 
wall, again using that same blend of earth 
and oik There was a water faucet on the 
wall of the gallery, and I turned it on. The 
faucet, which emitted running water, was 
supposed to emphasize the significance of 
the water that escapes in relation to the 
phrase "che fare?" The work consisted of 
the relationship between the escaping water 
and the phrase "che fare?" - it was still 
another example of suspension. For me, 
"che fare?" was to be taken literally, not 
in its direct political thrust. Rather, it 
meant: what was to be done with the water; 
and hence, it was a question I was asking 
myself. 

The pieces in Rome and Amsterdam were 
done the same year that I did the works 
involving stucco and leaning panes of glass. 
In the leaning panes, the stucco raised the 
glass from the ground; at the same time, 
since the glass was leaning on the wall, the 
stucco created a soft organism between the 
glass resting on the ground and the glass 
leaning on the wall; hence, the glass was 
suspended in a shapeless material - the 



106 



59 Installation, Walker Art Center, 
Minneapolis, January 1972 




stucco. I used an abundant quantity of 
stucco, so that the glass remained inside an 
ideal protective material. I began to do the 
series of leaning panes at L'Attico. Then I 
used bundles of firewood, panes of glass 
and stucco - three materials contrasting 
absolutely with one another: for instance, 
if dry branches and glass are joined, they 
scrape against one another. Trie structure 
is supposed to create a possible space 
between these contrasting materials; stucco, 
glass, dry wood inspire me even today .... 
Those are three words that have nothing to 
do with one another. There were also panes 
of dusty glass, found at a glazier's; I framed 
them with stucco. Inside the stucco, they 
became a very heavy material, contrasting 
with the idea of glass, which is light and 
transparent. The light placed behind this set 
of panes softened the glass, and the light 
also seemed very distant. This created the 
sense of the distance that actually existed 
between the panes - a sequence of about 
fifteen, placed against one another with the 
stucco. In order to emerge, the light had to 
make an enormous effort. It was filtered by 
the panes, which were separated by dusty 
gaps as well as by stucco, so that they had 
a very heavy material in the interstices. 
In Rome I also took a box, and I poured 
wax inside it. Then I suspended the wax 
from a high structure. The meaning was the 
same as that of a nest in a tree - something 
incomprehensible, a piece of material aban- 
doned aloft. 

One of the works I did in Rome was a well 
made of glass panes and stucco, into which 
I had poured plaster. The plaster was then 
released into a triangular structure. I took 
it and propped it against a triangular iron 
structure. That was how I made the work 
consisting of the net with soil. In all the 
works of that period, the idea of "leaning" 
is very important. Everything leans on 
something else - that was a constant idea 
of mine. For me, writing leans on paper 
- that is to say, the paper is not intrinsic 
to the writing. Rather, the writing is 
propped against the paper, and that's why 
I am now doing proliferations of numbers. 
I feel that a number is propped against 
something, as if against a continuous wall. 
And if the number is propped, the wall is 
completely independent of what is propped 
against it. Intersection leaves one object on 
another without tying them together. In 



sculpture, for instance, when one object is 
placed inside another, the sculpture itself 
becomes a desire to construct and insert. 
But my sculptures are the exact opposite: 
they are made in order to affirm that a thing 
leans against another, even in an irrational 
manner. For example, in the plaster trian- 
gle, there's a piece of crude iron, which was 
made by a blacksmith, and there's a plaster 
sculpture leaning against it. And, like 
something leaning against an arm, it is not 
an absolute object, it is a relative object, in 
that the piece of plaster, which I took from 
another sculpture (the glass well), is 
propped against that thing. One feels the 
action of somebody who has brought this 
here, propped it against the other thing, and 
left it. It is propped, not abandoned. That 
was why I called the panes of glass against 
the wall Propped (Appoggiati) . The word 
"propped " is very important. 
There is darkness ana light in the piece 
entitled Wax and Rubber (Cera e gomma). 
The rubber was highly opaque. It created 
an embrasure, and from that embrasure 
another emerged, which was brightly lit by 
a lamp that was placed underneath. And 
then mere was the wax. Wax and Rubber 
is: dark with the goal of darkness, which 
is the rubber; dark with the goal of light, 
which is the passage from rubber to light; 
light with the goal of darkness, which is the 
passage from light to rubber; light with the 
goal of light, which is light per se. It is a 
curriculum vitae and at the same time a 
thing that returns to itself and does not 
emerge from itself. 

When I was in San Benedetto del Tronto, 
I went to the beach and I saw the footprints 
left by seagulls with three toes. I redid those 
imprints on a wall, carving them in with a 
hammer and chisel. I moved from the 
bottom to the top, making the imprints 
emerge from the window. This approach 
signified a passage of the environment into 
itself. I even added a small piece of paper 
with writing on it. 

// seems to me that in San Benedetto del 
Tronto you shifted your attention to "natu- 
ral traces, " as if the unreality of the city had 
pushed you towards the countryside to look 
for motifs that are linked more closely to the 
earth and its irregular growth. 
That's true. That was the period of my 
works involving poured wax. I was in the 
garden of a house and I noticed the space

between tree branches. It was absolutely 
immense compared with my normal idea of 
space. We're used to measuring space in 
meters or kilometers, according to our 
material situation. If we have to move from 
one room to another, we think of space in 
terms of meters. If we have to move from 
one city to another, we think of space in 
terms of kilometers. Hence, we possess a 
pre-fixed space. But in that garden, I found 
myself dealing with a space that was not 

E re-fixed, in that the interval between two 
ranches seemed absolutely nonmeasura- 
ble. I was unable to perceive it in metric 
terms. I then decided to calculate that space, 
and I measured it by making a calculation. 
I set up a canvas between two branches, and 
I poured liquid wax on it. The next day, 
the wax had hardened, so that when the 
canvas was removed and the branches were 
spread apart, this measurement of wax and 
space remained. Here too, we have the idea 
of leaning as the idea of the space between 
one thing and another thing leaning against 
it. It almost looks unreal, but actually, it 
is very real, because it can be physicalized, 
not calculated. The "casting" of the materi- 
al re-creates that space in slightly absurd 
terms. 

My use of the Fibonacci series began with 
the idea that it was impossible to stop inside 
any of those spaces. I put myself inside a 
contradiction between opposites - between 
emptv and full, between life and death, 
which is, I believe, the contradiction be- 
tween Mohammed and Buddha - the con- 
tradiction of man per se as a fact of life. 
These numbers do not so much cultivate the 
contradiction, as they absorb the idea of the 
contradiction; insofar as the numbers 5 in 
5 are repeated, they are vegetative and 
biologically natural, considering that they 
have a sort of father and mother who 
precede them and produce the subsequent 
offspring. Thus, these numbers often corre- 
spond to the proliferations of natural ele- 
ments and human elements: for instance, we 
have 5 fingers, 2 eyes, 1 nose - that is to 
say, we have, 1, 2, 5, and can easily 
recognize this number, which transcends 
itself in a divaricating sense. I did this series 
because it is biologically conceivable, be- 
cause it has a direction and, above all, roots, 
but it has roots, because it has a biological 
meaning, even if the meaning is not directly 
scientific. This series is not purely imagi- 



nary, but is used in computers, which was 
why I thought one could always create 
relationships with it. I derived drawings 
from it, which can be transposed from one 
thing to another within the same series. And 
that was why I made the Fibonacci igloo. 
I took pieces of iron, tied them together 
with joints; and, calculating the spaces with 
numbers, I constructed an igloo, the one in 
New York. Next, by using two leaning 
panes of glass, I enlarged the work. First, 
I took a pinecone and counted the circles 
down from the widest: the cone has 21 
pineseeds, two circles further down 13, two 
circles further down 8, two circles further 
down 5, two circles further down 3, two 
circles further down 2, and it ends with 1. 
It was like the series of Fibonacci numbers: 
21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1. 

At a certain point, the Fibonacci series 
entered architecture. When was that? 
That was at Konrad Fischer, in Diisseldorf, 
in 1970. I did a proliferation of the 
Fibonacci numbers on the wall, and it was 
absolutely arbitrary as a determination of 
spaces, but absolutely precise as a determi- 
nation of distances and relationships. I was 
using the wall in a practical way to show 
something that can come to an end. 
Next, I did the installation at Lambert in 
Milan. On the wall, some sort of module 
begins, and then we can see where it ends; 
and the wall is always an instrument to be 
leaned on. The written words "sciopero 
gene rale, azione politic a relativa proclamata 
relativamente all 'arte' (general strike, rela- 
tive political action proclaimed in relation 
to art) were a secondary work. They 
interested me because I wanted to put them 
in the bedroom of a person who would thus 
have a graffito that had nothing to do with 
his life. It was like a newspaper, the idea 
of a newspaper was overturned. When you 
read the newspaper in the morning, you see 
and you read what has happened in the 
world; thus, you have an overturned writ- 
ing. It is a work that I still have. I wanted 
to sell it only to a private individual, so that 
he could put it in his bedroom. Placing it 
in a bedroom has a significance for me, it 
strikes the nervous system as well as the 
mental system. During the 1970s, I did 
videotapes. The one I presented in Bologna 
was a work involving music. I hired a 
violinist, who played a violin, regulating his 
strokes and intervals according to the 



Fibonacci series: ping, a pause, ping, a 
pause, ping-ping, two pauses, and so forth. 
The second tape, which I did with Gerry 
Schum, involved a snail shell. It came about 
because I had once gotten hold of a snail, 
and, using a magnifying glass, I scrutinized 
the spaces in the spiral of the shell. Between 
the two tapes, I did the spiral in Krefeld. 
When I went to the Museum Haus Lange 
in Krefeld, I found myself in front of a 
marvelous building designed by Mies van 
der Rohe. I then thought about the possibil- 
ity of making an object relating directly and 
indirectly to that edifice. I didn't want to 
put an object inside, I wanted to make an 
object that would be entirely integrated 
with the building, yet would be the com- 
plete opposite of that building. However, 
the exhibition never came about. I only had 
the designs and plans, which then took 
shape in the book I did with Sperone. 
This project seemed to emerge from a 
love-hate relationship with spaces, a sort of 
intense relationship with the environment, 
which may be extremely congenial as in 
Krefeld, or unpleasant, as in New York. 
The New York panes, done on the Bowery, 
were actually about the intrinsic worth of 
the city. They contained writings - a series 
of threats. I can't remember all of them. 
Only the first four: ' 'L 'espace carre menace 
I'espace ronde?" (Does square space threat- 
en round space?), "L'espace ronde menace 
I'espace carre?" (Does round space threaten 
square space?), "On prefere voir la courbe 
ou I'imaginer?" (Do people prefer to see a 
curve or imagine it?) "Le projet alors est 
rond ou droit?" (Is the project then round 
or straight?). They were written sequential- 
ly on the panes of glass, and the sequence 
went on to include statements against space, 
the space of the city, which I had perceived 
as violent. I had begun to think of these 
writings in Krefeld, where I had done a 
piece, which is documented, starting with 
those threats. And maybe that was the 
reason they sent me packing. "Che cos'e una 
casa, e un'ombra sulla terra o una poco 
chiara frazione dello spazio?" (What is a 
house, is it a shadow on the ground or a 
not very bright fraction of space?). That was 
a threat against space. 
Where in architecture is there an infinite 
spiral that coincides with your work? 
Why, in New York, of course, at the 
Guggenheim in 1971. While the structure 



109 



was originally extremely heavy, it became 
very light, almost magical. The numbers 
leaning against the walls eventually expand, 
giving the impression that they are unen- 
ding. The spiral seems to suck away the 
interior of the museum. In fact, I say, "I 
think of numbers in a proliferating dilation; 
they are real, with the absurdity and 
lightness of idiocy." "This gives birth to the 
power of making walls light and crushing 
the proliferating numbers across the entire 
stream of the wall, so as to make the photos, 
paintings, mirrors, papers random. These 
numbers make the entire construction 
slightly idiotic; that is their horrible secret." 
In the Bowery piece, it is like a tale by Poe 
when I say: "This idea is equivalent to 
pouring water from a glass into the water 
of a river." "For my own security, I like 
to reduce to zero all the trouble caused by 
the objects and ideas that concern you using 
a maximum dilation." "Reading the num- 
bers and understanding how they dilate is 
a pleasure never to be stopped, and destroy- 
ing a space that empties into a larger space 
is a pleasure to be repeated forever." 
"Thought is expressed in spirals, in con- 
strictions and dilations, thought is certainly 
an unknown nucleus charged with opposite 
olarities that cannot be taken for anything 
ut calculus." "Is it a place to amass things 
or is it a place to conceal weapons or is it 
a place to receive elementary advice not to 
move?" These utterances were written in 
such a way that they started out feebly and 
eventually clashed with space. "Space is 
impracticable," "Space is round," "Space 
is intrinsically dynamic," "Space is against 
man today because man continues to turn 
space into a commodity," "Space doesn't 
give a shit about man, so long as man 
doesn't give a shit about space." That was 
written on the final pane. The statements 
were in French and English. 
As I told you, this work began in Krefeld, 
not with a series of threats, but with a visual 
threat. For me, the house was a marvelous 
object; so I made an ideal center of the 
house, and then, using a progression, I 
made a spiral - or rather, I wanted to make 
one. The spiral, meeting the walls, would 
have had to pass through them, ideally 
breaking them. I was unable to execute this 
project. But then, I developed it in a book 
and in a series of drawings. 
The snail work is the same thing, it is 



unthreatening, in that the snail is free, it is 
very tiny, and it has a little house with a 
spiral of the same size. I merely continued 
it on glass and I did the work for a 
videotape. 

On the other hand, in Tokyo, I did the 
proliferation with a plant. I went to a 
gardener and obtained a dwarf pine, which 
I brought to my space. Starting with the 
joints of the small branches of the dwarf 
pine, I constructed, with the same module, 
the Fibonacci proliferation on the wall, 
using the four sides of the room and 
referring back to the pine tree. The module 
corresponded to the module of the small 
plant as a space, and then there was a 
module in the wall in that the wall was 
covered with sheets of cement with holes 
in them. If there was enough space inside 
a hole, I inserted a small cylinder of wood 
on which I had twisted a rubber band that 
led to another space. 

// is certainly a highly Oriental piece, which 
seems to forget the concentration of the Gap 
igloo. 

I disagree. In fact, in New York, I wrote 
a sentence in English, which said: "The 
calculation-thought of Giap is an Oriental 
calculation-thought." It serves to cleanse 
the mind of the fears of inexperience. It 
makes man an expert, so that, in the depths 
of his brain, he can foresee the forces 
unleashed in macroscopic space. The Giap 
igloo serves to stabilize relations between 
forces. Then I go on to say: "The power 
of calculation is the cleansing of calculation, 
as, in the Fibonacci calculation-thought, the 
trail of its passage is exclusively its cleans- 
ing, its inconsistency with itself in that it 
is elementary." After the writing came the 
series. I also wanted to do a proliferation 
of these numbers in a space that was not 
empty, but filled with objects, so that there 
would be both the proliferation and the 
objects, the objects would remain in prolif- 
eration to the extent that proliferation 
existed. 

I wanted to implement this project in an 
office, so that the proliferation would have 
a meaning of both taking and abandoning, 
catalyzing all the objects inside. 
In fact, I say: "The object encountered by 
the progression halts in space without 
proliferating, only the progression prolifer- 
ates, the numbers proceed, their growth 
towards space and the object stops, innocu- 



ous, folded by the force of an elementary 
but infinite calculation." 
The thought is without images, the idea of 
these numbers is an intention without 
images; yet they succeed in becoming imag- 
es - an image of thought and not an image 
per se. Actually, it is not an image, in that 
they are propped against a preexisting 
image - the walls. Finally, I say: "In 1968, 
in Rome, I showed the calculation-thought 
of Giap in the form of an igloo, in which 
the calculation-thought referred to three- 
dimensional space. The dilating numbers 
and Giap's thought are experiences of 
relations." "This plant grows, the space of 
its growth flows into infinite time."

The presence of numbers is 
irremediable. The number itself is 
already in transformation through 
concepts of positive and negative that 
acquire the values of time and space. 
As ,i result, the number, given its 
striation which is sensitive to all 
innovations and transfers, acquires 
new fields ot observations and 
strange metamorphoses. 
The quantity and the velocity ot 



thought, the quantity of images 
superimposed without a mathematical 
rule but with a purely practical rule, 
that is, quantity as a natural number, 
is an arrival point of the avant-garde 
tradition to the extreme offshoots 
of body art. 

A quantity that uses itselt as in terms 
of speed, that is speed in a 
progressive proportion, acquires from 
die very quantity of cases that 



Qualify themselves, they do not lie 
own supine in quantity itself. 
An example of this technique of 
quantity is the photographing of 
people in a restaurant as a place for 
performing the action of satisfying 
alimentary needs in a numerical 
progression.

Watching the yellow river swollen 
with rain, watching it carry trunks 
and refuse, I saw books words 
impudent things drifting by, 
incredible baseless quarrels - 
in short, the things of life, gazes, 
irresponsibility, maniacalness; 
the things I did not see drift by, 
strangely enough, were paintings 
and sculptures. Yet I could also have 
seen other things carried on the river: 
tickets by Lawrence Weiner, empty 
bottles floating with their bottoms 
towards the sky, horses with bloated 
bellies, I did not see art drifting by, 
not even the ultimate art, certainly 
no upside-down Titians, I saw no 
upside-down Titians, nor any horses 
or empty bottles or tickets. Since all 
these "things" represented art and 
were therefore berthed in a safe place 
and were not only chimerically but 
also realistically, sociologically safe in 
a given place: the port of chimerical 
and real art. It is a place inside us. 
From there, I got the emotional 
but real contrast between art and 
literature. Literature is an object, 
the book, words, dispersing 
consciousness and reabsorbing it 
continually in the mind just as the 
mind contains the river and whatever 
the river carries. 

Art, on the other hand, contains the 
chimerical and tranquil place of calm, 
limpid waters, a state of grace. Art 
is the chimera, of the forward flight 
and the scattering flights of the hunt 
of fear of everything that goes and 
never returns, literature is born. Art 
uses things that go irresistibly, and 
it renews them with visible strings in 
sculptures works paintings in which 
we can find ourselves in the safe 
place of the chimera known as art. 
I mean, the shriek on the bridge is 
not emitted beyond the bridge and it 
goes with the river, but this remains 
present in a place that is there, I 
don't know where, but the object, 
the drawing has stopped it. This stop 
in a chimerical yet real place is the 
sole conquest of art. It is the sole 
and irreversible conquest of man: 
if man is chimerical, then in art he 
assumes the real aspect of the 
chimerical, he joins the chimerical, he 
dwells in it, even if his dwelling in it 
means having to submit to exhibiting 
in a museum, a palace or a garret. 
The place is not chimerical, it is 
literary, art is chimerical; placed 
anywhere, it can be left out. 
This is a declaration against the 
death of art. The death of literature 
sociologically involves the very form 
of literature. The weights of 
contemporary art are already 
employed at the place of the chimera, 
while the tempest enrages, literature 
is twisted and almost has no face, 
while the tempest enrages, the face 
of the twisting is methodically and 
irresistibly recomposed in the 
showcase of its support. Christ 
remained in the eyes not because 
of his literary quality but because 
of his ironic quality. He is present, 
from the confusion of death he 
too has taken distances across 
his iconographies.

The race for life (in art) is galloping 
across a heavy terrain. Everything 
has been done so that artists can 
be more or less pursued in acts of 
idiotic consumption of calculations 
by collectors. All the galleries 
without exception are consuming 
useless energy in this race towards 
artistic consumption, to cretinizing 
power. 

Art defends itself against forms with 
ideology the way life defends itself 
against repression with ideas. 
In the history of art I feel ridiculous 
I cannot exhibit my ridiculous 
works .... 



My opinion is to mediate on this 
ancient and present truth. 
The art galleries have little likelihood 
of representing the artist, just as the 
artist has little likelihood of 
representing reality. 
The asocial is the present situation 
of art, the asocial represents the 
unconscious for everyone the 
commercial representations do not 
maintain the asocial on the level 
of possible individuation so that 
I do not feel tied to any steady 
commercial representation.

The fruit is here! 

We do not genuflect and say: 

Thank the Lord! 

God has given this to us! 

Our ancestors said it. 

We say: 

The fruit is here! 

But we do not know 

where it comes from, 

where it comes from, 

the fruit. 

We do not know 

why the fruit is here! 

We think that the fruit 

is our property, 

then we get very suspicious. 

Perhaps the property 

of eating fruit 

is properly ours. 

But we do not know 

whether the fruit 



The fruit counters 

are grand 

then truckloads of fruit 

are dumped upon them. 

We suspect 

that the fruit is not in our hands 

if the fruit counters 

became palaces 

we would suspect 

that the palaces are ours! 

But we have deep suspicions 

about the ownership 

of the fruit. 

If the fruit spoils 

quickly in time, 

then we too will spoil 

in the long run; 

do we harbor suspicions 

about ourselves too? 

We are not properly 

fruit! 

Our palaces 



But the fruit 

is not ours! 

How can we suspect that something 

in the world 

is not ours? 

However, the fruit sellers 

seem to harbor 

deep suspicions 

about the ownership of the fruit. 

The passage of ownership 

is very speedy. 

Then we suddenly 

know something 

from which 

our suspicions 

are suddenly 

remote. 

The fruit is 

very beautiful.

A set of numbers is a house 

A tree occupies chiefly time. 

Two trees occupy the same time but 

a larger space. 

A forest occupies the same time and 

a large space. 

Space is time that can be eaten. 

The time of the falling of a fruit is 

Croportional to the size that the fruit 
as taken time to attain. 
In moments of reproduction animals 
are independent of animals of other 
species. Numbers in reproduction are 
independent of numbers in other 
classes. Numbers take on a 
proliferation force from distinct but 
connected unities like animals. 
One is one, one is one. 
Two is one encounter, a front. 
Three is an ensemble of the 
preceding encounter plus the solitary 
recovery of a distinct unity. 
Five is the front of the two unities 
plus the moment of recovery, and all 
this in a new ensemble. 
Thus this means that one, one, two, 
three, five, are in proliferation, they 
are alive, they are not an inert 
procession of unities. Following the 
process of proliferation leads to an 
antiparodistic vision of things, ;;nd 
hence to constructing houses. 
Becoming large (growing) is 
antiparodistic. 

A house is a grown product. 
Making a house is taking into 
account the proportion of growth. 
Making a house to meet the 



requirement of applying a limited 

order in the face of an unlimited 

disorder. 

Making a house in order to follow 

the will to survive. 

Making a house by negating natural 

space (it is in its requirement for 

growth). In everyday life a portion of 

the unknown is uncommunicable it is 

inside the house. 

Making a house is a proportion 

between a man and a squandering of 

nature. Do the numbers of the house 

relate to economic processes or to 

the space occupied by bodies and the 

years that lives occupy in time? 

Is a set of houses a moving chorale 

of detached pieces or does it in itself 

represent a totality? 

Are houses a sum of spaces or a 

living proliferation? 

The Fibonacci house is deliberately 

constructed on the numerical series 

of that name. 

The fact that it is deliberately 

constructed can be a merit or a defect 

according to architectural tradition. 

Mv intention is to apply the 

Fibonacci series as the succession of 

elementary numbers is applied with 

the linear measure. 

Art exists because of the need to 

apply a limited order in the face of 

an unlimited disorder. 

Architecture is the application of 

construction material in a place 

where it is appropriate for a group 

of people to live. 



The proportions of reality the mental 

disproportions occupy like drawings. 

Constructing a house is abandoning 

the idealistic disproportion of pure 

thought and accepting construction 

with the proportion from reality. 

Reality contains everything 

with the will to survive 

and 

the consciousness of negating 

the consciousness of the positive 

and the unknown which then acts 

like 

a product of the contemporary. 

Constructing is knowing the 

proportion between man and the 

squandering of material used by man. 

Using solar material. 

All space/ time proportions are 

correlated with the space occupied by 

the body and the years occupied by 

life in time. 

The house is a relationship between 

space and time. 

Time is a creator and destroyer of 

space. 

Space is not autonomous or static. 

Space is controlled by time. 

A tree occupies chiefly time. 

The fragrance of pines is a derivate 

of time. 

Eating a piece of fruit is eating time 

in a space. 

The time of the falling of a pinecone 

is proportional to the size that the 

pinecone has taken time to attain. 

Becoming large (growing) is the 

house, making the house is taking 



into account the proportions of 

growth in biological time. 

The artwork is the only source 

of money that I have for acquiring 

a sufficient amount for starting 

construction work. 

I construct in order to limit the 

automatic disorder of our way of life. 

To get to know less approximately 

my present real dissatisfactions. 

Constructing is above all an alert 

recognition of everyday life. 

It is different from the hedonistic 

material intrinsic to art, this real 

concrete and grossly differentiated 

material intrinsic to the construction 

of installation. In art the material 

comes from tradition. 

In order to construct one must 

frequently change the materials. 

Wood is the material of forests. 

Forests no longer exist. 

Wood must be canceled as a 

material. 

Glass is the laboratory material 

closest to the conditioned separation 

of spaces. 

Head and sight separated and united 

by glass. 

Only constructing today has the 

attraction of making art grow rather 

than reducing it to a symbol.

Today in the glorious park of fog 
Next to the nameless walls 
Cracked by insult 
And covered with the cover of light 

and fog 
The incandescent snail lives enclosed 

in its spiral! 
Violet lamp of nature my foot in 

space 
Covered with fog walks swiftly 
The solitary pinecone squeezes its 

pine seeds 
Into its tiny and perfect space! 
My walking foot squeezes its bones 
The way the solitary pinecone 

squeezes its pine seeds 
Into its tiny and perfect space 
In the inadmissible park attached to 

the ruins 
A glorious globe of fog 
The park squeezes the solitary 

pinecone 
In the park my solitary and human 

foot crunches 
It is a numbered ossuary of small 

things of bones 
Numbered and living 



Squeezed, the way a pinecone 

squeezes its strange pine seeds 
Thus, inside my foot my pine seeds 

of bone coexist 
In the glorious park of ruins and fog 
With the squeezed pine seeds of the 

solitary pinecone 
Here the crunching foot, there the 

silent pinecone 
I go back always to the snail, the 

incandescent snail of my brain 
Having made its spiral with a single 

total bone 
An ossified spiral shell, in order to 

be small and precise 
In the glorious globe of fog 
In the park the bidden incandescent 

snail of the brain 
Squeezes into the ossified spiral shell 
In order to be small and precise 
My human foot crunches in the park 
It is a numbered ossuary of small 

things of bones, squeezed into the 

foot.

Arte Povera, they say, has made it 
possible for commercial, technological 
and manufacturing materials to 
represent an artistic idea; it has 
destroyed or simply obfuscated a 
certain reduced quantity of artistic 
surface materials in order to restore 
to the surface the meaningtulness of 
destiny in a broad sense. For 
instance, Arte Povera has done away 
with the frame as a support in order 
to give value to the more elementary, 
but also more complex support of 
the immobility ol trie floor, of the 
field, or the vertical immobility of 
the wall made of bricks, stones or 
concrete. Arte Paver, i has taken hold 
of beams or trees. These alternative 
supports have liberated art from 
lixed programs, not in order to create 
new iconographies, but in order to 



free the feeling of art to probe 
between diverse and opposite realities 
rather than to close art or to enclose 
it in traditional supports, thereby 
reacquiring it; art has relationships 
with iconographies or amid 
iconographies. We cannot speak 
of relationships between 
Expressionisms, Goya, Pre-Raphaelite 
iconographies, Fauve iconographies, 
etc., etc. This marked sense of 
innovation does not protect art, it 
does not open it and fan it out, but 
it enables it every so often to probe 
amid realities, objects and languages 
destined for other values or other 
types of readings; for instance, 
Conceptual art is a probe amid 
printed words, luminous writing or 
notes written in a swift instinctive 
nervous calligraphy. 



Objects or natures very remote from 
being art, or artistic supports, gather 
together in the new art. 
A parallelepiped of iron pipe can 
become a frame for stretching a 
portable canvas, a heap of twigs 
brings into art the irremediable 
opacity of a product of the earth, 
because, in art, it is united with the 
irremediable luminosity of electric 
power. A canvas is an image swiftly 
sprayed in ten minutes of 
craftsmanship and not painting, it 
reveals the possibility of immersing 
this image, derived in whatever 
manner, in the probe that unites it 
with twigs and electric power, and 
views it as stages ot fleeting or 
permanent places to speak, stand, 
actors those images by alternate 
or concatenated musical scores. 



That is the art of today. 
This art is never a relationship 
between opposing iconographies, 
between oppositions like "turning a 

¥age" and "iconographic stabilities." 
he rapid images nave entered the 
dimension of this art in order to 
bring in the image and not the 
"painting" dedicated by other, more 
stable iconographies. 
It would be absurd to go through 
static and pictorial iconography with 
a lamp, but it is possible to carry a 
lamp through the very rapid image 
and yet ."as it comes, it comes," with 
a few seconds of making, because 
this is already part of the intuition of 
the passage across. 
This is wliat it is.

In the course of our dialogues, I have always 
thought of your igloo as the result of a 
linguistic nomadism, in which the shape of 
the hemisphere is posited as an artistic 
edifice to store the materials corning from 
the territory through which you have hap- 
pened to pass. For example, after your 
Zurich show, which included all your igloos, 
I felt I could perceive this form in various 
ways. It seems like a planet, located near 
other planets; and with its energy, it appears 
to attract all the linguistic meteors that orbit 
around it - both painting and sculpture, as 
well as opacity and transparency, calm and 
speed, artifice and nature. Thus, the form 
of the igloo is a terrestrial archetype that 
circles within your work and is capable of 
creating a fantastic and infinite constella- 
tion, in which the planets are made of sticks 
and glass, stucco and earth, cloth and wax. 
If the igloo is taken as a gravitational space, 
then I also see it as a constrained form - that 
is to say: once it becomes part of your work, 
it involves all possible sensations. It is also 
a stimulus for you, so that you can test 
yourself and explore the wealth of its 
chances of survival. It is as if you had 
invented it in order to confront yourself with 
your own eyes, which always have to see 
new and different images. Is the igloo a place 
of reflection in both senses: thinking and 
mirroring? Is it a place where you project 
images that come back to you as particular 
igloos, whose reproduction creates a galactic 
system or - as in Zurich - the Merz 
"village"? 

The thing that shapes it, the specific form 
of the sphere, inherently holds continua- 
tion. I tried to incorporate planes, and at 
a certain point, these planes called for a 
sphere. I also tried to include things that 
seemingly contrasted with the sphere, for 
instance, the famous clamps, which are 
bases, systems - they are not only connec- 
tion systems, but also propulsion systems. 
These thrusts ultimately wind up in the 
sphere itself. Hence, it is a system in motion 
rather than a fixed system. Just as the 
vertical and the horizontal - that is, the cube 
- tend exclusively towards self-reproduc- 
tion, so too the dome ultimately becomes 
a formula. It is a formula, but one that 
reflects light in a different way. Yet each 
light ray nas a different incidence. Every 
centimeter of the light ray falling here is 
ultimately reflected in a different way from 



that of the preceding one. Thus, not only 
the preceding one on the vertical, but also 
the preceding one on the horizontal. It is 
sort of like saying that you get to New York 
via the North Pole, because the polar route 
is easier, faster, and not because of the mere 
idea of the pole itself. Speed is of the 
essence. As a result of this meaning of 
speed, which is inserted into this type of 
work on the hemisphere, the materials are 
ultimately magnetized by the surface; and, 
being magnetized by the surface, they are 
not only taken by the surface, but virtually 
readjusted, so that they can act from the 
surface itself. The surface becomes a theatri- 
cal stage. I have seen extremely crude, really 
very crude lumps of soil on this hemisphere, 
ana they looked like highly sophisticated 
things. They seemed intentional, elegant. 
The elegance derives from the speed that the 
lump of soil gets from its position - it's the 
position that creates the movement. This 
position is extremely ancient. But while it 
may be a product of Antiquity, it is also a 
product of the modern era. Oddly enough, 
in this area ancient and modern converge, 
but I have found that certain surfaces 
- always the vertical or horizontal - need 
a historical definition, in architecture. Actu- 
ally, the hemisphere requires no historical 
definition, so that when we used tar on 
surfaces in the Berlin installation, it was 
almost natural. It's not like saying: Now 
I'm putting tar on this wall. The tar on this 
wall means that the wall has to support 
something else, which may even be antithet- 
ical to the wall itself. 
But there's no antithesis here. . . . 
There's no antithesis because the tar adapts 
almost voluntarily to this hemisphere. It 
undergoes strange contortions, but eventu- 
ally it becomes normal, reproducing itself 
in a similar movement. We proved this with 
the lumps of cloth made by Marisa, with 
the pieces of clay for the Giap Igloo, with 
the Berlin tar, with the Dusseldorf lead, 
with wax, with painting. 
// is this pure form that puts the malleable 
and external disorder in order, giving it a 
way of circulating. . . . 
It is the incidence of light on the surface. 
The surface is immediately animated on its 
rotundity, it is instantly animated in that the 
incidence of light, even the dimmest light, 
is immediately palpable. 
In an igloo, you take a pure form and start

Metal tubes, glass and twigs 

The process of creating the igloo was 

videotaped by Austrian radio-television. 



to accu?nulate a series of energy data, light 
data. But in Zurich there were a lot of 
spheres. How did you see that accumulation 
of igloos, all together? You suddenly saw 
that there were various densities of material 
and various speeds. How did you see this 
phenomenon, which you yourself produced? 
I saw that, for instance, in the hemisphere 
of twigs - the twigs were no longer those 
of a farmer's barn. This is an igloo made 
of twigs, but we are impressed by the fact 
that it instantly becomes like a house that 
transcends a house, because it is a spherical 
house. Hence the tension of the twigs and 
branches on the top, which then supports 
more, which in turn supports more. We end 
up with a series of arches that create the 
entire spherical tension, which is the ten- 
sion in a drop of water. We know that when 
a drop of water is struck by a far more 
powerful force, like perhaps that of a 
teaspoon, the drop escapes from the spoon, 
reforming as a hemisphere because of the 
surface tension. The surface tension of the 
molecule causes the drop to assume a 
specific form, rather than becoming a shape- 
less entity, and the ideal form is the 
spherical form. The same thing happens 
here. In Zurich, I saw this awesome igloo 
of twigs, that is, wood, trees, precisely 
because it was put into this form - which, 
however, is a form that the eye always 
reveals. The eye is never mistaken, it has 
an extremely powerful perception of this 
form, because it is a form that is flexible, 
crazy or meager, crazy or reductive, Ba- 
roque or reductive. In other words, it's 
intrinsically a highly classical measure. The 
measure is classical, and the eye perceives 
it; the material is anticlassical, the eye 
perceives the fusion of anticlassical material 
and a form that is not classical in the sense 
of classical architecture - but rather, it is 
classical in the sense of the human mentali- 
ty. The human mind is very close to the 
form of the sphere. Man has an intuitive 
consciousness of the sphere - a piece of 
fruit, a ball. It is an age-old intuitive form. 
Actually, it supports. I could make a gold 
igloo that supports. The gold igloo would 
support itself very well next to the wax 
igloo or the broken-glass igloo or the forest 
igloo. No two things seem more staggering- 
ly different than a sheet of gold and a surface 
of wood. Yet if the sheet of gold is placed 
in a position of tension on the hemisphere 



and if the wood is placed in a position of 
tension on the hemisphere, they have some- 
thing in common, which transcends the fact 
that the two materials are so distant from 
one another. 

Hence, the igloo maintains the classical form 
- which I would define as archetypal - and 
the material chaos, although in an equilibri- 
um; but where does this fluid whole origi- 
nate? In an atmospheric bombardment, 
perhaps, due to the place and the sensations 
of the moment? Where do your material 
meteorites come from? At the same time, 
there is a difference in scale, so that the New 
York igloo, which seemed enormous, has 
gradually gone down in size, and now it is 
shrunken compared with the twenty-foot 
igloo in Stuttgart or the forty-foot igloo in 
Bordeaux. What has changed in your atmo- 
spheric and territorial conditions? 
The atmospheric relationship is very pow- 
erful to the extent that it is allowed to exist. 
That kind of circumstance allows the atmo- 
spheric condition to exist rather than letting 
it remain purely a tension as an alternative 
to something that can be a form. Intrinsical- 
ly, it is a tension that allows even the most 
fragile thing to exist. The broken-glass piece 
is typical .... 

Or the soil of Jericho - it 's something almost 
impalpable because it's dust. . . . 
Those are things that have no power in 
themselves. On the other hand, I saw that 
as this igloo took shape with pieces of 
cracked and broken glass, with horrible 
jags, with sheets, streaks, hubbub - I would 
even say howls - those howls come to a 
stop, as if vou were watching the ocean 
from up high, the howling ocean. If you see 
it all around, then, at a certain point, it stops 
howling, it calms down into a mythical 
form, which is actually that of the earth. 
Do you then think that there is a dialogue 
between fragile and rigid? 
There is a dialogue between the extremely 
fragile and the archetype, which has tireless- 
ly permitted this flow of materials, for this 
is really a flow of materials. 
You feel it as a flow? 
Actually, rather than choosing the material, 
I find it, in a natural condition. At a certain 
point, the material itself wants to get up on 
that stage, that platform, that spherical 
form, for we have even thought that 
materials per se, opaque material and trans- 
parent material, are two extremes of a single 



180 



concept. That was why I wrote "chiaro/scu- 
ro" (light/dark), which is also found in the 
Buddhist canon: light and dark are not 
opposites, they intersect and probably rec- 
ognize one another. In such a condition, 
they recognize each other rather than declar- 
ing that they exist in a formal antithesis. I 
have the feeling that the true meaning of 
material is transformed the instant it is put 
in this condition. It is actually a material 
that flows rather than a material that fixedly 



covers. 



Your works also depend on being traversed 
by energy. Your igloo and your tables are 
always penetrated by other elements, which 
graze and disrupt their compactness and 
uniqueness. For instance, the hemisphere 
can be traversed by a painting or another 
igloo, by an automobile or a found object. 
It's as tf the light rays solidified, taking on 
the shape ana consistency of reality - an 
everyday reality or an artistic one. At times 
you create an incredible bond between an 
object and an animal, an edifice and a fragile 
form. Ultimately it all becomes a drop of 
water, through which all reflections pass 
without disrupting the surface or the shape. 
Everything lives in a highly sensitive 
equilibrium. 

You know, when you see it, I have to say 
that certain futuristic city designs by 
Sant'Elia were done according to the same 
system. There was a train in, let's call it, 
an aerodynamic form, which, at the level of, 
say, the third floor, passed through architec- 
tural forms. And this train, charging 
through architectural forms, was actually a 
dream - but it was a lucid dream. The 
design had this rational form traversed by 
a kind of luminous train, which was 
rendered by luminous numbers, but also by 
opaque rocks, and it was interrupted by 
things. The spectator's eye seemed to sense 
that the traversing would continue. Hence, 
the traversing of this "drop of water" made 
of glass ultimately became an almost virtual- 
ly mythical penetration. 
Then you don 't see an extension of the 
energy of the sphere; instead you see a visual 
arrow, which penetrates. 
Yes. In this case the important thing was 
the dimension of the street that traverses, 
the arrow that traverses, the ray, the laser 
beam, that traverses. I remember that in the 
famous church of Milan, which is no longer 
used as a church - it had four inches of dust 



on the floor - and we put up a glass igloo, 
in the dark, of course. Then we brought in 
a laser, and the laser beam went through 
that layer of dusty material, which was the 
church itself, and it went through that drop 
of water, which was the tarpaulin and the 
broken glass, in a truly mysterious way, 
because the traversing was not a traversing 
of, say, the laboratory, it was more the 
traversing of a thing that came before the 
laboratory, after the laboratory, during a 
remote catastrophe. Or else it seemed like 
something that could exist there, but that 
could also exist behind it, around it, it could 
be seen from different points of view. 
Hence, in its simplicity, it permitted both 
visual and mental reasoning - they were 
united. I find that this is the condition that 
allows these works to exist even ephemeral- 
ly - for we had to leave that church. We 
had the sense of the ephemeral, because the 
thing was truly ephemeral. But the power 
of vision was not ephemeral. It remains. 
At times the igloo and the table enter into 
a dialogue with very powerful architectural 
obstacles. I am referring to Tucci Russo 's 
columns in Turin or the Palacio de Cristal 
in Madrid, and now Bordeaux. How do you 
see this traversing, which you often produce 
subsequently, by intersecting the igloo with 
another object, such as the painting, which 
traditionally is hung vertically and never 
covered or integrated with anything else? 
In the case of the painted igloo in Turin, 
the painting placed across it functions as a 
challenge to painting per se, and, at the 
same time, as a challenge to painting as an 
object. Thus, there are two reciprocal 
challenges to be maintained in the same 
work. One is a real challenge, because it 
seems impossible for the painting to be 
related to a hemisphere, precisely because 
it is created on a flat surface. At the same 
time, the hemisphere is a challenge to 
painting because, at a certain point, it 
actually requires an atmosphere that can 
enclose a painting and keep it in vitro - in 
the glass. As a result, these are two 
challenges that, instead of canceling one 
another out, have remained in contact as 
challenges and have maintained the possi- 
bility of being seen as two highly emotional 
elements. The painting, rather than being 
suspended from a nail on the wall, ultimate- 
ly became part of an atmosphere that was 
very different from the one that the art of 



painting normally has and wants to have. 
Yet by using these highly fragile elements, 
you also need to anchor, or else to challenge, 
the architecture in which you place these 
elements. In Spain you confronted it with 
the column, which means that the igloo 
accepts the violence of the column. 
I would say that one can embrace a column. 
I would sav that one can again take up the 
image of the ocean, because the image of 
the ocean seen from a mythical height, 
above the earth, embraces a large amount 
of space in its curve. I realized that the 
object forming this hemisphere is vora- 
cious, rather than being an object that repels 
material, just as a wall normally repels 
material. In order to be able to avoid 
repelling material, the wall has to become 
almost a decoration. I would say that it has 
to become like an absorbent skin. In the 
case of the igloo, in the case of the 
hemisphere, the material usually placed on 
the hemisphere is involved in a movement 
of light and /or space, and hence modes of 
existence .... 

Which supports everything .... 
Which supports being at the mercy of this 
object. Instead of remaining virtually im- 
paled, crucified, it remains spread out on 
a bed, it remains propped, it remains in a 
more organic state. The thing I've always 
found awfully troublesome in the art of 
painting is the impalement of a pain- 
ting. . . . Only the greatest paintings man- 
age to transcend this feeling .... 
Of rigidity. 

Practically rigidity, crucifixion, which is 
part of every painting. In contrast, the 
meaning of a painting that traverses the 
igloo - or, in certain cases, a painting that 
is merely left to its own devices on the igloo 
- ultimately reaches a more organic state, 
hence a state that is less ill, less tense, less 
that of a sacrificial victim. Thus, there is less 
of a sacrifice here, less of a sense of sacrifice. 
Less of a rigor mortis .... 
One of the things that are absolutely 
necessary for me, I even would say vital, 
is this. I have always noted this terrible 
problem: art has a very high moral tension, 
yet it is this feeling of impiety in the very 
situation that provides a notable lag - I 
would say that it's kind of like reading 
poetry. Perhaps a poetry of the past, one 
that was sung - it had to be more 
organic .... 



181 



More magical. 
More magical, hence .... 
Hence, it has a mellow feeling, something 
ancient .... 

Ancient, yes, something that reading, for 
instance, always gives you the sense of. 
Even reading, precisely because it's a con- 
struction .... Look, these are sort of the 
conditions that have always attracted me. 
Instead of abandoning a certain culture in 
the form of the igloo, I have always been 
attracted, and in my attraction, I have 
always come to use intrinsic materials. 
Perhaps there was no need to make the gold 
sheet, because in reality, the light coat of 
tar ultimately becomes a sheet of gold. The 
broken glass ultimately becomes a sheet of 
gold. 

Yet in the course of time the form of your 
igloos has expanded. Originally you re- 
strained it, but now it contains more and 
more, to the point of dominating us. 
Yes. I woulcf say that there are two tactical 
approaches. One involves reappropriating 
the most geometrically felt form, and the 
other involves sentiment - I am again 
referring to the idea of the earth viewed 
from far away, which ultimately imparts a 
sense of organic spaces. What we experi- 
ence in the hardness of our earthly position 
has a certain distance, and the eye no longer 
perceives - instead it perceives the sense of 
the organic .... 

Yet how do you see the change, say, in the 
size of your igloos, your tables? Do you see 
that change as a natural process relating to 
spaces; or do you see it as a surface - let 's 
call it pictorial - an increasingly large, 
increasingly soft surface? 
I have the impression that by means of the 
hemispheres I am defending myself against 
largeness (because largeness per se is a 
terrifying thing) or smallness. 
Largeness or smallness - the tension to- 
wards the largest or the tension towards the 
smallest - those are two intrinsically terrify- 
ing phenomena. 

But when they are put in that condition, 
largeness loses its expansion pure and 
simple, becoming an expansion in itself. To 
value the small and the large - perhaps you 
put it most effectively today, saying that to 
value the small and the large becomes 
difficult because something that seemed 
large becomes smaller, something that 
seemed too large would become normal. 



Now, in Bordeaux, we see what will 
happen, because this will be a very large 
affair; and even as I hope to succeed in 
making this object, I have an intuition, I 
have the impression that I have to do it in 
such a way that it becomes a road - not 
veering across at a diagonal, but crossing 
the surface, a highway that runs across the 
surface, because, by crossing the surface, 
perhaps too large a surface, it ultimately 
reaches the verge of existence. 
How do you mean that? The road of material 
or ... . 

No, the road of objects, because I planned 
to use glass panes, drinking glasses, rather 
than making rays that come from a sun, as 
is done in depictions of the sun. In lieu of 
rays, you can imagine drinking glasses. 
Naturally, if used in a certain way, they can 
form an organic road. If misused, they may 
remain simply an expedient - say, a Dada 
device. But if they are used well, they could 
become the famous spring pouring into the 
other, the famous spring that keeps pouring 
and pouring ever afterwards. 
In other words, it would have to become a 
continuous movement. 
That's right, a continuous movement. 
What do you plan to do with regard to space? 
With regarcf to space, there are fannings- 
out. It will become a kind of orange. 
Imagine an orange that has very large 
sections and very tiny sections. This is a link 
with an internal architecture, which is 
different from spherical architecture. A link 
with internal architecture - I'm thinking of 
painting certain elements on the inside, so 
as to create a reading of the nucleus, too. 
Otherwise, the largeness would be slightly 
exasperating. You know, this problem is 
inherent not only in the sculptural or 
painterly object, but also in the architectural 
object - it's really a problem. I once talked 
about it with you, about what the architec- 
tural object is today - it has become merely 
an object of signification pure and simple, 
an indication of space, instead of an indica- 
tion of an internal space that can ultimately 
be seen on the outside. 
If I understand you correctly, you intend to 
create a wood or a forest of forms and 
elements in which the boundary is not 
defined, in ivhich the end cannot be seen. 
Everything is to be closed and interwoven, 
yet open and transparent - almost a dialec- 
tics of finite and infinite. This visual magma, 



traversed by swift forms and objects, by 
animal figures and igloos - what will it live 
on? 

Perhaps the thing that was the clearest in 
this sense was when there were elements 
inside one another, which is once again an 
appeal to the nonfinite. By making the finite 
an appeal to the nonfinite, in that man 
realizes what materials are inside his natural 
"habitus," which is actually the geological 
formation of the earth, he would be infinite- 
ly more content to live on a crust, because 
the mere fact of living on a crust is always 
an over-simplistic fact, while even a da 
Vinci vision of things, that idea of the 
interior of the body, is always something 
that creates a sense of the nonfinite, and 
thereby a sense of further possibilities. . . . 
The object takes the spectator in hand 
rather than being taken in hand by the 
spectator. It is the object itself that takes 
him in hand, because it makes him see it 
on the inside. By making him see it on the 
inside, it creates a model of open culture, 
which is superior to the fact of the surface, 
of the impact on the surface, when you 
don't know the interior. This is the phe- 
nomenon that I want to keep looking for, 
and naturally, here, on a large scale, it will 
be a moment of tension. At a certain 
moment, the tension between small and 
large will emerge. The issue remains open.

I want to do a portrait immediately. 
Impossible. But it is possible to hide 
the portrait in the depths of a forest. 
Perhaps give it a small table and a 
stool. The table will be rickety. The 
stool will soon be moist because of 
water from the terribly huge plant 
that towers above it. With the slow 
descent of a spider towards the 
decompensated portrait, the painter's 
brain can start to move. It will be 
impossible to resolve the question of 
whether the immense plant and the 
water, which goes everywhere, will 
not leave a minimum space for the 
formation of some approximate but 
thriving sensation that is present to 
the sensorial machine of the painter 
sculptor architect abandoned with the 
presumption of doing a portrait in 
the middle of the forest. The violets 
and the grays will appear and also 
perhaps forms that are more animal 
than human. My instruments are an 
inactive and no longer usable capsule 
which is ugly but can easily be 
thought of as being abandoned in the 
bramble. Charcoal, charcoal, to 
follow the lines that in some way are 
the violet so that a heavenly timid 
being can become the surface of the 
portrait. The skin of the portrait is 
obviously becoming animallike, that 
is, a functioning mechanism and, 
covering itself with animallike fury, 
it abandons any semblance of human 
psychology. Thus, the earth again 
takes on that which it caused to give 
birth. And one can write something 
about doing, that is, forming 
abandoning a form in order to see 
the past being transformed and 
mocked.

Interview with Mario Merz 
Guggenheim Museum, New York, 
February 1989 



When you do your show at the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum in New York this 
year, you will be forced to engage in a 
dialogue with Frank Lloyd Wright's archi- 
tecture. You will therefore have to establish 
a relationship between the fluid situation of 
the artistic object and the rigid situation of 
the museum building. How do you intend 
to cope with that situation, and what 
problems do you foresee? 
First of all, I absolutely have to say that my 
birth was violated by architecture. That's 
almost a fact of ancestral psychoanalysis. 
There is always an ancestral component in 
a person's work and in what he does. I 
remember feeling a kind of love-hate when 
I saw grass amid rocks, and I thought: That 
is life. When I didn't see grass amid rocks, 
I felt a sense of sadness. I am not trying to 
make an ecological statement, I simply want 
to give you a glimpse into my mind. A lot 
of children don't notice the grass, they 
prefer biking - which also happened with 
me. But I had a sense of doubleness, of 
subdivision between architecture and what 
is ultimately called life. And I always 
wondered why human beings invented that 
whole thing known as architecture. 
It's an action of placing stone upon stone. 
Yes. Something Fve never really under- 
stood. Yet at the same time, it may be 
humanity's greatest invention, because the 
placing of stone upon stone actually created 
a sense of refuge. The human being created 
a world for himself, which estranges him 
from the organic. Even a car is architecture, 
so is a plane, and so was a boat - they're 
perfect architecture with the possibility of 
having everything, including movement. 
That was what my bicycle meant for me: 
using a device that becomes architecture. 
Vittorio Gregotti talks about the impor- 
tance of the design of the bicycle. It's true, 
it's important for an architect, and I felt the 
same way, in that I saw architecture as an 
element of violence against the organic. 
There are rather violent transitions between 
inside and outside, which I feel strongly, 
even in a fine architect. 
Then, I revolted and made up my mind in 
art: I would make the problem between 
inside and outside dialectical, by creating 
architecture within architecture: the hemi- 
sphere, which was then called "igloo" in the 
more ecological and also more superficial 
sense of the word. But it is real architecture, 



like a beehive — an intrinsically simple 
architecture. And that is the very reason 
why I want to make it complex, for 
instance, by using glass shards or similar 
things in the igloo - elements coming from 
outside. Thus, once again, the problem is 
art history, the painting. Whenever you 
enter a church and you see a painting, which 
is central, the icon, you wonder: what came 
first - the painting or the stone and the 
architecture? Those are two elements that 
mutually support each other. And in the 
case of this work, I feel that the details will 
be of great interest since this is a general 
systematization. Frank Lloyd Wright's 
Guggenheim in particular seems to be a 
totality, a thorough overall synthesis; yet 
the details are important in that they create 
an internal landscape. My problem will be 
to create an internal landscape. My internal 
landscape will be superimposed upon an 
internal landscape that already exists - that 
of the museum and that of Frank Lloyd 
Wright. 

Like a fresco added to the temple? 
Exactly like a fresco. And if I like the fresco, 
it becomes a mosaic, with its fabulous 
ability to be architecture. For instance the 
mosaic floor of the Romans was exceptional 
in that it represented things: it was architec- 
ture per se. So was the Byzantine mosaic. 
I am attempting to do something similar. 
Not putting the object in view, or rather not 
placing the object as an artwork, but instead 
positing it as an architectural project, the 
very essence of architecture. 
I am close to architecture, but I don't want 
to emphasize it. I want to create an inside 
architecture, the one done by Wright - 
maximal, radicalized. I don't want to place 
an emphasis on architecture, it's not neces- 
sary because it's already history. And since 
it's history, emphasizing it would be boring. 
It's better to radicalize the presence of art 
in such a way that it can become history. 
The igloo is an architectural structure that 
resorts to frail and ephemeral materials, such 
as glass shards and twigs, stucco and neon. 
It therefore opposes the absoluteness of 
Wright's architecture. We are in the actual 
contact of two epidermises: one is soft, 
nervous and cutting, the other secure, linear 
and affirmative. 

I have to accept my fresco, my psychopathic 
existence. I have to accept the fact that 
today's world creates psychopaths, not 



straight, linear people. Straightness is [in- 
trinsic to] the machine, but the human being 
inserted into the gears is really very twisted. 
We have an inner body and an outer body. 
Ultimately the inner body is more impor- 
tant than the outer one. 
In seeking analogies with the past, can one 
say that your intention is to weld (your 
Welder painting was done during the fifties) 
together two architectural structures, the 
igloo and the museum? 
I recall the sight of the young grass, the 
moss emerging almost against its will 
between two rocks. Even today I still 
remember how fascinating it was - I was 
almost scared of it. 

One night, while going through the de- 
serted city, I saw two men, and instead of 
seeing them like normal workers doing a 
normal hard job - welding - I saw them 
as new beings who were adding something 
- not sociologically, but in a much larger 
sense, like the human being who works 
with an object, the blowtorch, that does not 
belong to the day. An object that produces 
sparks: I am talking about the oxy-hydro- 
gen flame. 

I then felt that this oxy-hydrogen flame 
should enter my world. It was something 
that I felt I had to paint. Even though it 
created problems for me, because the oxy- 
hydrogen flame is one thing and painting 
is another. But I abandoned the idea of 
finding a solution to the issue of painting, 
and I put that nocturnal phantom directly 
into the picture: the man working on the 
trolley wheel with the blowtorch flame. 
This inspired me not to be afraid of taking 
qualitative leaps: jumping from a painterly 
order so as to embrace a presence that brings 
disorder. Painting is basically a treasure- 
trove of order, but sometimes it's over- 
whelmed with external elements that even- 
tually cause it to lose its order. And that was 
sort of the adventure I embarked on. 
From the psychological viewpoint of the 
work, your relationship to Europe and Italy 
is different from your relationship to Ameri- 
ca or fapan - I mean, with regard to 
language and focus. These two relationships 
are two different territories. Do you feel that 
your emotional or psychopathic reactions are 
constantly transferred, or do you have a 
different way of reacting?! am referring, say, 
to the twig landscapes of Zurich or the 
Chapelle Saint-Louis de la Salpetriere in

Paris - both of which are part of a European 
landscape. 

I believe it will be very difficult to place 
them within the context of the Guggen- 
heim. It will be impossible, because Ameri- 
ca rejects certain poetic attitudes, making 
us feel unfavored by fortune. It is the 
problem of surviving in a complex world. 
In some places there are favorable elements; 
in others there are none. 
The problem of architecture is that of 
external and internal. Even in America 
architecture confronts the geography of the 
country; it is not true that architecture is 
total. Even in New York, when I take a 
walk on my own, I see that it's like being 
on a boat, you go from east to west and from 
south to north. You feel the geography of 
the rock on which the works, the skyscrap- 
ers, are built. I don't feel as if I were in the 
belly of the Big Apple, I feel like I'm on 
a ship or in a spaceship, where life keeps 
going on. If I see it in those terms, I can 
then include Central Park in my work. But 
it will be different from what I did in 
Switzerland, where the carpet of twigs 
evoked the local countrvside. Central Park 
exists on this ship, which is New York, and 
I don't regard Central Park as a place where 
I can go to read my newspaper - I think 
of it as architecture. Its form is architecture, 
and I'm interested in the organisms that 
constitute the outside of that total architec- 
ture that is Manhattan. 
That's why you see Central Park as a 
different edifice, in the sense that it is not 
the Swiss landscape or the Italian landscape. 
Central Park is Central Park, and it can't 
be mistaken for the trees you see in 
Switzerland or Italy. The twigs have to 
become the Central Park of my work at the 
Guggenheim, they can't be a repetition of 
what I did in Europe - above all, because 
of the meaning that Central Park has for this 
total architecture that is New York. The 
idea of the indefinite park does not exist. 
Central Park is truly Central Park, it has 
an architectural definition. 
At the Salpetriere in Paris, you used the 
twigs to create a small park inside the glass 
igloo, so that the wooden confessionals and 
the church pews became architectural struc- 
tures surrounding the architecture of the 
igloo, which was isolated in its park of twigs. 
In Manhattan I see those skyscrapers, 
which are not isolated from one another, 



they are points. They form a complex of 
mutually dependent architectural struc- 
tures. My work is very similar to that 
situation. An organic element leans on an 
inorganic element, which becomes the oth- 
er's opposite in both color and meaning. 
This opposition is fundamental for me. I 
would say that I am repeating the analogy 
of the grass between the rocks. My twigs 
will be placed in a stone architecture, they 
will grow unwittingly, like the grass, in the 
cement cavity of the Guggenheim. The same 
thing is bound to happen with the electrici- 
tv, whose presence I make obvious in the 
flow of neon light. This too is an organic 
element, a natural energy that moves freely 
through space, crossing things and objects, 
the igloo and the tables. 
Hence, the neon lance that penetrates things 
is similar - so far as you are concerned - to 
the twigs or to the glass that enters the 
stucco? 

In a certain sense, yes. By putting every- 
thing together, I touch remote poles: a 
bundle of twigs, a piece of wood, a glass 
shard and the electrode. To cover that 
distance I have to make a tremendous effort. 
This is the foundation of my work. 
Because I had to react to both Minimalism 
and figurative art - not because I didn't 
want them, but because it was necessary for 
me to react, so that art could survive, not 
only for me, but also for others. 
A survival that I could bring about onlv by 
stretching my arms far apart and touching 
two widely separated poles with one finger 
each. That is the foundation of my work. 
Do the two poles produce a vitalizing 
discharge? 



Instead of a single line, they create an 
electric arc that produces a palpable tension. 
The person who doesn't feel it is used to 
the idea of an art with a precise value. In 
my art I did the opposite: I counterpoised 
two mutually remote values. 
I also did painted canvases in order to 
experiment with the possibility of going 
against objectality. At a certain point objec- 
tality became a canon - which made it 
dangerous. I therefore preferred placing the 
canvas inside the igloo. And even inside that 
snail, Wright's hollow, I saw a being that 
could happily flit about inside it. And inside 
that vacuum I hope to place a painted 
canvas that traverses an igloo, that is both 
inside and outside. A being that is inside

and outside an architectural structure, even 
inside and outside itself. This brings back 
my idea of psychopathy, or of the nervous 
being that sustains its nervousness inside 
and outside life. 

Can Wright's upside-down cone be thought 
of as an igloo seen from below? 
The ceiling is its base. It's a powerful 
feeling, the same thing I felt around certain 
big trees. It's something majestic, it's not 
dark, it responds to powers that are inside 
the human being - for instance enlarging 
the lungs in order to breathe better. Here 
the architecture creates the feeling of the sky 
above the earth. 

Do you feel analogies with your painted or 
interwoven cones? 

The cone derives from violence (the head 
of the lance), an intrinsic violence. But I 
don't play with violence, I play with 
equilibrium. There is the cone that transfix- 
es and there is the cone that rises: two 
elements that interpenetrate one another by 
playing diverse roles. 

The lance is an element that preceded the 
igloo. A major factor in my work. These are 
not real lances, they are rising cones. 
Elements of lightness. Wright's edifice has 
majesty as well as lightness. It's not only 
religious, it's also based on a Socratic idea, 
the idea of Socraticness. 
Your work has always included the notion 
of a theater of life, which has to be renewed 
constantly. Even the same structure becomes 
a different igloo. Take your idea of instabili- 
ty, your entrance with an unstable mosaic 
into the stability of architecture. How do 
you see this mechanism, which could be a 
weakness, but isn't, because it contains an 
enormous strength? How do you explain it? 
There are two possibilities: the matter can 
be resolved with an extremely rigorous 
aesthetics or with an extremely energetic 
aesthetics. Both solutions are radical, be- 
cause you don't know where maximum 
energy comes from, but you do know the 
source of maximum rigor. The problem is 
a historical one. Human beings are accus- 
tomed to rigor because they have drawn 
maps of the entire earth, they have traced 
lines from east and west and the whole 
segmentation of human life. Schedules are 
elements of rigor. Human beings are accus- 
tomed to both rigor and energy. They use 
energy as a living thing. Yet often energy 
is made to rest and it's tranquilized by the 



terms of rigor. Today rigor is reactionary. 
The public is more accustomed to represent- 
ing rigor than to representing energy. The 
latter is something that came with the 
Futurists, who sided with energy against 
rigor. The metaphysics of de Chirico repro- 
posed tranquility, silence, organization. I 
have to choose, and it is a dialectical choice, 
and even though I know both parts, I have 
to accept the improvisation or the energy 
element, the unknown that it involves. 
Naturally, perils exist. One has to go 
against oneself and not be argued into 
anything else. The public does not argue 
with me. The public, acting as a single 
entity, is reactionary. It actually sees art as 
a pause. Yet there are moments in the 
history of art, brief moments, when the 
public is virtually eliminated, and its 
thoughts are unimportant. 
If I were to think that the public were 
suddenly here, I would no longer feel free 
to pursue my experiments.

Works in the catalogue 



'Indicates work in the exhibition. 

Dimensions are not given for room-size 
and outdoor installations. As most of 
the works are irregular, dimensions are 
approximate. 

Dating: 

A hypnenated date, for example 1966- 
67, indicates that the object was 
worked on for the duration of time 
cited; the appearance of a plus mark, 
1966+67, indicates that the object was 
altered at the later date; the use of 
parentheses, 1966(85), indicates that 
the object was refabricated at the later 
date. 

Exhibition histories: 
It is often difficult to determine the 
precise exhibition histories of individu- 
al objects because of the ephemeral 
nature of Mario Merz's work and the 
scarcity of definitive records. Therefore 
we have assumed that works were 
included in an exhibition if they are 
illustrated in the catalogue for that 
exhibition and not otherwise docu- 
mented. 

Information under exhibitions and ref- 
erences is abbreviated. For full citations 
see the selected exhibitions lists and 
bibliography in this catalogue. Refer- 
ences with only a city, date, catalogue 
and/or page number signify the cata- 
logue produced for the exhibition in 
question; full data for these catalogues 
are given in the exhibitions lists rather 
than the bibliography.

Biography 





1925-40 

Mario Merz was born on January 1, 
1925, in Milan. His father was an 
engineer and inventor who designed 
engines for Fiat; his mother was a music 
teacher. He has one sister. During his 
early childhood, the family moved to 
Turin, where he attended the scientific 
lycee. Later he enrolled at the medical 
school of the Universita degli Studi di 
Torino and remained there for two 
vears. Before World War II Merz 
briefly experimented with concrete po- 
etry, an activity that prefigured both his 
evocative written statements that paral- 
lel his visual art and the neon script 
found in many of his later works. 
1941-45 

In 1944 Merz made drawings in which 
he did not lift his pencil from the paper 
until the drawing was complete. He did 
these while sitting in a field and referred 
to the technique as drawing in progres- 
sion or proliferation. During the war 
Merz joined the anti-Fascist group Giu- 
stizia e Liberta (Justice and Liberty). 
His participation in this organization 
involved distributing leaflets at the 
University. In 1945 he was arrested for 
such political activities and sent to the 
Carceri Nuove, a prison in Turin. 
While in jail he began to draw inces- 
santly on whatever materials he could 
find, such as letters, bread or cheese 
wrappers and the like. Once his father 
started to pressure him to select a 
profession after his release from prison, 
Merz fled to Paris where he worked as 
a truck driver in Les Halles while 
pursuing political activities. He visited 
the city's art museums, the Louvre in 
particular, but focused on contempo- 
rary painters such as Jean Dubuffet, 
Jean Fautrier and Jackson Pollock. He 
also read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre. 
1946-49 

Upon his return to Italy Merz began to 
read the writings of Franz Kafka, 
Cesare Pavese (Paesi tuoi), Karl Marx, 
John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men), 
Eugenio Montale (Ossi di seppia) and 
Leonardo da Vinci, particularly his 
writings on drawing. In Rapallo he saw 
Ezra Pound, whose work became an 
'important inspirational source for 
Merz's art. He befriended the Italian 
painters Mattia Moreni, Ennio Morlot- 
ti and Luigi Spazzapan. With the 
guidance of Brother Pontino, a profes- 
sor of art history and Italian, he became 
well acquainted with the work of Pablo 
Picasso, Georges Braque, Giorgio Mo- 
randi and Francesco Casorati. He trav- 
eled from Turin to Rome on a bicycle. 
In 1949 he returned to his method of 
drawing in progression, again working 
outdoors. 
1949 

Luciano Pistoi, an art historian and 
critic whom Merz met while in jail, 



published a drawing by the artist in the 
Communist newspaper L 'Unitd. The 
drawing illustrates Merz's face, ren- 
dered in a stylized manner with geomet- 
rical configurations. He considers this 
drawing a transitional work, for it 
market! a break from his previous, more 
realistic style. Its appearance in news- 
print was prescient in that Merz would 
later use stacked and crumbled news- 
papers as socially and politically 
charged components of his work. 
1950-59 

Merz began painting with oil on canvas, 
creating powerful but relatively dispas- 
sionate images in an attempt to distance 
himself from the Italian and French 
Informel movement of the early to 
mid-1950s. Employing a vocabulary of 
abstract imagery loosely derived from 
nature, Informel was dominated by the 
individuality of the artist's direct inter- 
action with the canvas. To counter this 
sensibility, Merz utilized industrial ma- 
terials such as enamel and spray paint, 
which he applied in his early canvases 
with a compressor. Even though he 
based these images on organic forms 
- as did the Informel artists - Merz 
considers them synedochic codes for the 
entire ecological system. These pain- 
tings were exhibited in Merz's first 
one-man show, organized by the art 
historian and critic, Luigi Carluccio, 
and held in 1954 at Galleria La Busso- 
la, Turin. Around this time Merz be- 
came acquainted with the artists Emilio 
Vedova and Pinot Gallizio. At the end 
of the decade he met his future wife, 
Marisa, who is also an artist. They 
traveled to Switzerland, where he con- 
tinued to paint and draw from nature. 
In Switzerland he decided to use tree 
branches in his work. 
1960-65 

Upon returning to Italy, the couple 
lived near Pisa in an old farmhouse, 
where Merz began experimenting in his 
painting with increased scale and using 
excessive amounts of pigment. In 1963 
Merz bought all the tubes of oil paint 
in the city of Pisa and applied their 
contents to a single canvas. Believing 
that painting has a life of its own, that 
it is a dynamic, unending process, Merz 
returned to his early canvases, covering 
their surfaces with numerous layers of 
paint. One painting from this period, 
worked on for an entire year, was 
purportedly five and seven-eighths 
inches thick. At that time, the spiral 
emerged as a motif in his work. Merz's 
second one-man exhibition, which fea- 
tured paintings, was held at the Galleria 
Notizie: Associazione Arti Figurative, 
Turin, in the spring of 1962. During 
these years, Turin was steadily evolving 
as an international art center. In 1964 
Merz began to experiment with shaped 
canvases and sculpture. 



1966-68 

By 1966 Merz had shifted away from 
painting and started making irregularly 
shaped blank canvases penetrated by 
thin neon tubes. The interpenetration 
of such disparate elements - material 
and light - created, for Merz, a discrete, 
unified object with provocative spatial 
and poetic possibilities. Beginning in 
1967 he pierced bottles, umbrellas, 
worn raincoats, and other items with 
ribbons of neon, visible currents of 
energy that symbolically transform, but 
do not destroy, the objects. These 
assemblages, including Horse Theater 
(Teatro cavallo) and Carrier Cone (Cono 
portante), were exhibited at Galleria 
Gian Enzo Sperone, Turin, in 1968. 
Before this solo show opened, Merz 
had embarked on an association with 
several artists based in Turin - Giulio 
Paolini, Gilberto Zorio, Jannis Kounel- 
lis, Luciano Fabro, Giuseppe Penone, 
Alighiero Boetti, Michelangelo Pisto- 
letto and Giovanni Anselmo - that has 
endured to the present. Through regu- 
lar discussions among themselves as 
well as with critics, writers, philoso- 
phers and political activists, they collec- 
tively formulated an antielitist aesthet- 
ic. In defiance of the dehumanizing 
aspects of industrialization and con- 
sumer capitalism then emerging in 
northern Italy, they embraced an art of 
humble materials drawn from everyday 
life and the organic world. 
Named Arte Povera by Germano Ce- 
lant on the occasion of a group exhibi- 
tion in 1967 at Galleria Bertesca in 
Genoa, this loosely defined and eclectic 
movement sought a radical but regener- 
ative art. 
1968 

Merz adopted his signature motif, the 
igloo, this year. In an effort to produce 
a surface independent from the wall, 
but not traditionally sculptural, Merz 
created a hemisphere that rests on the 
floor as an absolute space in itself. The 
igloo is a metaphorical form embodying 
Merz's belief that art is transitory and 
ever-changing, yet inexorably bound to 
the earth, specifically its local environ- 
ment. Merz associates the artist with 
the nomad, constantly in motion, at 
home evervwhere, in touch with both 
nature and culture. Constructed with 
segmented, metal armatures, the hemi- 
spherical structures are covered with a 
net and followed by fragments of clay, 
wax, mud or glass, or bundles of twigs. 
Political or literarv references in neon 
script often span the domes. The earli- 
est example, Giap Igloo (Igloo di Giap) 
bears a slogan in neon letters attributed 
to the North Vietnamese military strate- 
gist, General Vo Nguyen Giap: Se il 
nemico si concentra perde terreno se si 
disperde perde forza ("If the enemy 
masses his forces, he loses ground; if 



282 




he scatters, he loses strength.") The 
contradiction expressed in this phrase 
captures Merz's conception of the igloo 
- momentary shelter shifted from place 
to place so that, despite its temporality, 
it remains a constant. To symbolize the 
nomadic essence of the igloo, as well 
as its references to a simple, human- 
scale economic system close to nature, 
Merz uses materials indigenous to the 
sites of his exhibitions. For a show in 
Australia in 1979, for instance, he used 
eucalyptus leaves to blanket an igloo. 
And in his installation at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 
1989, he used granite from San Fernan- 
do Valley quarries and local palm 
fronds. 

Three other works from this period, 
comprised of melted wax in metal 
containers with neon words, have ex- 
plicit political references related to the 
uprisings of May 1968: What Is To Be 
Done? (Che fare?) and Solitary Solidari- 
ty (Solitario solidale). Merz saw the 
phrase "Solitaire solidaire" scrawled as 
graffiti on a wall in Paris. Che fare? is 
a translation of the title of Chto delat?, 
a 1912 speech by Lenin (later published 
in pamphlet form), which analyzes class 
political consciousness and the prole- 
tariat in Russia. The phrase had also 
been adopted for the title of an avant- 
garde critical journal published in May 
and November 1967 in Milan. During 
these years Merz was included in im- 
portant international exhibitions fea- 
turing Conceptual, process and Mini- 
malist art, such as Prospect 68 in 
Diisseldorf, Arte povera + azioni povera 
in Amalfi, Op Losse Schroeven: Situa- 
ties en cryptostructure in Amsterdam 
and Live in Your Head: When Attitudes 
Become Form in Bern. 
1970 

Since 1970, Merz has incorporated the 
Fibonacci formula of mathematical pro- 
gression into his works. Originally 
conceived by the medieval monk Leo- 
nardo da Pisa (known as Fibonacci) and 
explicated in his Liber Ahacci of 1202 
and 1228, the formula requires that 
each numeral cited equal the sum of the 
two numbers that precede it: 1, 1, 2, 
3, 5, 8, 13.... His observations were 
based on the reproduction of rabbits 
beginning with one pair and expanding, 
ultimately, to infinity. Corresponding 
to biological, spatial and temporal di- 
mensions, Fibonacci proportions relate 
to the proliferation and growth of 
organic materials - leaves, reptile skins, 
deer antlers, pinecones, seasnells, igua- 
na tails - items or images that Merz 
incorporates into his art. An early 
work, Propped (Appoggiati), of 1970, 
consisted of panes of glass leaned 
against a wall; to these panes were 
attached neon numbers in Fibonacci 
progression. The piece was shown at 



Gennaio 70, III Biennale internaziona- 
le della giovanc pittura along with 
Merz's videotape of a violinist playing 
chords corresponding to the Fibonacci 
sequence. For 10 Tokyo Biennale '70: 
Between Man and Matter in 1970, Merz 
created Proliferation of a Plant (Prolife- 
razione di una pianta), in which he 
analyzed and projected the proliferation 
of pine branches on the wall of the 
gallery with a sequence of neon num- 
bers connected bv cords. 
1971-72 

In 1971 Merz made his second videota- 
pe, Lumaca (produced by Gerry 
Schum), which is based on the Fibonac- 
ci proportions found in the spiral of 
snails' shells. For the Guggenheim 
International Exhibition 1971, Merz 
laced the interior of the Museum's 
ascending spiral with neon Fibonacci 
numerals in accordance with the struc- 
tural progression of the Frank Lloyd 
Wright design. In 1972 Merz had his 
first one-man exhibition in the United 
States at the Walker Art Center, Minne- 
apolis. At this time he introduced 
stacked newspapers, archetypal ani- 
mals, motorcycles, and photographs 
with neon into his increasingly complex 
iconography. This year also marked the 
emergence of the table as a central 
motif. Similar in meaning to Merz's 
igloo, the table has evolved historically 
from specific social requirements to 
become a locus of human activity. The 
photographic series A Real Sum Is a 
Sum of People of 1972, exhibited that 
year at the Jack Wendler Gallery, 
London, documents the seating ar- 
rangements of people in The George 
IV, a pub in Kentish Town, London, 
following the Fibonacci progression 
from one to fiftv-five. 
1973-77 

For his one-man exhibition at the John 
Weber Gallery in New York in 1973, 
Merz constructed wooden tables titled 
// is possible to have a space for 88 
people as it is possible to have a space 
with tables for no one. In 1974 Merz 
created long triangular tables, similar 
in shape to his earlier lances, which 
stood alone or intersected igloos. Later, 
glass tables were conceived in a spiral 
format, circling around themselves and 
the fruits, vegetables and branches they 
supported. Merz won a DAAD (Deut- 
scner Akademischer Austauschdienst) 
grant in Berlin in 1974. He had his first 
one-man museum exhibition in Europe 
at the Kunsthalle Basel in 1975, fol- 
lowed by a show in the same year at 
the Institute of Contemporary Art, 
London. 
1977-89 

By 1977, Merz had enthusiastically 
returned to painting, the activity with 
which he began his career. He contin- 
ued to employ three-dimensional motifs 



and the Fibonacci sequence and concur- 
rently developed a rich iconographic 
painting style. Primarily figurative yet 
intensely abstracted, the paintings de- 
pict mythological beasts - lizards, croc- 
odiles, lions, rhinoceroses, bison - with 
convoluted and exaggerated anatomies. 
These vigorously gestural, brightly col- 
ored images are often combined with 
accumulations of branches, traversed 
by neon or draped over igloos. The 
theme of the Painter in Africa (Pittore 
in Africa), of an artist who travels to 
a fantastic place to paint fabulous 
animals, emerged in 1981. Merz also 
began constructing double igloos and 
then triple igloos, one inside the other, 
utilizing the property of transparency 
in order to display the layered struc- 
tures. Subsequent installations were 
increasingly multifarious, combining 
tables, igloos, paintings, fruits and 
vegetables, newspapers, stuffed croco- 
diles and neon. In 1981 Merz won the 
Arnold Bode prize of the city of Kassel, 
West Germany, and in 1983 he was 
awarded the Oskar Kokoschka prize by 
the city of Vienna. 

Recent exhibitions have offered Merz 
the opportunity to respond directly to 
the architectural environment in which 
his works are seen, much in the spirit 
of his 1971 Guggenheim installation. 
In 1984 he placed neon numbers, in 
ascending Fibonacci sequence, on the 
spire of the Mole Antonelliana in 
Turin. In 1987 Merz was invited to 
create an installation at the Salpetriere 
in Paris, a seventeenth-century com- 
pound which once housed Jean Martin 
Charcot's neurological clinic, where 
early studies of hysteria were conduct- 
ed. The Chapelle Saint-Louis, also on 
this site, is still used today. Merz's 
installation in the chapel, which includ- 
ed a monumental glass igloo and a 
linear proliferation of Fibonacci num- 
bers running along the floor under 
metal arches, acquired new metaphoric 
dimensions in such an environment. 
The infinitude suggested by the Fibo- 
nacci series and the transparency of the 
igloo corresponded to the metaphysical 
trappings of the church architecture. 
Concurrently and subversively, the 
heightened subjectivity - the Nietz- 
schian air of Merz's program - evoked 
the hidden memory of Charcot's asy- 
lum. Using a few central motifs, but 
recreating and transforming them in 
response to each environment in which 
he exhibits, Merz produces a theater of 
meaning particular to each of his instal- 
lation sites.
