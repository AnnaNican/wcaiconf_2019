Director's Statement 



American Pop Icons is the third exhibition 
to be presented in Las Vegas at the 
Guggenheim Hermitage Museum as part of 
an ongoing collaboration between two of the 
world's leading cultural institutions. Drawing 
from and expanding on the rich holdings of 
diverse collections with the aim of making 
them accessible to a wider audience, the 
Guggenheim Hermitage Museum continues 
to organize significant exhibitions, promoting 
scholarly research that extends the scope of 
public awareness through its presentations 
and publications. 

Inaugurated in 2001, the "jewel-box" 
exhibition space within the Venetian Resort- 
Hotel-Casino was designed by internationally 
recognized architect Rem Koolhaas and 
has proven to be a unique and versatile 
contemporary space in which to showcase 
artworks from very different time periods. 
Following two exhibitions of European 
masterpieces ranging from the Renaissance 
and Baroque periods to the early twentieth 
century from the collections of the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum. New York, the 
Hermitage State Museum, St. Petersburg, 
and the Kunsthistorisches, Vienna, the 
Guggenheim Hermitage Museum now 
presents an exhibition of paintings and 
sculpture by American Pop artists, 
expanding on the strong collection of the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. 

American Pop Icons includes seminal works 
by some of the twentieth century's most 
celebrated artists. From Robert Rauschenberg's 
Combine paintings to Jasper Johns's Flags, 



and from Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup 
Cans to Roy Lichtenstein's oversized comic- 
strip inspired canvases, the works shown 
here represent a key moment in American art 
history in which artists turned away from the 
painterly concerns of Abstract Expressionism 
toward an engagement with the culture that 
surrounded them Internationally the focus 
of the art world at this time was very much 
on America. In many ways, the artists' works 
reflect this, revealing the nature of art- 
making in an all-encompassing consumer 
culture of the time.

Preface and 
Acknowledgments 



Numerous individuals and institutions have 
ottered their assistance to the creation ot 
this exhibition. On behalt ot the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Foundation and the 
Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, I would 
like to extend our deepest gratitude to the 
lenders. Their participation is critical to the 
success ot any exhibition and made even 
more difficult when the artworks involved 
are so iconic to the history of twentieth- 
century art. Ileana Sonnabend and Antonio 
Homem of the Sonnabend Collection 
enthusiastically embraced the concept for 
this exhibition from its inception and their 
loans serve as a cornerstone of this 
exhibition. Artists Jasper Johns and James 
Rosenquist have each supported the 
exhibition with loans of their artwork from 
their private collections; their individual 
engagement is a credit to their ongoing 
interest in the history of Pop art. Jose 
Berardo, Bernard Jacobson, Torsten Lilja, 
and several anonymous lenders have each 
allowed key artworks from their collection 
to join the fabric of the exhibition. 

For assistance in obtaining loans, I have 
relied on the considerable knowledge and 
good will of a select group of colleagues in 
the trade: Paul Gray of the Richard Gray 
Gallery, Chicago and New York; James Mayor 
of the Mayor Gallery, London; Bob Monk; 
Edward Nahem of Edward Nahem Fine Art, 
New York; and Jennifer Vorbach of C &amp; M 
Arts, New York. Each has offered their trust 
and cooperation for which I am most 
grateful. Additional assistance in securing 
important loans has been capably provided 
by Isabel Soares Alves, Laura Bloom, Ann 
Carley, Beverly Coe, Michael Harrigan, 
Robert Hollister, Lynn Kearcher, Josey Kraft, 
Esty Neuman, Xan Price, Sarah Taggart, 
and Christine Zehner. 



Sylvia Sleigh, Lawrence Alloway's widow and 
herself a renowned portrait painter, and 
her archivist, Hephsie Loeb, graciously 
opened the Lawrence Alloway archive for my 
review. Access to important archival 
documentation from the Six Painters and 
the Object exhibition has been provided by 
Lynn Underwood, Director of Information 
Integration and Management at the 
Guggenheim. At the Menil Collection, 
Houston, my former colleagues, Geraldine 
Aramanda, Aichivist; Phil Heagy, Librarian; 
and Mary Kadish, Assistant Registrar, fielded 
numerous research queries. Walter Hopps 
first informed my understanding of Pop art, 
while Don Quaintance, Julia Blaut, and 
Simonetta Fraquelli each in their own way 
continue to extend my research. Woodfin 
Camp, who represents photographer Ken 
Heyman, readily made available photographs 
of the period while Kim Bush, Photography 
and Permissions Manager at the 
Guggenheim, provided images of the 
artworks in the Guggenheim's collection. 

My curatorial colleagues at the Guggenheim — 
Sarah Bancroft, Tracey Bashkoff, Jennifer 
Blessing, Nancy Spector, Kara Vander Weg, 
and Joan Young — have contributed insightful 
entries on the artworks in the exhibition. I 
am most appreciative of their dedication and 
camaraderie in producing this material in 
such a timely manner. Charles Stainback, 
Director of the Frances Young Tang Teaching 
Museum and Art Gallery generously agreed 
to allow texts written by Rachal Haidu for his 
recent touring exhibition From Pop to Now: 
Selections from the Sonnabend Collection 
to be reprinted here. 

The spirited engagement of the entire staff 
at the Guggenheim Museum has assured 
the successful realization of this exhibition.

and the Object (1963) 



THE DECADE OF THE 1960s was one of the 
most provocative — culturally, politically, and 
philosophically — of the twentieth century. 
America had become an industrialized society 
poised on the brink of the information age. 
The remarkable economic growth that transpired 
from the end of the Second World War through 
the Cold War period of the 1950s resulted in a 
newly invigorated consumer culture in America. 

A number of the artists who emerged, or more 
appropriately, burst upon the art world, 
particularly in New York and Los Angeles in the 
first years of the decade, were responding to 
this new commercialism. Indeed those who 
came to be identified as Pop artists embraced 
consumerism as a fitting subject of their art. 
Expression and gesture — hallmarks of Abstract 
Expressionism which preceded Pop in the late 
1940s and early 1950s— were replaced with 
cool, detached, mechanical illustrations of 
common objects, often based on appropriated 
advertising images. Pop art was in fact 
proposing a new kind of subjectivity, one that 
did not rely on an artist's singular expressive 
gesture, the main d' artiste. While many of the 
Abstract Expressionists had turned hermetically 
inward, the Pop artists turned outward for 
aesthetic stimuli. Radically redefining the subject 
matter deemed suitable for aesthetic use, Pop art 
was a significant sociological phenomenon and 
a mirror of society. In turn, the consumer 
industry itself adopted Pop art as an antidote to 
the rigidity of "high art." 

In Pop art, the narrative or epic impulse of 
Abstract Expressionism was replaced with 
straightforward depictions of the everyday, 
and the mass-produced was afforded the same 
significance as unique works of fine art; the 
gulf between "high art" and "low art" was 
gleefully eroded. Basing their techniques, style, 
and imagery on certain aspects of mass 
reproduction, media-derived imagery, and 



consumer society, artists such as Jim Dine, 
Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James 
Rosenquist, Andy Warhol, and Tom Wesselmann 
took inspiration from advertising, pulp 
magazines, billboards, movies, television, comic 
strips, and shop windows. Their images, 
presented with— and sometimes transformed 
by — humor, wit, and irony, may be read as both 
an unabashed celebration and a scathing critique 
of popular culture. 

American Pop icons features thirty-two paintings 
and sculptures from eight of the most important 
precursors to and participants in the Pop art 
movement — Dine, Jasper Johns, Lichtenstein, 
Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Rosenquist, 
Warhol, and Wesselmann. This concise overview 
takes as its starting point the Guggenheim's 
leading role among museums in bringing Pop art 
to a wider audience when it presented— at the 
height of the movement — the seminal exhibition 
Six Painters and the Object (March 14-June 12, 
1963), organized by British art historian, curator, 
and critic Lawrence Alloway, and its 
accompanying catalogue (figs. 1 and 2). The 
Guggenheim would continue this tradition with 
monographic exhibitions for Lichtenstein, Dine, 
Oldenburg, Rauschenberg, Rosenquist, and 
Warhol in subsequent years. 1 Few of the 
artworks included in Alloway's exhibition are 
shown here, but the same spirit is unmistakably 
present. American Pop Icons showcases Pop art 
acquisitions made by the Guggenheim since 
Six Painters and the Object. 2 In addition, 
important loans are drawn from the collection 
of lleana Sonnabend, who was one of the most 
significant Pop art collectors and gallerists, as 
well as from institutional and private lenders in 
the United States and Europe. 

This exhibition references Alloway's timely 
Pop art show, organized at the very moment 
when the movement was so fresh that 
misconceptions and derision far outweighed

acceptance. This current presentation has been 
expanded to include eight artists, rather than 
Alloway's original choice ot six, and treats 
Rauschenberg and Johns as precursors to the 
movement rather than central practitioners. 
Moreover, the addition of Oldenburg and 
Wesselmann here is an effort to close the gap on 
their omission from Six Painters and the Object* 

The term "Pop art" was first used in print by 
Alloway in 1958 to characterize the 
manifestations of popular culture (television, 
advertising, billboards, magazines) that were 
considered inferior to high culture. 5 Alloway. who 
was a member of the Independent Group 6 — an 
interdisciplinary group of British artists, 
architects, and critics— called for an art that 
would reflect contemporary experience and 
popular culture, would have a common interest 
in vernacular sources, and would share an 
aim to attack absolutist theories of art. The 
Independent Group organized four exhibitions, 
including the groundbreaking This Is Tomorrow 
(Whitechapel Art Gallery, London. 1956) where 
another one of its members, Richard Hamilton, 
presented his now-famous collage (originally 
made for the exhibition's poster and as a 
catalogue illustration) Just what is it that makes 
today's homes so different, so appealing? 
(1956), a seminal work that anticipated most 
aspects of Pop art. Signaling the dominance of 
American culture even in postwar-depressed 
London, Hamilton's sources were culled from 
American popular publications, such as Life 
magazine, brought to England by fellow artist 
John McHale. This seemingly nonsensical 
collage depicts a domestic interior engulfed in 
contemporary information transmission systems, 
including a movie marquee, telephones, tape 
recorders, televisions, etc. A standing 
muscleman holds a Tootsie Pop as if it were 
a tennis racket, while a scantily clad woman 
lounges on the sofa, ignoring her domestic 
duties. The nearly nude muscleman and his 



voluptuous companion telegraph the erotic 
charge that modern advertising has attributed to 
acts of consumerism 

While its terminology and initial critical thinking 
originated in England. Pop art simultaneously 
arose in America where it would reach its fullest 
incarnation. Around the same time that the 
Independent Group was active. Rauschenberg 
proposed an alternative to the prevailing mode 
of art making in the United States The diverse 
objects of Rauschenberg's celebrated Combine 
paintings fused two-dimensional painting with 
sculpture. Johns, playing on illusion and reality, 
repainted beer cans, targets, and the American 
flag, objects so iconic and commonplace that 
they required a new set of criteria to be viewed 
as artworks. The unique approach of 
Rauschenberg and Johns to the object paved the 
way for artists in the next decade. Oldenburg's 
configurations of functional objects like 
telephones and his enlarged soft sculptures of 
food. Roy Lichtenstem's borrowings from comic 
strips. James Rosenquist's billboard montages 
of banal media-derived images, and Andy 
Warhol's repetitions of images of celebrities and 
contemporary brand-name products all pushed 
subject matter to such prominence that it 
temporarily masked out formal considerations 
As the art historian Leo Steinberg commented: 
"Our eyes will have to grow accustomed to 
a new presence in art: the presence of subject 
matter absolutely at one with the form " Many 
of these artists used commercial and mechanical 
processes such as photography or silkscreening. 
thus obtaining a flat rendering that denied any 
subjective emotion Their work was snappy but 
detached— the epitome of cool 

In 1962. Thomas Messer. the Guggenheim's 
director, enticed Alloway to leave England 
permanently to become his principal curatorial 
appointment at the museum It was Alloway's 
first curatorial job in America* and seemingly

a bold move on Messer's part to charge an 
Englishman with the task of "acquainting the 
museum's public with aspects of current 
American art." 9 Like his predecessor at the 
Guggenheim, James Johnson Sweeney, whose 
curatorial objectives encompassed a broader 
sensibility of Modern art, Alloway veered away 
from the founding director Hilla von Rebay's 
lifelong passion for the spiritual in art and her 
reliance on nonobjective painting and sculpture. 
Alloway's "liberal and broadly inclusive aesthetic 
orientation could not have been more dissimilar 
from Rebay's quest for the metaphysical essence 
of painting." 10 Yet the two were remarkably 
similar in their fundamental understanding of 
the art contemporary to their own time. Then 
as now, the Guggenheim's approach to the 
presentation of art encompasses a two-part 
objective, one aspect of which commemorates 
elements of the recent art-historical past; the 
other focuses on the immediate present with an 
eye toward future developments." It was in this 
vein that Alloway, upon accepting his post, 



immediately began work on the exhibition 
Six Painters and the Object. That Alloway 
would want to organize a Pop exhibition for the 
Guggenheim was not so improbable. He had 
been charged with raising the profile of the 
institution and what better way to do so than 
to show radical new art that had everyone 
talking — a movement with which he was already 
intimately engaged. Being a recent immigrant to 
America was no disadvantage for him. 12 In fact, 
he readily accepted American Pop art as a more 
successful phenomenon than its counterparts 
in England or France. 

Intended to be the first museum exhibition 
devoted solely to this burgeoning trend in 
American art, Six Painters and the Object, was 
by the time it opened on March 14, 1963, in fact 
the second." However, its importance cannot 
be underestimated. Of all the Pop art exhibitions 
that were organized in the 1960s, Alloway's 
was the only one that stressed the historical 
tradition of the movement. By underscoring the 
past, Alloway established a framework for Pop.

He established as influences the eighteenth- 
century prints of William Hogarth, the 
nineteenth-century engravings of Gustave 
Courbet, Post-Impressionist paintings by Vincent 
van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, and the earlier 
twentieth-century machine paintings of Fernand 
Leger. Moreover, Six Painters and the Object 
was the only Pop art exhibition of significance 
presented by a New York museum in the 1960s, 
a fact that went a long way toward legitimizing 
the activities of these artists. The exhibition 
generated an unusual amount of national press 
coverage, not only in art magazines but also in 
monthly news journals and on television.' 4 

Prior to Alloway's Guggenheim exhibition, the 
art world was struggling to properly identify the 
new aesthetic it found itself confronted with. 
The speed with which Pop art excited the 
popular imagination was a corollary to the 
very brief period of time in which it initially 
flourished, from 1960 to 1964. Contrary to the 
adage that most great art is ignored for years, 
this new art quickly burst onto the scene, 
sparking so much interest and enthusiasm from 



critics, collectors, and gallery owners that even 
its moniker was much debated: New Realism. 
Popular Image Art, Common Object Art 
Factualism, Neo Dadaism. American Dream 
Painting, Sign Painting. Anti-Sensibility Painting, 
and Cool-Art were |ust a few names put forth in 
an attempt to label the new art Pop art won 
out. being a short hand for popular culture that 
then evolved to describe the artistic expressions 
of that culture 

It was actually a group of commercial art 
galleries that were the first to champion Pop art 
by presenting seemingly nonstop single-artist 
shows, creating a buzz that in many cases 
generated immediate sales. Collectors— from 
taxi company owner Robert Scull (fig 3) to 
insurance executive Leon Kraushar (fig 4) 
to Burton and Emily Tremame to Count Guiseppe 
Panza di Biumo — competed in a frenzied rush to 
acquire the best and latest of the new American 
art. ' Kraushar. perhaps the gutsiest of the group 
and arguably the one who possessed the best 
eye proselytized in Life magazine: "Pop is the 
art of today, and tomorrow, and all the future.

Both 1960 and 1961 were still emergent years 
for the mainstream's awareness ot Pop art, 20 
but by 1962, the movement was well established 
in the art world. Museums across the country 
were picking up on the new art and including 
representative artists in thematic group 
exhibitions. The first to include nearly all the Pop 
artists was Douglas MacAgy's 1961 exhibition 
for the Dallas Museum of Contemporary Arts 
(April 3-May 13, 1962), which included works 
by Dine (A Universal Color Chart), Lichtenstein 
(The Kiss), Johns {Portrait— Viola Farber), 
Rauschenberg (Stripper), and Rosenquist 
(Shadows), as well as a selection of soft 
sculptures from Oldenburg's The Store. Taking 
the year of creation as the basis for inclusion 
of each work, 1961 was a mixed bag of thirty-six 
artists that ranged from Joseph Albers to Robert 
Motherwell to Jack Youngerman, with a host of 
regional Texas artists, such as Joseph Glasco 
and Roy Fridge, thrown in for good measure. 
Despite the melange, the exhibition successfully 
tracked the diversity of artistic expression at 
the moment. Not limiting himself to the visual 
arts, MacAgy commissioned a performance 
piece from Oldenburg, whose Injun was the first 
Happening to take place in a museum. 21 




Such avant-garde activity may seem at odds with 
the perception of Dallas as a cultural backwater, 
but MacAgy was a sophisticated transplant who 
had had an illustrious national career as both an 
art educator and museum director— he was 
someone with his finger on the pulse. 22 

Later that year, another prognosticator, Walter 
Hopps, curator of the Pasadena Museum of Art 
(now the Norton Simon Museum), assembled 
the first fully realized Pop art exhibition in the 
United States. (Alloway's Guggenheim exhibition 
would, nonetheless, have a greater impact on the 
national scene.) Hopps's exhibition was entitled 
New Painting of Common Objects (September 
25-October 19, 1962) and included eight artists 
whose work he believed represented a common 
thread of the current avant-garde. 23 He featured 
the West Coast Pop painters Robert Dowd, Joe 
Goode, Phillip Hefferton, Ed Ruscha, and Wayne 
Thiebaud, whose work was less detached than 
the three Pop artists from New York — Dine, 
Lichtenstein, and Warhol — he included. Hopps's 
familiarity with the new art grew out of his years 
as cofounder, with assemblage artist Edward 
Keinholz, of the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. 
Like Alloway, Hopps had recently joined the staff 
of a museum and, also like Alloway, brought to 
the curatorial position a unique knowledge of 
contemporary art and an uncanny ability to 
refine this knowledge that continues to this day. 2 ' 
While important in the critical acceptance of the 
history of Pop art and despite the fact that it 
was the first, the Pasadena exhibition garnered 
little national attention save two idiosyncratic 
reviews that struggled with the mundane and 
banal concepts of consumerism that the 
exhibition presented. 25 

The latter months of 1962 brought many of the 
issues surrounding the legitimacy of Pop art to 
the fore. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 
founded as the defender of Modern art, held a 
symposium that debated the merits of the style. 26 



16 



Newspapers and periodicals devoted countless 
pages to the new American art. although most 
art critics were initially bemused or hostile. 
With the exception of Alloway and Gene 
Swenson, " most believed that Pop art lacked 
metaphor and symbol, the very qualities that 
defined high art. In addition, commentators 
were appalled by the paintings' untransformed 
presentation of commercial subject matter, an 
aspect much debated at the Museum of Modern 
Art's symposium. The fact that the subject of this 
new art depicted familiar things, things they all 
knew, unsettled the art critics because it did not 
follow Modernism's prescriptions for aesthetic 
usage. Instead, Pop art glorified consumerism, 
a category traditionally considered lowbrow. 

International Exhibition of the New Realists 
(November 1-December 1, 1962). the most 
critical gallery exhibition and the largest devoted 
exclusively to the emergent new art, was 
organized by the esteemed Sidney Janis Gallery 
in New York. ?9 Well known for championing the 
work of Abstract Expressionist artists like 
Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark 
Rothko — the very artists whose success the Pop 
group threatened— Janis's foray into the new art 
was something of a departure for the gallery. 
The exhibition presented Janis's interpretation of 
the worldwide activities of artists working under 
the Pop rubric, at that moment still unnamed 
One to three works each by fifty-four English, 
French, German, Italian, and American artists 
who were addressing the object as subject were 
assembled both in the gallery's two main rooms 
at 15 East Fifty-seventh Street, and in an empty 
storefront across Fifth Avenue from the gallery 
at 19 West Fifty-seventh Street, fully visible to 
midtown's busy city dwellers (fig. 5). Mimicking 
Oldenburg's The Store on the Lower Eastside. 
where the initiated and the uninitiated could 
wonder in off the street to purchase his then 
inexpensive sculptures of clothing (sneakers, 
pants, or shirts, ties, hats, etc.) or food 



(doughnuts, candy bars, sandwiches, cakes, 
etc.), Janis's show "hit the New York art world 
with the force of an earthquake " 

Months before the Jams exhibition opened. 
Alloway formally proposed his Pop art exhibition 
to the Guggenheim's board of trustees He 
envisioned an extravaganza that would fill "two 
ramps [of the museum's spiral] showing about 
forty-five artworks by a maximum of twenty 
artists from East and West coasts of US" and 
would "be sufficient to (a) demonstrate common 
features and (b) the diversity within the style." 
Although Alloway had coined the term "Pop art" 
years earlier, he acknowledged that at this 
particular time (August 19621 the new art was 
still grappling with its identity, referring to his 
proposed exhibition as a "group show sampling 
a current trend: artists with no agreed-on name " 
Being the father of the term he considered 
exercising his propriety claim to title the 
exhibition "Pop Artists "; another possibility 
was "Signs and Objects." which more clearly 
defined his curatorial aim. Both titles referred 
"to the popular sources that all these artist have 
in common, i.e.. the mass media and the 
man-made environment." Alloway passionately 
argued that the time was ripe for such an 
exhibition, noting that "interest in art of this 
kind is increasing and as it increases so do 
misunderstandings about it." He cited Max 
Kozloff's contemporaneous article 'Pop' 
Culture, Metaphysical Disgust, and the New 
Vulgarians" as an example "A seriously 
documented and carefully chosen show at this 
time would. I think, interest the public by its 
topicality and also define this area historically." 

In his proposal. Alloway systematically 
established a classification of Pop imagery into 
four categories, placing specific artists in each 

1 Fully 3-D Objects (Rauschenberg and 
Oldenburg) found objects literally present 
and plastic simulacra 2 Objects and Flat

Wesselmann, New York, ca. 1966 



Painting (Dine, Gene Beery, Ernst Trova, and 
Alex Katz): anonymous artifacts and paintings 
cut into figurative shapes; 3. Paintings of Objects 
(Thiebaud, Peter Saul, Warhol, Rosenquist, 
Stephenson [Harold Stevenson?], and Steven 
Durkee): still life and mass production, graffiti 
and abundance, Campbell Soup cans, Giantism, 
and blow-ups of anatomical detail; and 
4. Paintings of Signs (Johns, Lichtenstein, 
Ramos, Allan D'Arcangelo, Billy Al Bengston, 
Robert Indiana, and Ruscha): comic strips and 
ads, comic strip heroes, Pop materials used 
allegorically, and emblematic presentation. 

Alloway wished to distinguish between object 
makers, i.e., sculptors, and painters whose 
subject matter was objects drawn from the 
"communications network and the physical 
environment of the city." 34 He perceived the 
exhibition, when "historically viewed, [to be] 
a compact section of a wider movement which 
includes phases of Junk Culture, such as the 
collage explosion and happenings. ... My 
preference is to stress ... the painted imagery 
rather than the objects." Alloway was clear in 
his desire that the Guggenheim exhibition not 
look like "Son of the Art of Assemblage," a 
reference to William Seitz's groundbreaking 
exhibition devoted to the history of collage and 
sculptural works held at the Museum of Modern 
Art the previous year. 35 

Most important, Alloway seemed to have an 
insider's knowledge of which artists Janis 
planned to include in his forthcoming gallery 
exhibition, as well as how Janis intended to 
present them. Alloway suspected that it would 
be a jumble, referring to Janis's planned 
exhibition in his proposal as a "sloppy survey." 
For the Guggenheim exhibition, Alloway intended 
that "the catalouge could be small but should 
be packed with information" and "should 
combine the kick of topicality with art historical 
accuracy." Indeed, his essay for the Six Painters 



and the Object catalogue fulfilled this intention, 
becoming one of the most influential treatises 
on the movement, written from the perspective 
of a true insider. 

In fact, Janis's exhibition did confuse matters in 
its mixing of conceptual artists (Yves Klein and 
Daniel Buren) and assemblage artists (Jean 
Tinguely and Arman) with painters of common 
objects and signs (Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, 
and Warhol). In November, a few weeks after the 
New Realist exhibition opened, Alloway sent a 
memorandum to Messer, expressing concern 
that there were too many Pop shows on view at 
the moment, citing in New York, in addition to 
Janis's anthology, Warhol and Indiana at Stable 
Gallery and Oldenburg and Wesselmann at Green 
Gallery, as well as group shows being planned 
from Philadelphia to Pasadena. He nonetheless 
was steadfast in his belief that a clear "definition 
in opposition to the general confusion" would 
not only be welcome but was needed. Messer 
seconded his concern and urged him to press 
ahead with his plans. 36 

When Six Painters and the Object opened in 
mid-March, Alloway had narrowed his original 
concept to feature six New York-based artists 
with paintings by each that represented their 
interpretation of the object. The exhibition was 
installed in six of the eight bays on the top ramp 
of the Guggenheim museum, with each bay 
displaying five or six works of a single artist. 
Alloway began with the work of Johns, followed 
by that of Dine, Rauschenberg, Warhol, 
Lichtenstein, and Rosenquist (fig. 7). It was 
a compelling presentation and attendance 
exceeded all expectations. Two thousand 
copies of the catalogue were printed — an 
unusually high number for the time. The book 
was designed by Herbert Matter, whose work 
for Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, and the furniture 
maker Knoll made him a highly sought after 
graphic designer.

The Guggenheim began plans to travel the 
exhibition even before the show opened in 
New York. Messer canvassed other museums, 
both large and small throughout North America. 
In his letter, he advocated that "it would not be 
too much to say that [the exhibition] will attempt 
to set right the mixed presentations that have 
occurred in many places by stressing the pure 
painting forms in separation from the crowded 
assemblages of objects and other tendencies 
with which these have often been associated."' 
The responses were staggeringly quick and 
conspicuously enthusiastic. The Jocelyn Art 
Museum in Omaha. Nebraska, perceived the 
exhibition as a "most timely ('hot') subject 
and wished to participate." 38 A number of the 
institutions who expressed interest had to be 
turned away: 39 there were only seven venues 
available for travel. 40 When the exhibition reached 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Alloway 
expanded it to include six West Coast artists.' 
The lenders to the New York exhibition had been 
asked to part with their works for a year's tour. 
Most agreed, but a number did not, and Alloway 
was forced to make substitutions. Others were 
keen to come to the aid of the new art. John 
Weber of the Dwan Gallery, Los Angeles, 



recognized that many lenders, having acquired 
their works within the last two years, might be 
reticent to extend their loans and therefore 
offered a couple of paintings from the gallery's 
inventory, namely. Lichtenstein's Tzing from the 
Live Ammo series (1962) and Dines large 
Pink Bathroom (1962) ' As a result, the traveling 
exhibition was significantly different, although 
just as formidable. 

As a self-contained movement Pop art had 
dissipated by the end of the 1960s The current 
work of many of its early practitioners has 
moved away from purely Pop statements but 
continues to provide lively commentary on 
contemporary culture. Once considered a 
radical departure, their art has been thoroughly 
assimilated by the very consumer culture that 
it initially critiqued. In 1963, when the work 
was still considered risky, the Guggenheim 
staged the small but momentous Six Painters 
and the Object." The endorsement that the 
Guggenheim bestowed upon Pop art at that 
critical juncture validated the movement and. 
in turn, demonstrated the museum's leadership 
in establishing artistic trends.

NOTES 

1. In New York, Lichtenstein received monographic shows 
at the Guggenheim in 1969 and 1993-94, and a Dine 
exhibition featuring work from 1959 to 1969 was 
presented in 1999. At the behest of the Guggenheim, the 
Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin commissioned and exhibited 
in 1998 Rosenquist's The Swimmer in the Econo-mist 
(1997-98). a three-part contemporary history painting. 
Oldenburg in 1995-96, Rauschenberg in 1997-98. and 
Rosenquist forthcoming in 2003-04 had retrospectives 
organized for the Guggenheim in New York, which 
included national and international itineraries. Warhol was 
featured in several exhibitions, including one devoted to 
his Factory years (Guggenheim Museo Bilbao. 1999-2000) 
and another to his series of Last Supper paintings 
(Guggenheim Museum Soho. 1998). 

2. The Guggenheim's collection includes additional works 
by each of the eight artists featured in American Pop 
Icons, in addition to works by other Pop artists, such as 
Billy Al Bengston, Mel Ramos, Larry Rivers. Ed Ruscha, 
and George Segal. 

3. Barbara Rose was the first to identify the work of 
Rauschenberg and Johns as not necessarily Pop: "it is not 
as inappropriate to talk of them in the same breath as it is 
to associate them with 'pop art.' which has a lot to do with 
them, but with which they have nothing to do." Barbara 
Rose, "Pop Art at the Guggenheim," Art International 
(Lugano) 7. no. 5 (May 25, 1963), pp. 20-22. Art history 
has since correctly assumed this position in regard to 
Rauschenberg and Johns, e.g., see Hand-Painted Pop- 
American Art in Transition 1955-1962, exh. cat. 

(Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art. 1993). 

4. Both were included in Alloway's original exhibition 
prospectus but did not make the final cut. Whether this 
was due to space limitations— the sixth and top ramp 
of the Guggenheim spiral only has eight bays, and two 
were used for storage while the other six bays each 
showed the work of one artist — or was a curatorial 
decision is unknown.

8. Previously, Alloway had been deputy director of 
London's Institute of Contemporary Art from 1954 to 
1957. While at the Guggenheim, he organized nearly 
twenty exhibitions, including Word and Image (Dec. 8. 
1965-Jan. 2, 1966), Barnett Newman: The Stations of the 
Cross: lema sbachthani (Apr. 23-June 19, 1966), and 
Systemic Painting (Sept. 21 -Nov. 27, 1966). He resigned 
from the museum in 1966 after clashing with Messer over 
what the Guggenheim was to exhibit at the Venice 
Biennale. Alloway has written extensively on Pop art and 
the art of his time. From 1968 to 1981 he was a professor 
of art history at the State University of New York at Stony 
Brook. His principal essays are collected under the title 
Network: Art and the Complex Present (Ann Arbor: UMI 
Research Press, 1984). He died on January 2, 1990, and 
is survived by his wife, the artist Sylvia Sleigh. See An

12. Alloway received a four-month Foreign Leader's grant 
from the United States government to study American 
painting in 1958, which was his first visit. He met many 
influential people in the art world at that time, including 
the critic and art historian Eugene Goosen, who invited 
him for a one-year academic appointment in art history at 
Bennington College, Vermont (1961-62). 

13. Walter Hopps's New Painting of Common Objects, held 
at the Pasadena Museum of Art (Sept. 25-Oct. 19, 1962), 
was the first such museum exhibition.

the most respected art critic of the time, appeared on NBC 
television on March 14, 1963. As she walked through the 
Guggenheim, she compared the Pop artists to nineteenth- 
century American sign painters, American artist Stuart 
Davis, and contemporary advertisements. This sort of 
historical analysis would have pleased Alloway immensely. 

15. March 1962 seems to be when the name "Pop" 
was settled upon. See Max Kozloff, "'Pop' Culture, 
Metaphysical Disgust, and the New Vulgarians," 

Art International (Lugano) 6, no. 2 (Mar. 1962), pp. 35-36. 
The list of other terms is taken from Sidra Stitch, Made in 
USA: An Americanization in Modern Art. The '50s and 60s 
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), p. 2. 

16. The term "Pop" was misapplied to Johns and 
Rauschenberg, and artists such as Dine and Rosenquist 
bristled at the label even as their inclusion in the 
movement significantly accelerated their careers. 

17. In New York, 1962 began with a Dine show at Martha 
Jackson (Jan. 9-Feb. 3); then, came the first 
one-person shows of Rosenquist at the Green Gallery, 
(Jan. 30-Feb. 17) and Lichtenstein at Leo Castelli 

(Feb. 10-Mar. 3). Warhol's Thirty-two Campbell's Soup 
Cans were exhibition at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles 
(July 9-Aug. 4). The fall season in New York opened with 
Oldenburg's soft sculptures at the Green Gallery (Sept. 24- 
Oct. 20), followed by Sidney Janis's International 
Exhibition of the New Realists (Nov. 1-Dec. 1 ). The year 
concluded with Warhol's first New York exhibition at the 
Stable Gallery (Nov. 6-24), Wesselmann's Great American 
Nudes at the Green Gallery( Nov. 13-Dec. 1), and a 
group show of thirteen artists, My Country 'Tis of Thee 
(Nov. 18-Dec. 15) at the Dwan Gallery, Los Angeles. 

18. The Scull collection was sold at auction in 1973 when 
Robert and his wife Ethel divorced. Upon Krausher's death 
in 1967, his wife sold the collection to the German 
industrialist Karl Stroher, who died in 1988; Sotheby's sold 
the bulk of this collection in May 1989. The Tremaine 
collection was sold at auction in 1988 and 1991, while 
many Pop artworks from the Panza collection were sold to 
the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1984. 
Both the Sculls and the Tremaines were significant lenders 
to the Six Painters and the Object exhibition.

24. In a move similar to Messer's in 1962. Thomas Krens. 
the Guggenheim's current director, invited Walter Hopps to 
be senior adjunct curator of contemporary art in 2001 . In 
this capacity, he recently organized, with Sarah Bancroft, 

a Rosenquist retrospective for the museum that will tour 
internationally. At the Guggenheim, he was also the co- 
curator (with this author) of the Rauschenberg 
retrospective in 1997. After leaving the Pasadena Museum 
of Art in 1967, Hopps became director of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., from 1967 to 1972, then 
a curator at the National Collection of Fine Arts (now 
Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, DC. 
from 1972 to 1979. and director of the Menil Collection, 
Houston, from 1980 to 1988. where he is also presently 
curator of contemporary art.

public's, that validates artistic styles.

Jim Dine 

b. 1935 



Jim Dine was born June 16, 1935, in 
Cincinnati, Ohio. He studied at night at the 
Cincinnati Art Academy during his senior 
year of high school and then attended the 
University of Cincinnati, the School of the 
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Ohio 
University, Athens, from which he received his 
B.F.A. in 1957, Dine moved to New York in 
1959 and soon became a pioneer creator of 
Happenings together with Allan Kaprow, 
Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman and others. 
He exhibited at the Judson Gallery, New York, 
in 1958 and 1959, and his first solo show 
took place at the Reuben Gallery, New York, 
in 1960. 

Dine is closely associated with the 
development of Pop art in the early 1960s. 
Frequently he affixed everyday objects, such 
as tools and rope, shoes, neckties, and other 
articles of clothing, and even a bathroom sink 
to his canvases. Characteristically, these 
objects were Dine's personal possessions. 
This autobiographical content was evident in 
Dine's early Crash series of 1959-60, and 
appeared as well in subsequent bodies of 
work, such as the Palettes, Hearts, and 
bathrobe Self-Portraits. Dine has also made 
a number of three-dimensional works and 
environments, and is well-known for his 
drawings and prints. He has written and 
illustrated several books of poetry. 

In 1965 Dine was a guest lecturer at Yale 
University, New Haven, and artist-in-residence 
at Oberlin College, Ohio. He was a visiting 
artist at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 



in 1967. From 1967 to 1971 he and his family 
lived in London. Dine has been given 
numerous solo shows in museums in Europe 
and the United States. In 1970 the Whitney 
Museum of American Art, New York, organized 
a major retrospective of his work, and in 1978 
the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 
presented a retrospective of his etchings. Dine 
resides in New York and Putney, Vermont.

During the early 1960s Jim Dine was part of 
a loosely affiliated group of artists— including 
Red Grooms, Claes Oldenburg, and Lucas 
Samaras— who extended the gestural and 
subjective implications of Abstract 
Expressionist painting into outrageous 
performances, subsequently known as 
Happenings. Inspired by John Cage's radical 
approach to musical composition, which 
involved chance, indeterminacy, and an 
emphatic disregard for all artistic boundaries, 
they sought to transgress preexisting aesthetic 
values. Dine and Oldenburg brought this 
sensibility to bear on a two-artist exhibition 
called Ray-Gun, held at the Judson Gallery in 
New York in February and March 1960. For 
the show each artist made an installation 
consisting of a chaotic configuration of found 
and manipulated objects. In Dine's jumbled 
environment. The House, the walls and 
ceiling of the gallery were effaced by an 
agglomeration of painted cloth, fragmented 
domestic objects, scrawled slogans, crumbled 
paper, and suspended metal bedsprings. 
Scattered throughout were cardboard signs 
spelling out various household platitudes, 
such as "breakfast is ready" and "go to work." 
Dine claimed that the juxtaposition of these 
and other banal phrases with the surrounding 
domestic wreckage revealed the potential 



violence inherent to a home His critique of 
the myth of the happy home was amplified by 
anthropomorphic references— painted eyes, 
faces, and other body parts— that were hidden 
or lost amid the detritus. 

A year later Dine began making paintings of 
discrete items— a hat. a necktie, and the 
necklace in Pearls, composed of rubber-ball 
halves covered with metallic paint. Although 
often construed as Pop art emblems, these 
paintings, which include the names of the 
depicted objects and in some cases collage 
elements, are more conceptually oriented than 
the playful and bold appropriations of popular 
imagery made by Roy Lichtenstein, James 
Rosenquist. and Andy Warhol. By so blatantly 
and provocatively combining word, image, and 
object, Dine invited an investigation into the 
presumed difference between representation 
and reality, the construction of meaning, and 
the arbitrary nature of language — NS

Sonnabend Collection 

In 1961 Jim Dine's already introspective 
canvases began to feature a highly personal 
selection of both real and depicted articles of 
clothing, such as thickly impastoed ties, the 
front of a gargantuan coat, or an oversized 
bandanna. Embracing the array of textures and 
patterns offered by different fabrics, Dine 
employed dress as a means to project to the 
world a range of constructed identities while 
protecting his inner self from full exposure. 
His early assemblage Green Suit (1959) 
incorporated the artist's own corduroy suit 
and a phallic bulge to suggest Dine's absent 
body. In his five performance pieces from 
throughout the 1960s, the artist often 
appeared in outlandish garments — wearing a 
pigment-drenched painter's smock and clown 
makeup while performing as The Smiling 
Workman (1960), for example— that 
emphasized the constructed nature of his 
various routines. 1 

Dine's use of quotidian objects led to his 
critical association with the burgeoning 
American Pop art movement during this time, 
but the artist himself avoided such a 
classification, saying, "Pop is concerned with 
exteriors. I'm concerned with interiors." 2 His 
individual aesthetic was in opposition to the 
type of mechanically reproduced images 
appropriated from American mass culture that 
were freely used with a cool sense of irony by 
his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Tom 
Wesselmann. Taking as his point of departure 
the Abstract Expressionists' preoccupation 
with the transcendent qualities of paint, Dine 
focused upon the physicality of the canvas and 
applied his brushstrokes to the surface almost 



as if they were objects in order to achieve a 
particularly visceral aesthetic. 

As a result of a psychological crisis, which 
began in 1961, Dine began to undergo 
psychoanalysis and led a quiet existence. 
Completed within this period of isolation and 
self reflection, Shoe serves as both a reminder 
and a validation of the artist's difficult 
childhood. "I was trying to reconstruct a 
history for myself of where I came from," 3 the 
artist has explained, and the brown-and-white 
oxford evokes the elegant attire of Fred Astaire 
that was admired during Dine's youth. The 
accompanying textual label underscores the 
free association behind Dine's creative process 
("I would just say 'shoe,' and I made Shoe"' 
he remembered) while emphasizing the 
deliberately naive, childlike character of the 
composition. 5 Interested in the oscillation 
between reality and artifice as a means of 
exploring his own awareness of the extant 
world, 6 Dine affixed an actual wood shelf to 
the bottom edge of the painting. Such an 
addition emphasizes the self-referential nature 
of the canvas; the painting does not depict an 
image of a shoe, but rather the artist's own 
memory making — KVW

Four Soap Dishes. 1 962 

Oil on canvas with four metal soap dishes and 

painted wooden soaps 

48 x 40 inches 

Sonnabend Collection 

In the summer of 1962, bathroom fixtures 
such as medicine chests, towel racks, and 
sinks began to appear as elements in Dines 
paintings. Culled directly from an abundantly 
stocked hardware store in East Hampton, New 
York, where Dine and his family spent time, 
such items narrated the artist's personal 
history: As a young boy in Cincinnati, Dine 
spent his summer weekends working in 
hardware stores owned by his grandfather and 
father. He found the array of goods on display 
to be a formative aesthetic experience, 
identifying a sculptural beauty in mundane 
objects. His Bathroom series mines his 
memories and associated emotions and 
creates what might be considered oblique self- 
portraits with anonymous objects employed as 
bodily substitutions.' 

To structure these paintings, Dine looked to 
the geometric rigidity found in Piet Mondrian's 
crisp arrangements of lines and rectangles 
executed in primary colors/ A sense of this 
orderliness is present in one work from the 
Bathroom series. Four Soap Dishes, in which 
the gleaming metal trays cradling painted 
wood "soaps" extend from square patches of 
red, blue, yellow, and blackish green. Critic 
David Shapiro has suggested that such a grid, 
painted with agitated brushstrokes that remain 
confined within their rectilinear boundaries, 
provides a wry commentary upon the rigorous 
color theories of Josef Albers. which were 
ubiquitous within American art schools by the 
1960s The blocks of color may also recall the 
commercial color charts created to detail 
available hues of house paint (another 



reference to the hardware stores of the artist's 
youth) Dine began an exploration of this 
format in his Color Chart series during the 
following year 

In Dme's Bathroom paintings, elements are 
often arranged to imply a larger environment 
just beyond the picture plane, with the canvas 
suggesting a wall that extends indefinitely. 
Reflective surfaces such as mirrored cabinets 
directly engage viewers in the works, 4 a 
condition that is subtly present in Four Soap 
Dishes, which enticingly proffers its colorful 
soaps Like Dines earlier installation The 
House (1960). a chaotic accumulation of 
found objects and detritus juxtaposed with 
newly constructed artworks, the Bathroom 
paintings were not intended to mimic a 
comfortable and realistic domestic 
environment, but rather to envelop viewers 
within their phantasmal setting drawn from the 
artist's own memories Firmly rooted in the 
artistic realm, Dine's work was separate in 
intention from the assemblage constructions 
of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. 
with whom he was often compared. Rejecting 
their conviction to merge art and life. Dine 
instead noted. "I think life comes to art but if 
the object is used, then people say the obiect 
is used to bridge that gap— it's crazy. The 
object is used to make art. |ust like paint is 
used to make art " — KVW

PLATE 12 

Summer Tools, 1962 

Oil, tools, string, metal, glue bottles, and 

plastic light fixture on three joined canvases 

80 x 108 inches 

Private collection 

During the summer of 1962, Dine executed in 
rapid succession a number of canvases with 
tools either affixed to their thickly painted 
surfaces or dangling from their edges. The 
Tool series, like the Bathrooms, alludes to the 
hardware stores that Dine's family owned in 
his youth. Unlike bathroom fixtures, tools have 
become endemic to Dine's practice during the 
last four decades. Identifying a human trace 
within their very structures, Dine employs 
tools as veiled surrogates for his own body 
and has explained his long-standing 
veneration as follows: "A tool can be inspiring. 
Not just because it's some sort of phallic 
symbol, but because the tool is a beautiful 
object in itself, it has been refined to be an 
extension of one's hand, over the centuries, in 
a process of evolution." 1 Although they relate 
to his own experiences, the paintings are not 
as openly personal as Dine's earlier works. 
Instead, he intended the canvases to provoke 
individual reactions from each viewer. "I use 
only new things that are familiar, such as 
hammers, pliers, etc., so that there will be no 
confusion about the mystery the viewer brings 
to the picture," 3 Dine has explained. 

The Tool series details the labor of Dine's 
artistic process. Summer Tools bears the 
hammer, screwdriver, and glue that might have 
been used in its own construction, while 
additional elements, such as a light-switch 
cover and rope, suggest similar paintings that 
Dine created with quite similar objects. While 
other canvases from the series juxtapose 
actual tools with their painted silhouettes to 
imply action, tools are hung from or attached 



to the minimally painted surface of Summer 
Tool to suggest a suspension in the creative 
process. Playing on this suggestion of motion, 
the barren background of Summer Tools 
functions as a stage set for its elements that 
seem about to hammer, scrub, or cut their 
paths across the surface. "I was skirting the 
issue of painting and making a kind of 
inanimate theater," 3 he has said of the Tool 
paintings. Dine has also related this approach 
to his 1960 Vaudeville Collage performance, in 
which leafy vegetables tossed onto an empty 
stage appeared to come to life as actors.' 

Dine has cited the influence of fifteenth- 
century Flemish painting upon these 
compositional arrangements, likening his 
intimate groups of inanimate objects to the 
Flemish depictions of human subjects within 
tightly contained pictorial spaces. 5 It has been 
noted that the formal organization of Dine's 
Tool works from this period anticipate a group 
of abstract landscapes that the artist would 
complete in 1963. b Indeed, the splashes of 
color and objects that appear at the top of 
Summer Tools seem to emerge as if figures on 
a distant horizon, moving into the empty 
foreground. — KVW

Jasper Johns 

b. 1930 



Jasper Johns was born May 15. 1930. in 
Augusta. Georgia, and was raised in South 
Carolina. In the fall ot 1947 he enrolled at the 
University of South Carolina, Columbia, to 
study art but left in December 1948 to attend 
the Parsons School of Design, New York, from 
January to June 1949. Drafted into the United 
States Army, Johns served from May 1951 to 
late 1952 in South Carolina, where he operated 
the Fort Jackson Gallery, exhibiting artworks 
made by fellow soldiers. After a period of 
service in Japan, Johns returned to New York, 
where he met fellow artist Robert 
Rauschenberg in late 1953. 

Regarded as an important bridge between 
Abstract Expressionism and Pop art and 
Minimalism. Johns and Rauschenberg worked 
in close proximity until 1961. Johns was also 
significantly influenced by his friendships with 
John Cage and Merce Cunningham (for whom 
he designed sets and costumes and acted as 
artistic adviser from 1967 to 1980) and by his 
admiration for Marcel Duchamp. In late 1954. 
Johns began to use encaustic to depict flags, 
targets, maps, numerals, and letters, treating 
these familiar motifs without recourse to 
illusionism. and emphasizing the painting's 
physical presence as an object. In some 
paintings he incorporated actual three- 
dimensional forms, such as a ball, a book, 
or a stretcher. 

Johns's first solo exhibition was held at the 
Leo Castelli Gallery. New York, in January 
1958. the success of which firmly established 
his career. He began to work with Sculp-metal 
in 1958 and to make cast-bronze sculptures 
in 1960. when he also started to explore 
printmakmg. His first retrospective was held 
in 1964 at the Jewish Museum, New York He 
continued to develop important motifs in his 
work, including the map of the United States 
and the flagstone and Crosshatch patterns. 



which allowed him to explore concepts of 
literalness. repetition, order, and patterning. 
In 1972 Johns established a home and studio 
on the island of Saint Martin A retrospective 
organized by the Whitney Museum of 
American Art traveled, after its New York 
showing, to Europe. Japan, and San Francisco 
during 1977 and 1978. 

In the 1980s Johns began to explore illusion 
through the use of trompe loeil and the 
inclusion of "trick" images adopted from 
perceptual psychology. Recent paintings have 
addressed the seasons and his own career 
Some have included imagistic references to 
paintings by Paul Cezanne. Matthias 
Griinewald. and Hans Holbein A retrospective 
organized by the Museum of Modern Art. New 
York, in 1996-97. traveled to Germany and 
Japan. Johns lives and works in New York. 
Saint Martin, and Connecticut.

PLATE 2 

Flashlight I. 1958 

Sculp-metal over flashlight and wood 
5 1 /i x 9 1 /b x 3 7 /s inches 
Sonnabend Collection 

From the mid-1950s, Jasper Johns developed 
a pictorial repertory based on familiar, 
everyday signs: targets, numbers, and 
American flags. In his first Flag painting of 
1954-55, the edges of the flag coincide 
exactly with those of the canvas support. 
By eliminating the traditional figure-ground 
relationship in painting, Johns muddled the 
boundaries between real object and art object: 
Flag functions at once as national symbol, 
reproduction, and work of art. Such 
coexistence of object and representation had 
further implications in a group of small 
sculptures of lightbulbs and flashlights Johns 
completed in 1958. 

Flashlight I is one of the artist's experiments 
with Sculp-metal, a substance made from vinyl 
resin mixed with aluminum powder that can be 
modeled like clay but hardens into metal. In 
making the piece, Johns took an actual 
flashlight and covered it with Sculp-metal, 
then re-created its surface details by hand. 
The covering, however, is not complete, and 
the bulb and glass of the actual flashlight 
remain visible, essentially standing in for 
themselves. In making sculptures that both are 
and are not the thing itself, Johns creates a 
perceptual conundrum, and, much as Marcel 
Duchamp's readymades do, raises questions 
about the status of the art object, the 
relationship between the handmade and the 
mass-produced, and what is necessary to 
distinguish a sculpture from ordinary nonart 
things. What differentiates Johns's practice 
from that of Duchamp, whom he greatly 



admired, is that whereas Duchamp presented 
his readymades largely as he found them, 
altering only their position and context, Johns 
materially transforms his chosen objects. The 
surface of the flashlight bears the clear marks 
of physical handling, conveying a strong sense 
of authorship and manipulation. In accordance 
with sculptural tradition, Johns positions his 
form on a base, literally elevating its status 
from mundane everyday tool to work of art.

PLATE 3 

Figure 8. 1 959 

Encaustic on canvas 
20Vi6 x 15 inches 
Sonnabend Collection 

In 1959, the same year Jasper Johns painted 
Figure 8, he made the following statement: 
"I am opposed to painting which is concerned 
with conceptions ot simplicity." This 
declaration might at first seem to be 
contradicted by this work's "simple" subject 
matter: a stenciled, painted number eight. But 
it reveals the acute sensitivity of Johns's 
approach. Familiar, oft-repeated forms can 
offer both artist and viewer an interest so 
profound as to render irrelevant any 
comparison with allegedly more complex or 
"original" subjects. By infusing ostensibly 
plain graphic symbols with intense visual 
incident and play. Johns's work points to the 
inadequacy of this conventional opposition. 

Encaustic, a mixture of hot beeswax and 
pigment that was used in ancient Roman 
frescoes and the American crafts alike, is the 
pasty medium of Figure 8's extraordinarily 
worked surface. Dense patches of vibrant 
Crayola primaries— deep blue, true red, and 
orange-yellow are interspersed across the 
curves of the numeral. Underneath the patchy, 
whitish background lie traces of these same 
primary colors and a few isolated clippings of 
matted-down newspaper. Throughout his work 
with numbers, letters, and other familiar 
symbols, Johns maintained the appearance 
of traced stencils and copied-out figures In 
Figure 5 some of the brushstrokes just 
outside the eight echo its curves very closely, 
as if to suggest that the artist had repeatedly 
traced the figure At the same time, several 
white vertical drips appear like frozen 
brushstrokes— an effect heightened by the 
use of encaustic, which hardens into a thick. 



waxy consistency as it dries Like that of the 
Abstract Expressionists who dominated the 
New York art world when Johns began 
showing his work in 1958. his painting 
technique stresses the immediate, material 
reality of its medium But the introduction 
of subject matter and the use of encaustic— 
a medium that requires meticulous care- 
distance Johns's work from the spontaneity 
of the New York School. 

Since the beginning of his career. Johns has 
experimented with generic forms familiar to 
almost any viewer: flags, maps, numbers. 
letters, and targets. Instead of representing 
objects from the world and using painterly 
devices such as perspective to create the 
illusion of three-dimensional space, Johns 
paints symbols and signs directly on the 
canvas. There is no "original" number eight 
that served as a model for this painting Johns 
thus subtly but irreversibly alters the function 
of artistic subject matter by using it to 
encourage us to reconsider precisely those 
things we thought we already knew, mining 
the potential richness of a range of familiar, 
mass-produced visual forms— RH

Fool's House, 1962 

Oil on canvas with broom, fabric, wood, 

and porcelain cup 

72 x 36 inches 

Collection of Jean Christophe Castelli 

Following the success of his first solo 
exhibition with the Leo Castelli Gallery in 
1958, Jasper Johns's painting changed 
significantly. Actual objects, which were often 
movable, were increasingly introduced into his 
work, appropriating the space in front of the 
canvas and again calling attention to the 
painting as it exists as both a two- and three- 
dimensional form. Some critics had labeled 
Johns's work Neo-Dada, which sparked his 
interest in, and later friendship with Marcel 
Duchamp. Both artists were concerned with 
the visual and intellectual experience of the 
viewer before a work of art, and, rather than 
seeking to create an illusion of space, sought 
to refer to the space actually inhabited by the 
viewer. More aggressive brushstrokes also 
began to appear in Johns's work at this time, 
together with stenciled letters and numbers 
and a restricted palette including whites, 
blacks, and grays. The physical characteristics 
of painting and explicit references to studio 
practice became central as well, and even 
provided subject matter and sources of 
imagery. Overall, a more somber, darker 
emotional tone prevailed in these works of 
the early 1960s. 

Fool's House shows these developing 
concerns. The found objects may relate to 
Duchamp, but here Johns's household items 
assume an artistic function, becoming studio 
tools. The broom serves as paintbrush, the 
towel as paint rag, and the dangling cup as 
a receptacle for paint. Fool's House a\so 
evidences Johns's interest in the relations 
between art, language, and the world; it 



includes both handwritten labels pointing to 
the objects included (reinforcing his use of 
"real" objects rather than the use of trompe 
I'oeil painting techniques) and the stenciled 
title of the work itself. The title, however, is 
split, and would meet up only if the painting 
were cylindrical in form. This, as well as the 
presence of a small wood stretcher on the 
front of the canvas and the cup hanging down, 
suggests a preoccupation with more complex 
spatial relations beyond the dimensions of the 
work itself. The use of elements from the 
studio and imagery derived from imprinting 
and smearing — as implied in the traces of the 
broom's movements— appear elsewhere in 
Johns's work and indicate the artist's deeper 
consideration of his process and 
environment. — LMcM

flags. 1987 

Encaustic and newspaper on canvas 

25'/2 x 33 inches 

Collection of the artist 

Jasper Johns began his first flag painting in 
1954, after dreaming of painting an American 
flag. Completely filling the picture plane. 
Johns's "flag" collapsed the figure-ground 
relationship, raising questions about the 
possible coalescence of an object and its 
representation. Further ambiguities arose 
about the use of such a politically charged 
symbol and the artist's intention in employing 
it at that time, though Johns has stated that a 
painting of a flag is as much about the 
physicality of painting as it is about a flag. 
He also claimed that the use of such familiar 
imagery as flags, targets, and maps allowed 
him to work on other levels, and to 
concentrate on process. Indeed, the original 
Flag (1954-55) shows much experimentation 
in technique and is rendered in encaustic 
(pigment suspended in beeswax) over oil paint 
and collaged newspaper. 

The flag became emblematic in Johns' 
practice, and he has returned to it on many 
occasions, changing or manipulating the 
color and rendering its image in various 
mediums, from graphite to ink and even 
bronze. In this work dating from 1987. Johns 
returns to the technique of the original flag 
painting and to the American flag's true colors, 
this time doubling the image and orienting the 
flags vertically rather than horizontally The 
flags here, however, are mirror images of the 
American flag and represent a subtle 
reordering or manipulation of a by-now 
familiar emblem in the artist's work. 



As with the first Flag, the political significance 
of the gesture of reordering and reassembling 
such an important national symbol is again 
ambiguous. In his repeated depictions of this 
and other familiar cultural signs. Johns in 
some ways anticipated the concerns of Pop 
art and signaled a move away from Abstract 
Expressionism. His consistently painterly 
treatment of the subject, however, and 
constant reworking of the flag in a variety of 
mediums evidence other preoccupations.

Roy Lichtenstein 

1923-1997 



Roy Lichtenstein was born October 27, 1923, 
in New York. In 1939 he studied under 
Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League in 
New York, and the following year under Hoyt 
Sherman at the School of Fine Arts at Ohio 
State University, Columbus. He served in the 
United States Army from 1943 to 1946, after 
which he resumed his studies and was hired 
as an instructor. He obtained an M.F.A. degree 
in 1949. In 1951 the Carlebach Gallery, New 
York, organized a solo exhibition of his 
semiabstract paintings of the Old West. 
Shortly thereafter, the artist moved to 
Cleveland, where he continued painting while 
working as an engineering draftsman to 
support his growing family. 

From 1957 to 1960 Lichtenstein held a 
teaching position at the New York State 
College of Education, Oswego. By then he 
had begun to include loosely drawn cartoon 
characters in his increasingly abstract 
canvases. From 1960 to 1963, he lived in 
New Jersey while teaching at Douglass 
College, a division of Rutgers University in 
New Brunswick. He met artists such as Jim 
Dine, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Lucas 
Samaras, George Segal, and Robert Whitman, 
who were experimenting in diverse ways with 
the interrelationships of art and everyday 
life. In 1961 he began to make paintings 
consisting exclusively of comic-strip figures, 
and introduced his Benday-dot grounds, 
lettering, and speech balloons; he also started 
incorporating cropped images from 
advertisements in his works. From 1964 into 
the 1970s he successively depicted stylized 
landscapes and adaptations of paintings by 
famous artists, geometric elements from Art 
Deco design (the Modern series) and parodies 



of the Abstract Expressionists' style (the 
Brushstroke series). They all underlined the 
contradictions of representing three 
dimensions on a flat surface. 

In the early 1970s he explored this formal 
question further with his abstract Mirrors and 
Entablatures series. From 1974 into the 1980s 
he probed another long-standing issue: the 
concept of artistic style. All his series of works 
played with the characteristics of well-known 
twentieth-century art movements. Lichtenstein 
continued to question the role of style in 
consumer culture in his 1990s series of 
Interiors, which included images of his own 
works as decorative elements. 

Since 1962 Lichtenstein's work has been 
represented by Leo Castelli Gallery, New York. 
He participated in the Venice Biennale in 1966, 
and was honored with solo exhibitions in 
1967 and 1968 at the Pasadena Art Museum 
and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 
New York, respectively. The artist was the 
subject of a major retrospective at the 
Guggenheim in 1994, three years before his 
death on September 30, 1997.

Sonnabend Collection 

Roy Lichtenstein helped usher in the Pop art 
movement in the United States in the 1960s. 
Inspired by popular culture and mass media, 
he made artworks with a new focus on urban 
culture, exploring the United States and its 
people in terms of familiar imagery from 
everyday life. With his large-scale paintings of 
comic-book panels and his deadpan renditions 
of advertisements, Lichtenstein celebrated and 
critiqued some of the more absurd aspects of 
American society and created a composite 
portrait of consumerism . 

Lichtenstein began making paintings of 
cartoon characters, comic-strip panels, and 
generic advertising imagery in 1961. In the 
same year, he experimented with the diptych 
format, using it first for paintings based on 
newspaper and magazine ads. Turning to 
postwar romance comic books, Lichtenstein 
culled imagery, plot, and visual elements such 
as the medium's characteristic speech 
balloons, expanses of flat color, and extreme 
close-ups. In Eddie Diptych, Lichtenstein 
isolated the heroine's internal dialogue on 
one panel, revealing the drama beneath the 
unemotional stares and cliched exchange in 
the scene played out on the larger canvas. 

Borrowing conventions associated with 
commercial printing processes — sharp black 
outlines, a few bold colors, and Benday dots — 
Lichtenstein fused fine-art production with the 
appearance of mass production The grid of 
dots that comprises the women's skin in this 
work mimics the thousands of dots used to 
create expanses of color by inexpensive 
printing methods After experimenting with 



making these imitation Benday dots with a 
brush and a handmade stencil, he switched in 
1963 to a manufactured screen that allowed 
for more precise results. 

Yet he recognized the artifice of his task: 
"I want my art to look programmed or 
impersonal, but I don't believe I'm being 
impersonal while I do it." Lichtenstem's 
painted versions of these scenes are 
considerably altered from the original sources 
He reduced realistic details, simplified 
narratives, and recomposed the subjects, often 
combining elements from numerous frames 
into one. and ultimately achieved in the 
idealized, iconic look that came to define the 
most successful of the 1960s comic books 
Complicating the idea that Pop elevates mass 
culture to high art. Lichtenstem's work also 
underscores the art qualities of the materials 
of everyday life.— TB

PLATE 14 

Compositions II, 1 964 

Oil on canvas 
54 x 47 1 /4 inches 
Sonnabend Collection 

For many critics who championed Abstract 
Expressionism in the 1940s and 1950s, the 
advent of Pop art constituted a violation of the 
accepted canon of Modernism, which held that 
true avant-garde art evolved toward a greater 
and greater degree of abstraction. In its return 
to representation, Pop's object-centered 
images appeared regressive. They were 
considered a throwback to the rigidity of 
Social Realism of the 1930s rather than a 
continuation of the Utopian ideals ascribed to 
the emotive abstractions of Jackson Pollock 
and Mark Rothko. By calling attention to what 
they considered indifferent transcriptions of 
found imagery, critics such as Clement 
Greenberg and Max Kozloff dismissed Pop 
artists wholesale. In 1962 Kozloff wrote, "Save 
us from the 'uncharmers,' or permutations 
thereof, the Rosensteins or the Oldenquists 
to come!"' 

For Roy Lichtenstein, the relationship between 
Pop and abstraction was more complicated 
than the critics' interpretation. Some works 
from the early 1960s depict household 
objects — an electric extension cord or the 
Roto-Broil electric cooker, for example— culled 
from newspaper or telephone-book 
advertisements. In these crude graphics, 
where details were reduced to dots, dashes, 
and lines, Lichtenstein found forms connected 
to Piet Mondrian's grids and Fernand Leger's 
machine paintings of the 1920s and 1930s. 

Lichtenstein painted a series depicting black 
and white composition notebooks in 1964-65. 
Unlike his single-object paintings in which the 
featured item— a jeweled brooch or a golf 
ball— floats against a patterned or blank 



background, the Compositions canvases are 
filled edge to edge with their motif. As with 
Jasper Johns's flags or targets, the notebook 
and the canvas merge; the painting is seen as 
object and vice versa, blurring distinctions 
between representation and abstraction. 
Lichtenstein's characteristic deadpan humor is 
evidenced in the parallels between the overall 
patterning of the marbleized notebook covers 
and Pollock's allover drip paintings, as well as 
the blank lines below the title "compositions," 
which, like so many untitled but numbered 
Abstract Expressionist compositions, is open- 
ended and vague. 

The critics' idea that abstraction could 
somehow be pure and unfettered by the real 
world was undermined by the similarities and 
analogies Lichtenstein recognized — and even 
poked fun at— in both abstraction and sources 
from popular culture. Compositions II 
ultimately takes as its subject the artificiality 
of artistic representation and questions the 
role of art in the twentieth century. The wit 
and strength of Lichtenstein's work lies in its 
ability to subvert and recontextualize the 
familiar. By employing nonart images in "high" 
art places, Lichtenstein challenges us to 
redefine how we see the world.— TB

In 1963 Roy Lichtenstein defended Pop art 
against its critics, contending that "there are 
certain things that are usable, forceful, and 
vital about commercial art." By choosing 
comic-book illustrations as a theme, and using 
simulated Benday dots to suggest cheap 
printing, Lichtenstein acknowledged (and 
perhaps questioned) the role of this popular 
form of entertainment in daily life. 

While continuing to use the conventions of 
comics and advertisements, the artist also 
cultivated imagery from the history of art. 
In Preparedness he used the Benday-dot 
technique to make a wall-size painting that 
suggests the machine paintings of Fernand 
Leger and the WPA artists of the 1930s, who 
painted monumental murals, readable at a 
distance, on themes of workers and everyday 
life. Lichtenstein followed this practice to an 
ironic and somewhat subversive end. Painted 
during a year when public opinion regarding 
the Vietnam War shifted dramatically. 
Lichtenstein's massive depiction of machinery 
and soldiers probes the conventions of selling 
the promises of the military-industrial 
complex, while quietly alluding to the naive 
optimism underlying a call to arms. 

Lichtenstein often focused on the way 
his traditional and mass-media sources 
resolved the dilemmas of representing three 
dimensions on a flat picture plane, 
incorporating their solutions into his own work 
with witty exaggeration Preparedness plays 



the fragmented. Cubist-collage space of Leger 
against comic-strip modes of suggesting form 
and the surface quality of objects. 

Lichtenstein's inclusion of an airplane window 
in the third panel of the work foreshadows 
his engagement with modes of conveying the 
illusion of reflective glass, which he would 
explore in a series of paintings of mirrors.

At first glance, Surrealism would seem to be a 
subject so remote from Roy Lichtenstein's 
own formal concerns as to offer him too little 
to work with. However, Lichtenstein's overview 
of twentieth-century art and his affinity for 
historicism propelled him to explore several 
art movements with which he seemingly had 
little in common. What attracted him to 
Surrealism was its orthodoxy; it contained 
within it, like comic strips or consumer- 
product ads, the seeds of stereotype, as does 
any form of art or culture when it is carried to 
an extreme. Thus Lichtenstein took 
Surrealism's style and techniques as the 
subject for a painting series in the 1970s. 

His Surrealist-inspired imagery was often 
based on that of Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and 
particularly Rene Magritte. Magritte frequently 
created a trompe-l'oeil world in which a figure 
or object is pictured in a scale that is at odds 
with the others in the painting. In most of his 
canvases, the figures and objects appear as 
though they could step out of the stage space 
they inhabit and enter the domain of the 
spectator. Magritte also took pleasure in the 
incongruity of metamorphosis, showing a fish 
being transformed into a woman, a pair of 
boots into feet. Because of his interests in 
trompe I'oeil and transformation, Magritte's art 
was ready-made material for Lichtenstein. In 
Girl with Tear I, he borrows several motifs 
from Magritte, including an eye similar to that 
in The False Mirror (1928). 

Merely to duplicate such works would produce 
a pastiche of Surrealism; instead Lichtenstein 



merged prototypical subjects and motifs from 
one or more Surrealists with pictorial elements 
from his own oeuvre, creating a new set of 
images in which the underlying theme is 
Surrealist. In this painting, he appropriated the 
image of a melted pocket watch from Dali's 
signal painting The Persistence of Memory 
(1931) and transformed it into the "melting" 
tear that falls from the girl's eye. 

Girl with Tear I is one of three related works 
he made the same year (the others are 
Landscape with Figures and Female Head). 
These works present us with Lichtenstein's 
interpretation of Surrealism's vocabulary 
and the deeply recessed space of Giorgio de 
Chirico or Dali, while recalling his own 
paintings of female figures of the early 1960s.

Claes Oldenburg 

b. 1929 



Claes Oldenburg was born January 28, 1929 in 
Stockholm. His father was a diplomat, and the 
family lived in the United States and Norway 
before settling in Chicago in 1936. Oldenburg 
studied literature and art history at Yale 
University, New Haven, from 1946 to 1950. He 
subsequently studied art under Paul Weighardt 
at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1950 to 
1954. During the first two years of art school, 
he also worked as an apprentice reporter at 
the City News Bureau of Chicago. Afterward he 
opened a studio, where he made magazine 
illustrations and easel paintings. Oldenburg 
eventually became an American citizen in 
December 1953. 

In 1957 he moved to New York and met 
several artists who were doing early 
performance work, including George Brecht, 
Allan Kaprow, George Segal, and Robert 
Whitman. Oldenburg likewise became a 
prominent figure in Happenings and 
performance art during the late 1950s and 
early 1960s. In 1959 the Judson Gallery, New 
York, exhibited a series of Oldenburg's 
enigmatic images, ranging from monstrous 
human figures to everyday objects, made from 
a mix of drawings, collages, and papier- 
mache. In 1961, he opened The Store, a 
re-creation of the environment of the shops in 
his downtown Manhattan neighborhood. He 
displayed familiar objects made out of plaster, 
reflecting American society's celebration of 
consumption, and was soon heralded as an 
important Pop artist with critics' recognition of 
the movement in 1962. 

Oldenburg realized his first outdoor public 
monument in 1967 in the form of a Conceptual 
performance/action behind the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, New York. As a protest against 
the Vietnam War. he had a crew dig a 
rectangular hole in the ground the size of a 
grave and then refill it. Beginning in the mid- 



1960s he also proposed colossal art proiects 
for several cities, and by 1969 his first such 
iconic work, Lipstick (Ascending) on 
Caterpillar Tracks, was installed at Yale 
University. Most of his large-scale projects 
were made with the collaboration of Coosje 
van Bruggen, whom he married in 1977. In 
the mid-1970s and again in the 1990s 
Oldenburg and van Bruggen collaborated with 
the architect Frank 0. Gehry, eroding the 
boundaries between architecture and 
sculpture. In 1991 Oldenburg and van Bruggen 
executed a binocular-shaped sculpture- 
building as part of Gehry's Chiat/Day offices 
in Los Angeles. 

Over the past three decades Oldenburg's 
works have been the focus of numerous 
performances and exhibitions. In 1985 // 
Corso del Coltello was performed in Venice. 
Italy. It included the Knife Ship I. a giant Swiss 
Army knife equipped with oars; for the 
performance the ship was set afloat in front of 
the Arsenale in an attempt to combine art. 
architecture, and theater. Knife Ship /traveled 
to several museums throughout America and 
Europe from 1986 to 1988. Oldenburg was 
honored with a solo exhibition of his work at 
the Museum of Modern Art. New York, in 
1969, and with a retrospective organized by 
the National Gallery of Art, Washington. DC. 
and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.

Claes Oldenburg's absorption with the 
commonplace was first manifest in his 
personal collection of toys, plastic food, and 
kitschy knickknacks. These objects served as 
prototypes for the pieces the artist included in 
his early Happenings and installations. Such 
sculptural articles played a more central role 
in Oldenburg's fabricated environment The 
Store (1961), in one version of which he filled 
a Manhattan storefront with colorfully painted 
simulations of ordinary items — including 
articles of clothing (lingerie, in particular) and 
sundry food products— which he sold as 
merchandise. Because of its conflation of 
creativity with commerce, The Store is often 
cited as a definitive moment in the emergence 
of Pop art. 

The lumpy wares sold at The Store, and their 
later incarnations as large-scale, stuffed vinyl 
sculptures such as this pay telephone, may be 
seen as substitutions for and references to the 
human body. Through their malleable forms 
and susceptibility to the effects of gravity, 
these supple sculptures often suggest specific 
anatomical parts: Hamburgers are breasts, a 
tube of toothpaste is a phallus. Passive and 
limp, but potentially arousable, the pieces 



allude to the sexual, a realm that has been 
repressed in much Modern, abstract art. By 
asserting the sensual through the mundane, 
Oldenburg explores the ways in which 
everyday objects are so much an extension of 
ourselves. Anyone familiar with Sigmund 
Freud's interpretation of dreams, in which 
domestic items are surrogates for human 
anatomy, will find a similar equation in 
Oldenburg's art. As the artist has said, "I never 
make representations of bodies but of things 
that relate to bodies so that the body 
sensation is passed along to the spectator 
either literally or by suggestion." — IMS

Claes Oldenburg's monumental environmental 
work The Store (1961) was just the beginning 
of his preoccupation with common, everyday 
objects and their reconfiguration as artworks. 
The sculptural items displayed in The Store— a 
wedge of pie. little girls' dresses, a shirt and 
tie, a pair of sneakers, to name just a few- 
were generally made from hardened burlap or 
muslin-coated plaster, often affixed to wire 
frames and covered with drippy enamel paint. 
Toward the end of that project. Oldenburg 
began using softer, more flexible materials to 
render similar items. These soft works are just 
that— pliable forms constructed from durable 
but malleable materials such as canvas or 
vinyl, stuffed with foam rubber or kapok 
(silky, natural fibers used as filling for things 
like sleeping bags). In 1962 Oldenburg 
exhibited his first three soft works, along with 
some of the inventory from The Store, in an 
exhibition at the Green Gallery. New York. 
Their pieces had been cut from patterns of his 
design and sewn by his wife at that time. Pat 
Oldenburg. On view were a slice of layer cake, 
a hamburger, and an ice-cream cone, all 
rendered on an exaggerated scale and placed 
directly on the floor. 

What Oldonburg was seeking to do with The 
Store was to revive the human element in 
contemporary urban experience It is this 
impulse toward humanizing our environment 
and the objects that fill it that strongly informs 
Oldenburg's soft sculptures and other art of 
the early and mid-1960s. In concentrating on 
domestic interiors, appliances, and plumbing 



fixtures, Oldenburg created a group of 
sculptures of mechanized or electrical items: a 
typewriter, pay telephone, electrical outlet, and 
light switches. He made three versions of each 
in different sizes and forms: hard. soft, and 
what the artist called a "ghost" version, like 
this Light Switch, which also exists in painted 
wood and metal as well as supple red vinyl. 
Oldenburg would often make ghost versions 
as prototypes for the vinyl works because the 
seams of the vinyl pieces were too difficult to 
rip out if they needed to be adjusted and 
resewn. He came to regard these studies as 
works in themselves, and considered the 
white-painted fabric maquettes "more 
spiritual" incarnations of his soft forms He 
would occasionally create the ghost version 
after executing a work in vinyl. 

The industrial products that Oldenburg turned 
to at this time have nothing soft about them— 
indeed, sculpture as defined and sanctioned by 
the Modernist canon is not supposed to be 
soft. It was this profound alteration of 
sculptural form that so influenced younger 
artists in the 1960s, such as Eve Hesse. With 
their skinlike surfaces and undeniably bodily 
associations. Oldenburg's soft sculptures 
nudge the latent corporeality of obiects into 
the more ambiguous, but less illusory, realm 
of real experience— MD

Robert Rauschenberg 

b. 1925 



Robert Rauschenberg was born Milton 
Rauschenberg on October 22, 1925, in 
Port Arthur, Texas. He began to study 
pharmacology at the University of Texas at 
Austin before being drafted into the United 
States Navy, where he served as a 
neuropsychiatric technician in the Navy 
Hospital Corps, San Diego. In 1947 he enrolled 
at the Kansas City Art Institute, and the 
following year traveled to Paris to study at 
the Academie Julian. 

In the fall of 1948 he returned to the United 
States to study under Josef Albers at Black 
Mountain College, near Asheville, North 
Carolina, which he continued to attend 
intermittently through 1952. While taking 
classes at the Art Students League, New York, 
from 1949 to 1951, Rauschenberg was offered 
his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons 
Gallery. Among the works he produced in this 
period are his blueprints, monochromatic 
white paintings, and black paintings. From fall 

1952 to spring 1953 he traveled to Europe and 
North Africa with Cy Twombly, whom he had 
met at the Art Students League. During his 
travels Rauschenberg worked on a series of 
small collages, hanging assemblages, and 
small boxes filled with found elements, which 
he exhibited in Rome and Florence. 

Upon his return to New York in 1953 
Rauschenberg completed his series of black 
paintings, using newspaper as the ground, and 
began to make sculptures created from wood, 
stones, and other materials found on the 
streets; paintings with tissue paper, dirt, or 
gold leaf; and more conceptually oriented 
works such as Automobile Tire Print and 
Erased de Kooning Drawing. By the end of 

1953 he had begun his Red Painting series of 
canvases that incorporate newspapers, fabric, 
and found objects. These evolved in 1954 into 
the Combines, a term Rauschenberg coined for 



his now well-known works that integrated 
aspects of painting and sculpture and include 
such objects as a stuffed eagle or goat, street 
signs, or a quilt and pillow. In late 1953 he 
met Jasper Johns. The two are considered the 
most influential artists among those who 
reacted against Abstract Expressionism in the 
mid-1950s. Johns and Rauschenberg had 
neighboring studios, regularly exchanging 
ideas and discussing their work, until 1961. 

Rauschenberg began to silkscreen paintings 
in 1962. The following year he had his first 
career retrospective, organized by the Jewish 
Museum, New York, and was awarded the 
Grand Prize in Painting at the 1964 Venice 
Biennale. He spent much of the remainder of 
the 1960s dedicated to more collaborative 
projects including printmaking, performance, 
choreography, set design, and art and 
technology works. In 1966 he cofounded 
Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T), 
an organization that sought to promote 
collaborations between artists and engineers. 

In 1970 Rauschenberg established a 
permanent residence and studio in Captiva, 
Florida, where he still lives. A retrospective 
organized by the National Collection of Fine 
Arts, Washington, D.C., traveled throughout 
the United States in 1976-78. Rauschenberg 
himself continued to travel widely, embarking 
on a number of collaborations with artisans 
and workshops abroad, which culminated in 
the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture 
Interchange (ROCI) project from 1985 to 1991. 
In 1997-98 the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum, New York, and Guggenheim Museum 
Soho exhibited the largest retrospective of 
Rauschenberg's work to date, which traveled 
to Houston and Europe in 1998-99.

Sonnabend Collection 

Robert Rauschenberg's celebrated Combines, 
begun in the mid-1950s, fused two- 
dimensional painting and three-dimensional 
sculpture. These works brought real-world 
images and objects into the realm of abstract 
painting and subverted sanctioned divisions 
between painting and sculpture. Realized in 
essentially two formats — as Combine 
paintings, like Canyon, and freestanding 
Combines— this seminal body of work would 
occupy the artist until 1962, when he 
returned to two-dimensional painting with 
the introduction of the silkscreen process. 
The full range of Rauschenberg's artistic 
vocabulary — a sense of temporality; the use 
of grid formats; doublings, mirrorings. and 
reversals; and a feel for human scale — 
appears throughout the Combines. 

The central element of Canyon is a taxidermic 
bald eagle presented to Rauschenberg by his 
friend, fellow artist Sari Dienes, who lived and 
worked in the studios above Carnegie Hall in 
Manhattan. Found in the garbage outside her 
building, this emblem of American freedom 
had belonged to one of her neighbors, a 
former member of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough 
Riders. The startling inclusion of three- 
dimensional animal forms in the Combines 
first occurred in an untitled work from 1954; 
this unique approach to the manipulation of 
the picture plane reached its apogee with 
Canyon and Monogram (1955-59) 



As Rauschenberg was at work on Canyon, he 
became preoccupied with a series of solvent 
transfer drawings (a process invented by him) 
based on the thirty-four cantos of Dante's 
Inferno, a project that would take him two and 
a half years to complete. His interest in late 
medieval literature was coupled at this time 
with an awareness of Greek mythology, which 
found expression in a loosely grouped series 
of Combines: Three Traps for Medea. Gift 
for Apollo, Pail for Ganymede, and Canyon 
(all 1959). 

Canyon references the episode in Greek 
mythology in which Zeus, in the form of an 
eagle, offers Ganymede, a youth of great 
beauty, to the gods as a cup bearer. In the 
Combine painting, the bald eagle, covered in 
black paint, perches on a cardboard box that 
in turn is balanced on a piece of wood 
suggesting a branch, from which hangs a 
pillow. Above the eagle's head is an 
assortment of cut and torn commercial 
graphics and newspaper clippings. Various 
photographic reproductions, many in the 
form of postcards or images cut from 
contemporary magazines, depict the Statue of 
Liberty and the night sky with Jupiter clearly 
visible. These, as well as the applied elements, 
including a tin can. quote Ganymede's legend 
As is typical of his Combines. Rauschenberg 
here incorporated personal elements, such as 
the photograph taken by the artist of his infant 
son Christopher reaching upward and the 
vintage photograph of his parents' car (modes 
of transportation are common themes in 
Rauschenberg's work) Some critics have 
interpreted this Combine as a veiled coding of 
homoerotism The artist has decidedly rejected 
this reading— SD

Sonnabend Collection 

Dubbed Combines by their creator, the large- 
scale assemblages that Robert Rauschenberg 
began making in 1954 are among his most 
celebrated works. Bed (1955) features 
dramatic, gestural drips of paint across a 
patchwork quilt nailed to a stretcher. 
Monogram (1955-59) includes a taxidermic 
Angora goat wearing a rubber tire around its 
middle. These works grew out of the 
incorporation of collage elements into 
Rauschenberg's otherwise abstract Red 
Paintings of 1953-54 and out of his intense 
dialogue with composer John Cage, 
choreographer Merce Cunningham, and fellow 
painter Jasper Johns. They testify to his 
exuberant embrace of all manner of raw 
material — as well as his sensitive dedication 
to the principles of formal composition. 

In Dylaby Rauschenberg begins with a large 
canvas tarp, half of which is attached to the 
wall and the other half left to drape in folds 
reaching the ground. A skateboard, a rusty 
Coca-Cola sign, and other tacked-up 
fragments create a spare, almost classically 
balanced composition. Rauschenberg's 
recurring use of the color red imbues the work 
with a visual narrative, one that climaxes with 
a splotch of red paint outlined with black 
crayon as if for emphasis. The lines of 
dripping red that escape this outline suggest 
a tension between design and artlessness, 
control and chance. Rauschenberg's handling 
of color also sets up a dialogue between the 
artist's painted marks and the work's ready- 
made components. In Dylaby the red, yellow, 



and white lettering of the Coca-Cola sign is 
echoed in two disks — one red, one yellow- 
set next to a large rectangular swatch of white 
paint. (In another nod to the self-conscious 
artistry underlying what at first appears a 
random configuration, a smaller blue disk 
above them invokes the familiar framework of 
the primary colors.) Two round stains in the 
lower center of the tarp echo the shapes of the 
red and yellow disks, so that one system of 
mimicry and repetition doubles another. Yet 
despite these precise compositional devices, 
Dylaby has a spontaneous, almost slapdash 
feel. Its striking heterogeneity is indeed the 
work's defining feature. 

Dylaby is one component from a larger 
installation Rauschenberg created for an 
exhibition of the same name held in 1962 
at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; its title 
is an amalgamation of the two Dutch words 
dynamisch and labyrint. The curators asked 
the artists (Niki de Saint Phalle, Daniel 
Spoerri, and Jean Tinguely, among others), 
to collaborate on a single sculptural 
environment: a labyrinth to walk through. 
This proved too complicated, and each artist 
completed a separate project. For his part, 
Rauschenberg created a streetscape with 
rectangular forms enclosed by wire fences 
that contained assemblages of found objects: 
an airplane wing, seashells, clocks operating 
at different speeds and times, and the signage, 
tarp, and other items from this tableaux. 
Metamorphosed from junkyard relic to poetic 
art object, Dylaby retains something of its 
decrepit origins.— RH

In 1962 Rauschenberg first used commercially 
produced silkscreens to make large-format 
paintings based on his own photographs and 
found media images. These paintings may be 
considered an extension of the transfer 
drawings he executed between 1958 and 1962. 
in which he directly transferred the contents 
of newspapers and magazines, including ads. 
images, maps, and comics, onto sheets of 
paper. Since he could photographically enlarge 
imagery onto the silkscreens. this process 
freed him from the scale restrictions of the 
transfer technique and allowed him to easily 
reuse images in varied contexts As 
Rauschenberg wrote in a text within his 
artwork Autobiography (1968). he "began 
silk screen paintings to escape familiarity 
of objects and collage" that populated 
his Combines. 



Barge, comprised of a single canvas 
measuring more than thirty feet in width, is 
the largest of his silkscreened paintings This 
monumental work in black, white, and gray 
incorporates many of the motifs that 
Rauschenberg used again and again in his 
seventy-nine silkscreen paintings the urban 
environment (water towers on a rooftop), 
athletes and men of action (swimmers, 
football players, and firemen), space 
exploration and flight (a satellite, a rocket, 
radar dishes, mosquitoes, and birds), modes 
of transportation (a truck), and examples from 
art history (Diego Velazquez's Venus and 
Cupid, known as the "Rokeby Venus"). The 
square format of the screens provides a 
gridlike structure for the composition, which 
is further embellished by areas of gestural 
paint application. 

Rauschenberg sought to highlight his process 
by emphasizing the edges of the silkscreens 
and the individual swipes of the squeegee 
used to apply the ink. As in his earlier 
Combines, elements are layered in an 
exploration of depth and perspective On the 
left edge of the canvas, the difference between 
pictorial and photographic illusions of depth is 
illustrated by a clearly rendered isometric box 
floating beneath a rectangle of gestural 
strokes that reinforces the flat picture plane. 
An image of a headlight leads toward a 
mosquito, which guides the viewer into the 
body of the painting, a composition of 
repetitive forms (the pinwheel shape of the 
mosquito is mimicked by the photographer's 
strobe-light shield, the satellite, and the radar 
dishes) and narrative vignettes (the umbrella- 
like strobe-light shield seems to prevent a 
deluge of dripping paint from hitting the 
football players below) — JY

Robert Rauschenberg first explored the new 
medium of silkscreen in black and white (as in 
Barge, p. 109), but by summer 1963 he had 
introduced color. The paintings of that period, 
including Untitled, best demonstrate the ways 
in which the artist exploited the imperfections 
of the silkscreen process, subverting a perfect 
registration by not aligning the screens or 
by not using all of the colors in four-color 
printing (blue, red, yellow, and black). The 
gestural application of pigment in certain 
areas and the addition of found materials 
(a technique reminiscent of his earlier 
Combines), like the metal and plastic objects 
in Untitled, assert the handmade, as opposed 
to mechanical nature of the paintings. The 
silkscreens capture the random and unending 
visual stimulation that one encounters in daily 
life, as well as the unavoidable barrage of 
visual imagery produced by the mass media. 
Rauschenberg also frequently includes 
personal references. In Untitled the dancer 
Merce Cunningham — with whom he has 
collaborated on theater and costume design 
since 1954 and with whose company he had 
toured Europe in summer 1963— is the central 
image, turned to lie on its side. 

The use of recognizable popular imagery and 
the application of a commercial technique led 
critics to identify Rauschenberg with other 
artists working in this idiom, including Andy 
Warhol, who also began to use the silkscreen 



process in his work at about the same time. 
Although Rauschenberg is certainly of great 
significance to Pop art for his use of found 
commercial imagery, repetition of images, and 
his thwarting of distinctions between high and 
low art, his paintings of the 1960s tended to 
be less depersonalized and more metaphoric 
than Pop. 

Rauschenberg was awarded the International 
Grand Prize in Painting at the Venice Biennale 
in 1964 for his exhibition of Combines and 
silkscreen paintings. Thereafter, he destroyed 
the screens used for those works so as to 
clear the slate for his next artistic endeavors. 
He concentrated for the remainder of the 
decade on performance and technology-based 
artworks; some critics have noted that his 
disdain for a fixed point of view and his need 
for simultaneity and materiality were well 
served by performance art. Transfer 
techniques, though, including silkscreening, 
continue to be an important method for 
Rauschenberg to incorporate photographic 
imagery in his works. — JY

James Rosenquist 

b. 1933 



James Rosenquist was born November 29, 
1933. in Grand Forks. North Dakota. He took 
classes at the Minneapolis School of Art in 
1948. Between 1952 and 1954 he learned 
traditional painting techniques from Cameron 
Booth at the University of Minnesota. 
Minneapolis, and worked as a commercial 
painter during the summer. In 1955 he moved 
to New York and enrolled at the Art Students 
League. In New York, he met Robert Indiana. 
Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, and Robert 
Rauschenberg, among others. During this 
period he worked on small-format, abstract 
paintings. From 1957 to 1960 he supported 
himself by painting billboards, becoming 
completely conversant with the techniques of 
enlarging photographic images on a colossal 
scale. He subsequently began to incorporate 
fragmented images from advertising, movies, 
and commercial art into his works. 

Held in 1962 at the Green Gallery, New York, 
his first solo show received much attention 
from the public and the press. Rosenquist 
stirred viewers' awareness of their relation to 
mass media, with works characterized by huge 
scale, hyperrealism. and popular imagery 
painted in either bright colors or muted grays. 
Since 1962 his work has been systematically 
included in exhibitions of Pop art. 

In 1964 he joined the stable of Leo Castelli 
Gallery, New York, and Galerie lleana 
Sonnabend began to show his work in Paris. 
In 1968 the artist produced his first 
"environment paintings," images of enlarged 
fragment? of unrelated everyday objects. The 
artist experimented with sculpture, cinema, 
and lithography in the early 1970s. In 1976 he 
moved to Aripeka. Florida. Shown at the 1978 
Venice Biennale, his painting F-111 (1964-65), 
which covered four walls of a room in the 
international pavilion, depicted historical 
symbols, signs of affluence, and enlarged 



details of military hardware, addressing 
American war propaganda In the late 1970s 
and 1980s Rosenquist made images of women 
juxtaposed with a machine aesthetic in 
dynamic, layered compositions. 

The Whitney Museum of American Art. New 
York, organized Rosenquist's first important 
museum show in 1972. The artist was also 
honored by several comprehensive exhibitions 
in the 1980s. A retrospective of his paintings 
took place in 1991 at the IVAM Centre Julio 
Gonzalez, Valencia. Spain. The University Art 
Museum, California State University. Long 
Beach, mounted a traveling show of his 
complete graphic work in 1993. In March 
1998 the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin 
unveiled The Swimmer in the Econo-mist 
(1997-98). the museum's first site-specific 
commissioned painting. A major retrospective 
of Rosenquist's work, organized by the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. New York. 
is forthcoming in 2003-04. Rosenquist lives 
and works in New York and Aripeka.

Balcony, 1961 

Oil on canvas and Plexiglas, with mirror 

5 feet x 6 feet 1 inch 

Sonnabend Collection 

Balcony, from 1961, is one of James 
Rosenquist's first works to contain materials 
not traditionally found in painting. It features a 
square mirror near the upper right-hand 
corner and a rectangular piece of Plexiglas in 
the center of the image. Starting in 1962-63, 
tin, clear plastic, aluminum, wood, and 
mirrored glass began to appear regularly in 
Rosenquist's almost mural-size paintings. 
These additions are in many ways comparable 
to Jasper Johns's and Robert Rauschenberg's 
experimentation with newsprint, fabric, and 
other materials from daily life. Rosenquist's 
use of recognizable subjects culled from mass 
culture also aligns him with other Pop artists. 
But the vast scale, cinematic feel, and 
distinctly suburban iconography of 
Rosenquist's painting set it stylistically apart 
from the work of his contemporaries. 

In the shellacked curves of a woman's golden 
bouffant hairdo and the debonair flash of a 
man's cufflink — the two motifs that seem 
about to fit together like pieces of a puzzle in 
the center of Balcony— a cliched story of dry 
martinis, manicured lawns, and backyard 
swimming pools seems about to click into 
vivid motion. The flat, anonymous feel of 
Rosenquist's painting technique has an overtly 
commercial look, one that is often attributed 
to his training as a sign painter. But employed 
in massive paintings, this technique endows 
larger-than-life forms with a surreal, three- 
dimensional plasticity. Rosenquist heightens 
this otherworldly effect by using a white-lead 
base mixed with his colors, which gives them 
a filtered, almost Technicolor appearance. 
Finally he fragments and juxtaposes the 



objects in his paintings so that the apparently 
arbitrary combinations seem to follow an 
idiosyncratic, dreamlike logic. 

In Balcony the vacuity of Rosenquist's 
iconography— a panorama of the suburban 
banal — echoes in the void that is signified by 
the mirror in the corner. Depending on one's 
physical position, the mirror may also reflect 
the viewer's gaze, interrupting the act of 
viewing with a reminder of that act itself. For 
inside Rosenquist's massively scaled work are 
shards of an intimate, perhaps clandestine 
encounter, which also inevitably brings to 
mind scenes from movies and television. His 
painting thus suggests that in contemporary 
life the most public and private spaces of 
perception can never be completely separated. 
In Balcony widely recognizable subject matter 
is closely coupled with the private challenge 
of contemplating Rosenquist's vast and cryptic 
image. — RH

PLATE 20 

Coenties Slip Studio. 1 961 
Oil on shaped canvas 
34 x 43 inches 
Collection of the artist 

Painted in the artist's Lower Manhattan studio 
during a winter snowstorm in 1961. Coenties 
Slip Studio is a mise-en-scene of James 
Rosenquist's studio environment that captures 
a particular visual impression yet also conveys 
his observations, emotions, and desires during 
the storm. Fitting together like pieces of a 
puzzle, the foreground motifs of an egg. fork, 
and spoon connote the artist's hunger during 
the storm, while his loneliness and isolation 
are expressed in the fantasy of a "platinum- 
blond" companion rendered as the length of 
hair articulating the right side of the canvas. 
The gray, shadowy background forms suggest 
the snow-covered cars in the streets outside 
the artist's window. Rosenquist's studio is 
reflected in the concave surface of the spoon, 
while the bright-yellow yoke of a fried egg 
brightens the interior on a cold, dark day, as 
the artist put it, "like an orange in a fried-fish 
shop." The interplay between the colorful egg 
and dining utensils superimposed on the 
grisaille background articulates the three 
domains of the painting: the studio interior; 
the snowy, exterior world; and the fantasy 
realm signified by the woman's hair. That the 
motif of the platinum blond was painted on a 
separate piece of shaped canvas, appended to 
the right side of the otherwise traditionally 
shaped rectangular format, heightens the 
sense of disconnection between fantasy and 
real world. 



The painting's small format— about two and 
a half by three feet— reflects its personal, 
intimate nature Coenties Slip Studio directly 
and powerfully asserts Rosenquist's dictum, 
"All my paintings are autobiographical " It 
exemplifies the visually enigmatic narratives 
he was experimenting with in the early 1960s, 
which were also efforts to capture prosaic 
events, thoughts, and actions in abstracted 
compositions of collagelike imagery —SB

The Facet, 1978 

Oil on canvas 

7 feet 6 inches x 8 feet 

Lilja Art Fund Foundation, Basel, 

On deposit to Musee d'Art Moderne et 

d'Art Contemporain, Nice 

The Facet is an example of James 
Rosenquist's remarkable ability to elucidate 
the goals and expectations of American 
consumer society through the material goods 
it so highly values. Rosenquist's tripartite 
composition conflates the expectations of 
partnership and security with commercial 
objects and the concrete world with private 
concerns and emotions. Layered images of 
soapy, unwashed dishes, an overturned car, 
and the touching hands of a couple appear at 
once dissonant and narrative. The overturned 
car is the key to the painting's meaning, as the 
glowing red windows also articulate the ruby 
of an engagement ring— a visual pun that 
connects the literal "facets" of the gem and 
the metaphoric "facets" of the woman's 
traditional role, represented by the dishes 
above, to the man's hand supporting hers. 
Rosenquist's picture seems to articulate, with 
some irony, the conventional opportunities for 
women; in the words of the artist, "The 
promise of an engagement ring is a new car 
and dirty dishes." 1 The work contemplates the 
exchange value of the relationship between 
husband and wife and the promise of that 
partnership. The progression of cropped, 
snapshotlike images stacked one on top of 
another— from couple to car and ring to dirty 
dishes — pits the banality of actual day-to-day 
existence against the flimsy logic of society's 
heightened, often unrealistic, expectations 
for happiness. 



As is often the case with Rosenquist's 
works, meaning is distilled through visual 
synecdoches and symbolism: The hands 
summarize the couple and their partnership; 
dishes represent the quotidian realities of 
domesticity; the automobile signifies 
convenience, material wealth, and security. 
The obvious salaciousness and forwardness 
of each image is eye-catching — proffered in 
the slick manner of advertising— but the 
combination elides all commercial reasoning 
and suggests a more subtle investigation. 
Realized expectations and fulfilled desires 
rise no further than a pile of dirty dishes. 
Seemingly enigmatic, upon further 
contemplation the images in The Facet form a 
cohesive narrative in which disparate objects 
are combined in a resonant commentary. — SB

The Meteor Hits the Swimmer's Pillow. 1997 

Oil on linen, with metal bedsprings 

8 feet x 5 feet 9 inches 

Courtesy Bernard Jacobson Gallery, London 

For much of his career James Rosenquisf's 
work has registered a fascination with space 
and scientific phenomena. Some of his 
paintings document the United States space 
program, and one series addresses the theory 
of relativity and speed of light. And in a group 
of four works that includes The Meteor Hits 
the Swimmer's Pillow, Rosenquist utilizes a 
memory of a meteor falling to earth. He 
recollects that during his childhood, in 1938, a 
meteor crashed through the roof of a neighbor 
woman's house in Minnesota, injuring her hip 
as she was lying in bed. In The Meteor Hits 
Brancusi's Pillow (1997-99) Rosenquist 
parlays the memory into the canon of art 
history. Before striking the artist's pillow, the 
meteor mingles with Brancusi's sculptures. In 
The Meteor Hits Picasso's Bed (1996-99) it 
hovers larger than life, fixed in the background 
like a massive glowing peril, and in The 
Meteor Hits Monet's Garden (1999). it falls 
out of the sky into a peaceful oasis. 

First referenced in Rosenquist's three-painting 
suite The Swimmer in the Econo-mist 
(1997-98), the "Swimmer" is a symbolic 
reference to the artist. As Rosenquist 
explained, "There's an old Venetian saying, 
'The artist swims in the water, the critic stands 
ashore.' So the swimmer is the active party. 
And the economy is a dream." In The Meteor 
Hits the Swimmer's Pillow, the celestial rock 
hurtles into the pillow situated on a bed that is 
accented by real metal bedsprings attached to 
the surface of the canvas. The bright pink bed 
frame is situated against a dynamic vortex of 
color and fragmented, brand-name detergent 
logos. Rosenquist did not employ the meteor 



in these works as an obvious metaphor for 
the source of creative inspiration for the 
referenced artists, but rather as a meditation 
on day-to-day questions of existence and the 
unexpected events that drastically change the 
course of one's life Rosenquist emphasizes 
that life's unexpected events are perfectly 
democratic, discriminating neither the rich nor 
serving the purposes of the vox populi: "Good 
old mother nature doesn't qualify "— SB

Andy Warho 

1928-1987 



Andy Warhol was born Andrew Warhola on 
August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh. He received 
his B.F.A. from the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, Pittsburgh, in 1949. That same 
year he came to New York, where he soon 
became successful as a commercial artist and 
illustrator. During the 1950s Warhol's 
drawings were published in Glamour and other 
magazines and displayed in department stores; 
he became known for his illustrations of 
I. Miller shoes. In 1952 the Hugo Gallery in 
New York presented a show of Warhol's 
illustrations for stories by Truman Capote. 
Warhol traveled in Europe and Asia in 1956. 

By the early 1960s Warhol began to paint 
comic-strip characters and images derived 
from advertisements; this work was 
characterized by the repetition of images of 
common subjects such as Coca-Cola bottles 
and Campbell's Soup cans. Warhol's 
silkscreened "commodities" were exhibited for 
the first time in 1962, initially at the Ferus 
Gallery, Los Angeles, then in a solo exhibition 
at the Stable Gallery, New York. By 1963 he 
had substituted the silkscreen process for 
hand painting. Working with assistants, he 
produced series of disaster scenes, flowers, 
and celebrity portraits, as well as three- 
dimensional facsimile Brillo boxes and cartons 
of other well-known household products. 

Starting in the mid-1960s at The Factory, his 
New York studio, Warhol concentrated on 
making films that were marked by repetition 
and an emphasis on boredom. In the 1970s 
he produced monumental portraits of Mao 
Tse-tung, commissioned portraits, and the 
Hammer and Sickle series (1977). Warhol also 
became interested in writing: with his staff at 
The Factory, he began to publish Interview 
magazine in 1969, and his The Philosophy of 
Andy Warhol (from A to B and Back Again) 
was published in 1975. A major retrospective 



of Warhol's work organized by the Pasadena 
Art Museum in 1970 traveled in the United 
States and abroad. In 1989 the Museum of 
Modern Art, New York, mounted another 
important retrospective. Inaugurated in 1994, 
the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh 
continuously exhibits paintings, sculpture, and 
films by the artist and houses an important 
collection of related documents, ephemera, 
and source material. Warhol died February 22, 
1987, in New York.

Flowers. 1964 
Silkscreened ink on canvas

In 1964, Andy Warhol had his first exhibition 
at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York and 
presented his new series Flowers. Showing 
with Castelli had been a goal of his for some 
time. By this year, Warhol had already made a 
name for himself with his Campbell's Soup 
cans, disaster pictures, and celebrity portraits, 
and his status in the avant-garde was secure. 
In reviewing the Castelli show. David Bourdon 
described the Flowers as "cutout gouaches by 
Matisse set adrift on Monet's lily pond." Not 
all critics would have agreed with such lofty 
high-art analogies: Warhol himself likened the 
Flowers to "cheap awnings," 2 and this 
reference to a mass-produced product is not 
so far from the reality of their making. Using 
silkscreens to apply ink to canvas (already his 
preferred method for several years), Warhol 
had taken the industrial implications of that 
commercial technique to a logical extreme by 
turning his studio into an assembly line of 
sorts. The Factory, as his loft on Forty-seventh 
Street was known, was the artist's studio as 
well as a social scene, and Warhol enlisted 
friends and assistants to help churn out 
silkscreen works en masse, including the 
many Flowers paintings. 

While the same image is used repeatedly in 
all the Flowers canvases (Warhol found the 
original ir. a women's magazine; it had won 
second prize in a snapshot contest), each 
differs in color, size, or orientation. Some are 
as large as nine feet square, and others 
measure only five by five inches. Works of 
varied dimensions were meant to be installed 
together in a single space in order to create 
the sense that one is looking at wallpaper or 



a film. He would fully articulate this impulse 
soon after in his Cow wallpaper, which 
covered the walls of Castelh's gallery in 1966. 
and in the countless hours of his many films 
After a large group of Flowers was shown in 
1965 at lleana Sonnabend's gallery in Pans. 
Warhol declared that he would devote himself 
to film and no longer make paintings This 
retirement announcement immediately proved 
to be premature and a bit disingenuous, as his 
Factory did not cease painting production or 
concentrate solely on filmmaking, though 
Warhol was quite occupied with that medium 
for the next several years —MD

Early Colored Liz (Turquoise), 1963 
Silkscreened ink on canvas

Elizabeth Taylor's demure gaze stares out from 
Andy Warhol's two silkscreen paintings from 
1963: Early Colored Liz (Chartreuse) and Early 
Colored Liz (Turquoise). If intimations of 
mortality seem to have seeped into the stagy 
lifelessness of Taylor's lipsticked grin, it is not 
accidental. Warhol began painting Taylor when 
she was critically ill, just as he first painted 
Marilyn Monroe after her suicide and Jackie 
Kennedy after her husband's assassination. It 
would seem that in Warhol's pantheon, beauty 
must be magnificently doomed. While he 
would make silkscreens that contained 
multiple images of these iconic women, in 
1963-64 Warhol made close-up "portraits" 
that isolated their individual faces against 
brightly colored backgrounds, adding color 
to their eyes and lips like a makeup artist. 

Warhol depicted Taylor many times, often 
alluding to the romantic or tragic episodes in 
her dramatic life. In a 1962 silkscreen he used 
a photograph of Taylor accompanied by two of 
the famous men in her life — husband Mike 
Todd and Eddie Fisher — along with Fisher's 
then-wife Debbie Reynolds, who was 
notoriously ousted by Taylor after Todd's death 
in a plane crash in 1958. Warhol depicted 
Taylor in many guises: as an innocent eleven- 
year-old in National Velvet, as a gorgeous star 
in studio publicity stills, and in elaborate 



costume for Cleopatra, the very expensive 
box-office failure for which Taylor received an 
unprecedented one million dollars. That 
viewers would already know well the many 
public scandals Taylor courted and endured 
motivated Warhol's selection of her 
as the perfect, ready-made, tragically 
glamorous subject. 

The tension between an implied yet 
unknowable interior and a masklike public 
persona marks all of Warhol's celebrity 
portraits, begun — along with his use of the 
photo-silkscreen, originally a commercial 
technique — in 1962. Revealing the original 
newsprint image as an enlarged map of tiny 
dots, silkscreen functions as a photograph 
of a photograph, registering the artificiality 
of the original image in its new incarnation. 
Transformed by closely cropped compositions 
and bright washes of color, Warhol's 
silkscreens vividly illustrate both sides of 
America's fascination with celebrity: its vision 
of the star is simultaneously sentimental and 
garish, sensual and wholesome, intimate 
and untouchable.— RH

Andy Warhol announced his disengagement 
from the process of aesthetic creation in 1963: 
"I think somebody should be able to do all my 
paintings for me," he told art critic Gene 
Swenson.' The Abstract Expressionists had 
seen the artist as a heroic figure, alone 
capable of imparting his poetic vision of the 
world through gestural abstraction. Warhol, 
like other Pop artists, used found printed 
images from newspapers, publicity stills, and 
advertisements as his subject matter; he 
adopted silkscreening, a technique of mass 
reproduction, as his medium. And. unlike the 
Abstract Expressionists, who searched for a 
spiritual pinnacle in their art, Warhol aligned 
himself with the signs of contemporary mass 
culture. His embrace of subjects traditionally 
considered debased — from celebrity worship 
to food labels— has been interpreted both as 
an exuberant affirmation of American culture 
and as a thoughtless espousal of the "low." 
The artist's perpetual examination of themes 
of death and disaster suggests yet another 
dimension to his art. 

Warhol was preoccupied with news reports of 
violent death— suicides, car crashes, 
assassinations, and executions. In the early 
1960s ho began to make paintings, such as 
Orange Disaster f5, with the serial application 
of images revolving around the theme of 
death. "When you see a gruesome picture over 
and over again," he commented, "it doesn't 
really have any effect ." Yet Orange Disaster *b. 
with its electric chair repeated fifteen times, 
belies this statement Warhol's painting speaks 



to the constant reiteration of tragedy in the 
media, and becomes, perhaps, an attempt to 
exorcise this image of death through 
repetition. However, it also emphasizes the 
pathos of the empty chair waiting for its next 
victim, the jarring orange only accentuating 
the horror of the isolated seat in a room with 
a sign blaring SILENCE. 

Warhol's death and disaster pictures 
underscore the importance of the vanitas 
theme — that death will take us all— in his 
oeuvre. His vanitas imagery has a particularly 
American cast: he recorded American 
disasters, the consumption of American 
products (including movie stars), and. as 
art historian Sidra Stich has pointed out. 
American modes of death, such as execution 
by electrocution — JB

PLATE 23 

Four Colored Campbell's Soup Cans, 1965 
Acrylic and silkscreened ink on four 
framed canvases 
36 1 /4 x 24 inches each 
Sonnabend Collection 

Warhol first exhibited a series of thirty-two 
paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans in 
1962 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. 
Gallerist Irving Blum installed them on a shelf 
mounted to the wall, stressing a gallery-as- 
supermarket correlation that caused some 
initial hostile response. A neighboring gallery, 
for example, placed rows of the actual soup 
cans in their window in protest, selling them 
for the market value of twenty-nine cents. 

By 1965, the year that these Four Colored 
Campbell's Soup Cans were produced, 
Warhol, who had enjoyed success as a 
commercial artist in New York in the 1950s, 
was well established in the art world and was 
employing assistants to help in the production 
of his work in his studio, The Factory. In his 
now famous exhibition at New York's Stable 
Gallery in 1964, visitors made their way past 
stacks of piled up wooden boxes that he had 
had silkscreened on all sides to look like boxes 
of Brillo pads, Mott's Apple Juice, and Heinz 
Tomato Ketchup. "Shoppers" walked among 
the aisles of piled-up "products" as if in a 
crowded warehouse and could carry away 
their purchases in clear plastic bags. While 
re-creating actual consumer items and selling 
them as art represented a step beyond the 
depiction of soup-can labels in his paintings, 
Warhol later returned to the motif, which in 
essence became a kind of brand or logo for 
the artist himself and his practice in general. 



The first Soup Cans incorporated a 
combination of processes, including hand 
painting, but the replication of the labels soon 
came to be streamlined, using just a 
silkscreen technique. Four Colored Campbell's 
Soup Cans shows more complex layering and 
repetition as well as the brighter colors that 
characterize Warhol's later work in this 
medium. The removal of traces of the artist's 
hand and the assembly-line nature of his 
production suggest the artist as a machine, 
which was a preoccupation of Warhol's at the 
time. "The reason I am painting this way," 
he famously said, "is that I want to be a 
machine, and I feel that whatever I do and do 
machinelike is what I want to do." 

Warhol's strategy of appropriation and his use 
of common middle-class commodities 
followed a tradition already present in Modern 
art (from Marcel Duchamp's readymades, for 
example, to Jasper Johns's sculpture of the 
late 1950s). But his serial replication of 
images further questioned the idea of the work 
of art as the unique expression of an 
individual, and his use of the most ordinary, 
readily available consumer products can be 
seen as a critique of the banality and 
anonymity of modern life. — LMcM

One Hundred and Fifty Multicolored Marilyns

Acrylic and silkscreen enamel on canvas 

6 feet 6 inches x 34 feet 6 inches 

Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 

1997.19 

The late 1970s and early 1980s signaled an 
elaboration of Andy Warhol's visual language, 
where he revisited some themes and 
developed new ones. Stylistically his work 
evolved into more intricate painterly virtuosity 
and included new kinds of spatial layering, 
forceful hues, and overlapping images, which 
infinitely complicated the repetition of his 
earlier silkscreens. A mood of personal and 
public retrospection pervades many of these 
late works. 

The image of Marilyn Monroe first appeared in 
Warhol's work in 1962, the year of Monroe's 
death. In Gold Marilyn, an image of the star's 
face is set against a gold background to 
deliberately emulate the quality of a religious 
icon. In 1962 alone Warhol made numerous 
silkscreens using the same iconic photo 
reproduction of Monroe, with her lips parted 
and eyes seductive and heavy-lidded, in 
different configurations: two Marilyns, four, 
six. then twenty-five, a tondo, and a diptych. 
The quantity of repetition in One Hundred and 
Fifty Multicolored Marilyns expresses most 
clearly the potentially unlimited replication of 
this— or any— image 

During the 1970s Warhol created portraits of 
friends such as Liza Minnelli and Mick Jagger, 
as well as a series devoted to Chinese leader 



Mao Tse-tung, and began publishing Interview 
in 1969. a magazine devoted initially to film 
and ultimately to covering entertainers, the 
fashionable, and the famous One Hundred 
and Fifty Multicolored Marilyns is part of a 
continuum of Warhol's well-documented 
obsession with fame, but it is also a nostalgic 
return to his first celebrity subject In fact, this 
work is one of two unusually large and wide 
paintings of 1979 of two extraordinarily 
famous women, Monroe and Mona Lisa (as 
painted by Leonardo da Vinci), both of whom 
were subjects of paintings completed by 
Warhol in the early 1960s. While these faces 
have a traceable history in Warhol's oeuvre. 
they were resurrected by the artist nearly 
twenty years later in a quite startling way. 
Icons of feminine renown, dwelling in 
the world of museum and movie goddesses, 
the faces are now expanded to mural 
dimensions. But the decorative potential of 
these repetitive images is undermined by the 
pervasively haunting quality of memory, in 
part because of the artist's re-creation of the 
image as a photographic negative that 
reverses our sense of solid and void, flesh and 
spirit The colors also effect this sense of a 
ghostly emanation These relics of secular 
divinities function as a register of both public 
memory and the memory of the artist himself 
as he looks back on his own career It is a 
mood of retrospection that characterizes 
Warhol's late work, which includes moody 
self-portraits, a series devoted to skulls, and 
an installation of dramatic shadow paintings

Tom Wesselmann 

b. 1931 



Tom Wesselmann was born February 23, 1931, 
in Cincinnati, Ohio. As a youth, he did not 
intend to pursue a career in the arts. He 
completed his undergraduate studies at the 
University of Cincinnati and received a degree 
in psychology. Wesselmann's college career 
was briefly interrupted when he was drafted 
into the United States Army and sent to Fort 
Riley, Kansas, to study aerial photography for 
strategic interpretation. It was during his 
military service that he started drawing, 
creating humorous cartoons. In 1954 he 
began taking classes at the Art Academy of 
Cincinnati; two years later he moved to New 
York and enrolled at Cooper Union to pursue 
his artistic interests. Wesselmann would soon 
become friends with Jim Dine and Claes 
Oldenburg, influential artists who introduced 
him to the New York avant-garde of the time. 

While attending summer school in 1959, 
Wesselmann began making collages. Attaching 
bits of quotidian detritus to modestly sized 
pieces of composition board, he created 
schematic interiors with figures and still lifes. 
Wesselmann enjoyed the seductive qualities of 
commercial goods, and gradually he moved 
away from abstraction toward materials and 
images culled from advertising and consumer 
culture. His paintings of the early 1960s 
include familiar products and brand-name 
foods like Coca-Cola and Lipton Tea, as well as 
reproductions of works by other artists like 
Henri Matisse and Piet Mondrian, among fruits 
and other more traditional still-life subjects. 
Sometimes Wesselmann would attach actual 
objects to his two-dimensional surfaces in 
order to achieve an added realism; for 
example, a work from 1962 depicting a kitchen 
employs a glowing fluorescent light that can 
be turned on and off, a real faucet, and a 
cupboard that opens to reveal soap pads and 
other household goods. 



Wesselmann would frequently include a female 
nude in his still lifes, and in 1961 he began 
to pursue the theme with some intensity. 
Enamored of, but also frustrated by, Willem de 
Kooning's seminal series of Women paintings 
(1950-55), Wesselmann quickly sensed that 
figuration had gone as far as the prevailing 
artistic tendencies would permit. Distancing 
himself from Abstract Expressionism, 
Wesselmann set out to develop an artistic 
lexicon of his own in his famous Great 
American Nude series. Several of these were 
included in his first solo exhibition at New 
York's Tanager Gallery, organized by artist Alex 
Katz in 1961. 

In 1962 Wesselmann was included in the 
International Exhibition of the New Realists 
at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York, a 
prophetic survey of early Pop art from Europe 
and the United States. He went on to have solo 
shows in New York at the Green Gallery in 
1962-65, and at Sidney Janis, where he would 
exhibit his work into the 1990s. 

In the early 1980s Wesselmann's aesthetic 
took on a more reductive quality, and he began 
using laser technology to make simplified steel 
and aluminum cutouts of his nudes and still 
lifes. From his early collages to these more 
recent pieces, the objects are always rendered 
within a tangible, pictorial space that refers 
back to traditional still-life, landscape, and 
figurative painting. Wesselmann's art has been 
the subject of numerous retrospectives in 
galleries and museums throughout Europe, 
Japan, and the United States. He maintains 
a studio in New York.

Tom Wesselmann's Still Life #45. a mixed- 
medium work from 1962. first strikes the 
viewer with a powerfully iconic image, then 
gradually reveals shades of complex artistic 
experimentation. A glistening, roasted turkey 
is placed front and center, taking up almost 
the entire picture plane. It is set against a 
polychrome background composed of four 
Kodachrome hues— red, orange, yellow, and 
blue— painted in broad, horizontal stripes 
across the entire width of the canvas. From 
the work's left edge peek three cutout roses, 
painted on a piece of board with the freehand 
loops of a practiced commercial style. The use 
of a collage technique in Wesselmann's work 
is unmistakable. The turkey — a vacuum- 
formed plastic supermarket display— projects 
forcefully into the viewer's space, while the 
roses create actual shadows on the picture's 
surface. The initial effect resembles that of a 
photographer's preparatory staging — a dress 
rehearsal for a "real" painting, complete with 
color chart and proxy bouquet. But the lasting 
impression is of an artist profoundly invested 
in the formal issues of painting: composition, 
figure-ground relationships, and color. 

Wesselmann's two best-known groups of 
work— the Still Life series, from 1962-64. 
and the Great American Nude series, begun 
in 1961— betray the idiosyncratic approach 
underlying his fascination with painting. His 
use of instantly recognizable subject matter 
and his cool pseudo-realist visual style link 



Wesselmann to such Pop artists as Roy 
Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist In fact, 
Wesselmann's work is also profoundly 
indebted to the painterly innovations of 
Abstract Expressionists like Willem de 
Kooning, an artist he particularly admired. 
Wesselmann's Still Life '45. for example 
its strong central motif balanced against an 
allover ground, echoes, with a decade's ironic 
distance, de Kooning's mid-1950s Women 
series — RH

In the early 1960s artists began to approach 
the canvas not just as a flat surface to be 
painted, but as something potentially 
sculptural by adding three-dimensional 
elements to the two-dimensional surface. 
For example, Robert Rauschenberg sometimes 
included working mechanical devices in his 
Combines, bringing the assemblage technique 
into the realm of functional capability; 
embedded in one such work, Broadcast 
(1959), is a homemade sound system, 
complete with adjustable knobs, that emits 
the white noise of radio static. It may have 
been the innovations of Rauschenberg as well 
as those of Jasper Johns in the late 1950s 
that initially broke new formal and aesthetic 
ground, but other artists, including Tom 
Wesselmann, pursued such two- and three- 
dimensional combinations in their own 
manner. Wesselmann's use of appliances 
such as telephones, radios, television sets, 
and clocks remained faithful to and indeed 
further articulated one's expectations of a 
product-filled American household despite 
his sometimes uncanny juxtaposition of the 
pictorial and the three dimensional. 

Wesselmann's Still Life #21 is one of his 
more discreet combinations of the mechanical 
and the handmade. This tabletop arrangement 
of groceries and produce is interrupted by a 
human hand dispensing soda into a glass, 
a frozen gesture that is underscored by a 
soundtrack of the fizzy liquid pouring from the 
bottle (a tape recorder playing a continuous 
loop of the sound is affixed to the back of the 
work). Although the hand pouring the 



beverage is that of a man, male figures rarely 
make a direct appearance in Wesselmann's 
genre scenes. Rather, the masculine presence 
is generally understood to be provided by the 
viewer/consumer of his works, who functions 
as the anticipated character returning after a 
long day's work to receive the many pleasures 
of home. The implications of such an 
exclusively male viewership would become 
unavoidable in Wesselmann's ironic and 
confrontational Great American Nude series 
(begun in 1961), in which blatantly erotic 
female figures are posed in interiors among 
still-life objects— AM

Still Life #34 exemplities Tom Wesselmann's 
tacility at restaging the classical still life as an 
exploration ot convenience and indulgence in 
American society of the 1960s. He knowingly 
references and subverts high-art tropes; 
the tondo-shaped canvas, a form typical in 
Renaissance portraiture and depictions of 
religious themes, is here used to frame a 
seemingly random selection of consumer 
goods, thus fusing Robert Rauschenberg's 
proverbial gap between art and life. The typical 
contents of a seventeenth-century Dutch still 
life — crystal wine carafe; cornucopia of fruits, 
nuts, and other delicacies; and freshly-killed 
game brought in from the hunt— are here 
updated to a late twentieth-century suburban 
home; the modern merchant class now 
imbibes in Coca-Cola, strawberry milk shakes, 
and an after-dinner cigarette. 

Still Life #34 posits itself as a metaphor 
for a prosperous society that supports the 
universality of everyday luxuries. The 
American postwar aesthetic of commercialism 
and commodification, with its attitude of 
"more is better," is the vision put forth in 
Wesselmann's Still Life series. As in other 
pictures from the series, the individual 
components of Still Life *34 are rendered in a 
combination of hand-painted areas and printed 
reproductions collaged to the surface. The 
visible brushstrokes that comprise the 
tabletop, azure vase, and obscure logolike 
shape evidence the painter's hand, heightening 
the more linear soda bottle and hyperreal 



shells of the Diamond walnuts The red. blue, 
and yellow form is an unusual visual code that 
Wesselmann includes in several other works 
(e.g.. Still Life *33, p 126). Sometimes this 
oval shape denotes the back of an Art Deco 
chair that the artist owned and frequently used 
as a prop, but more often it appears as an 
abstract, nonspecific logo form free of any 
corporate or brand name —AM

After relocating to a more accommodating 
studio in 1963, Tom Wesselmann began 
working on a larger scale, creating 
monumental canvases such as Still Life #33. 
The source material he used in the early 1960s 
gradually evolved from magazine cutouts to 
bigger preexisting ads taken directly from 
subway stations and window displays, as well 
as enormous billboard advertisements. The 
billboard aesthetic informs Still Life #33, 
which despite its grand scale is meant to be 
read as a group of objects arranged on a 
tabletop. Wesselmann's strategy of grouping 
items and products related only by their 
consumable nature in a nonhierarchical 
arrangement focuses attention on the entire 
whole rather than the individual elements of 
the work. The shallow foreground practically 
subsumes the spectator into the composition. 

Still Life #33 might be described as an 
exaggerated display of a veritable 
workingman's diet. A gleaming portion of 
submarine sandwich dominates the frontal 
plane, in contrast to its counterparts, which 
conform to the strong verticality of the rest of 
the composition. The sandwich is cut off at 
the edge of the canvas, suggesting that we are 
seeing only part of this potentially endless 
bounty. Towering behind the sandwich, a 
colossal can of Budweiser and a pack of Pall 
Mall cigarettes stand firmly if somewhat 
ironically as monuments to consumerism. 
Nestled between them is the top of an orange, 
which echoes the curve of a woman's breast 
and may allude to Wesselmann's obsession 



with the female nude in other works. The 
package of cigarettes is much like the real 
advertisements that Wesselmann frequently 
attached to his canvases, but this 
representation was actually hand painted by 
the artist to confound the boundary between 
handmade and machine produced. The roses, 
which seem to hover overhead, are attached to 
the wall, signaling the limits of this interior, 
and the right side of the canvas offers a 
glimpse of the horizon beyond. Hand-painted 
bars of pure color provide firm ground for 
the objects, the vertical white and blue 
stretching under the still life suggesting the 
illusion of depth in the otherwise flat, frontal 
composition. The ostentatious scale of the 
painting reflects Wesselmann's appetite for 
constructing high-keyed domestic landscapes 
that surround the viewer with products and 
rituals that they know intimately —AM
