A major retrospective exhibition of Jean Dubuffet's work had been sought by 
the Guggenheim Museum for a long time. It was first spoken of when I 
proposed it to the artist during his visit to the Guggenheim in October 1966, 
on the occasion of the first American museum survey of his Honrloupe series. 
Upon Dubuffet's acceptance, the Centre National d'Art Contemporain in 
Paris announced its eagerness to present Dubuffet's work, also in extensive 
scope, at the Grand Palais, to fall within a series of grand homages accorded 
to French masters of the twentieth century. Discussions, therefore, were 
initiated with Blaise Gautier, the Centre National d'Art Contemporain's 
director, which resulted in an agreement to unite our respective efforts in a 
common cause and to present essentially the same exhibition in New York 
and in Paris. Fruitful and mutually gratifying cooperation between the 
two museum organizations ensued in the intervening years. 

A retrospective of such magnitude cannot be attempted without the 
agreement of key lenders to support the exhibition project. The artist himself 
and major collectors of his work were initially committed and eventually 
joined by many others, to whom both organizing institutions are deeply and 
sincerely grateful. The sacrifices made by individuals willing to deprive 
themselves for an extended period of time of cherished objects, and the 
readiness of many museums to entrust their possessions to our care may be 
justified only by one consideration: to show a meaningful sequence selected 
from the life-work of a great contemporary artist in two metropolitan 
centers of art. This catalogue, also produced in cooperation with our Parisian 
colleagues, reflects such a choice by listing a total of 296 works, all destined 
to fill the spaces of the Guggenheim and (with some inevitable substitu- 
tions) those of the Grand Palais. 

The large and responsible task of selection and the organization of the 
catalogue has been entrusted to Margit Rowell who, throughout the project, 
acted as the exhibition's curator. In the course of her search, no effort 
was spared to present Dubuffet's creative evolution through a carefully 
considered chronological sequence and to render it meaningful through 
the finest examples obtainable. 

The usual framework of such a project (with its double dimension of 
exhibition and catalogue) has, in this case, been extended through the 
addition of a performance, also rooted in Jean Dubuffet's art. The event, 
entitled Coucou Bazar, is, in fact, subject to a double reading: as kinetic 



extension of the show itself, or as a performing-arts parallel of it. It was 
staged by Brooke Lappin and his colleagues in close cooperation with, 
indeed upon instruction by, Jean Dubuffet himself. 

Organization and selection of this retrospective, publication of the catalogue 
and production of Coucou Bazar, the financing of the undertaking, and the 
final presentation of all parts, has proven to be a task as taxing as it has 
been rewarding for those involved in it. Many individuals, within and outside 
of this museum made valuable contributions. They are too numerous to 
be thanked individually and will, I trust, accept the collective thanks offered 
them most sincerely herewith. Even in a summary acknowledgement, 
however, we cannot avoid naming the loyal members of Dubuffet's 
Secretariat, Mrs. Armande de Trentinian and Miss Pascale Flavigny for 
their unflagging efforts on our behalf. We are also grateful to Pierre de 
Montbas for his assistance on this project, as well as to Arnold Glimcher 
of the Pace Gallery for his generous and enthusiastic cooperation. 

Last, our joint and deep gratitude goes to Jean Dubuffet who has honored 
our initiative with his interest and his sympathy and who, in behalf of all 
of us, has not hesitated to assume burdens that went far beyond any 
reasonable expectation. 



Introduction 

Thomas M. Messer 



Jean Dubuffet's sharp profile began to delineate itself in the middle of the 
nineteen-forties against the pale background of the postwar School of Paris. 
His final emergence, after a number of false starts, was timely, and his rude 
disturbance of efforts to continue the great modern traditions in diluted 
form evoked anguished outcries from the world of institutionalized culture. 
It was then that Dubuffet's iconoclastic identity was established through the 
provocative projection of his brute images, his artless techniques and his 
relentless anticultural stance. Thirty years later, Dubuffet remains a harsh 
opponent of cultural pretension and a fervent partisan of original, indigenous 
expression. During these three decades, however, the artist has undertaken 
an investigation of formal possibilities which, in scope and thoroughness, 
is probably without equal in our time. The Dubuffet of the seventies, there- 
fore, cannot be seen solely through preconceptions deriving from his work of 
the forties. Even then, the earthy, passionate and creatively destructive 
image, which he projected so powerfully, was balanced by a less visible but 
nonetheless insistent alter ego that strove, on its own terms, for order and 
authority. Through encompassing both the Dionysian and the Apollonian, 
Dubuffet exemplifies the paradox without which his art eludes us. This 
paradox is based upon awareness of the fundamental cohesion between 
polarities and a capacity to reach out for the grand embrace that brings 
contraries into a tense, oscillating harmony. 

Dubuffet had already come to clear conclusions about the nature of art 
in his gestative period. It was obvious to him that art differed from what it 
was often thought to be, and that neither the mimetic figurations demanded 
by an untaught public nor the abstract essences dear to the culturally 
affected were worth his time or his effort. Art, in contrast, was the place 
where ultimate issues hung in the balance. To reach and rejoin that place, 
Dubuffet opted for the direct and potent language of materials. He knew 
that their mysterious power to become carriers of thought was based upon 
their participation in the shaping and forming processes and, therefore, 
invited them into a threefold partnership with himself and his subject matter. 
Materials (matiere) assumed a key position during the forties and fifties, when 
the artist's efforts were bent upon the destruction of the false gods of culture. 

Dubuffet's obsessive preoccupation with matiere and his eventual 

return to form is the central theme of Max Loreau's recent book 

Jean Dubuffet: Delits, deportements, lieitx de bant jeu. Dubuffet's chronicler 

sees the years of intensive matiere exploration not only in terms of the 



artist's primary reliance upon his means, but as an effort to raise matiere 
from its classic subservience to a level of equality with form and even of 
dominance over it. Matiere, described by Loreau as the despised component 
of an art-view dominated by non-material thought, must be brought to 
assert its superior reality-substance in a struggle with the form complement 
that, by itself, is doomed to a thin and sterile ideated existence. As the 
argument develops, form is equated with culture (in Dubuffet's pejorative 
sense) while matiere becomes the carrier of an anticultural position — the 
concrete parallel to creation itself. The phases of Dubuffet's evolution, after 
the abandonment of the still pictorial Marionnettes, first set the stage for a 
matiere/torm confrontation and then carried it through to its ultimate 
consequence. The various departures are well known and reappear here 
as the subject of the current retrospective which presents Dubuffet's work 
in unprecedented fullness. His portraits, the grotesque landscapes, the fierce 
images of the Corps de dames, various modes of assemblage, his concern 
with texture and many other phases may be read, even though not 
deliberately intended, as assaults of the matiere component against form; 
and by extension, as the advance of creation against culture. The final 
chapter in the elevation of matiere to the detriment of form, is devoted to the 
materiologies, "a veritable desert of form destruction," a phase seemingly 
foreclosing continuation by its finality. In the context proposed by Loreau, 
the Hoitrloupe redresses the balance and provides a formula for continuity 
by clothing form in a self-mocking figuration, and by locking it in an 
unbreakable embrace with the opposing matiere ingredient. The latter, in 
turn, is reduced to its original, clandestine role. Paradoxically, this precarious 
artifice has attained great solidity. For the artist, it secured a measure of 
detachment as he delegated to the rearranged components the 
self-perpetuating life of the work of art. 

The Hoitrloupe appears first as a subconscious ball-point doodle, 
translates itself into painting, reliefs, sculpture, architectural environments 
and, eventually, into a still nameless theatrical idiom. It is based on a 
contrived system of planes and stripes carried out in red and blue on 
black or white and, in its three-dimensional realization, through materials 
(styrofoam) that suggest an ephemeral, labile unreality. The new, condi- 
tional accommodation with form, as Loreau points out, is achieved through 
false means that are charged with the attainment of virtual ends. 



The importance of the proposed theses lies in the conception of Dubuffet's 
evolution in terms of a continuous entity; it implicitly rejects a contem- 
plation of the artist's work in two separate parts. A unified view of 
Dubuffet's work may also be attained by accepting the Hourloupe style as a 
reenactment of earlier material phases. Dubuffet's tendency to elaborate, 
through Hourloupe devices, images conceived and expressed earlier, suggests 
that it is the point of reference more than the content in his art that had 
undergone a basic transformation. In Dubuffet, as in Goethe's Faust, 
part I is world exploration — a search for knowledge about man on a 
profound level of existence. Parts II, in Faust as well as in Dubuffet, 
transfer this search from the familiar world-frame to an unknown, 
virtual plane where analogous subject matter relives a now transcended 
existence. In these spheres, the passionate and earthy, the material dimension 
of the human condition, are supplanted by a parallel of wider scope and 
of greater symbolic reach. The Hourloupe, if only by implication, continues 
to explore the human predicament; but the context has shifted with the 
transferral onto an inhuman landscape, far removed from the phenomena 
of nature which Dubuffet came to know so well and had explored so deeply. 

This Retrospective will show that Dubuffet's life-work is of one piece. 
Diversity, inconsistency, even Dubuffet's propensity for "error," do not 
reduce but strengthen the total significance of his central contribution. 
Today Dubuffet stands before us as a force which, despite itself, has entered 
and determined the mainstream of a reformed cultural outlook.

Jean Dubuffet: 

An Art on the Margins 

of Culture 

Margit Rowell 



1. Jean Dubuffet, Prospectus et tons 
ecrits suivants, compiled and edited 
by Hubert Damisch, Editions Galli- 
mard, Paris, 1967, 2 volumes, vol. II, 
p. 61. All translations from the French 
are by the author. Hereafter referred 
to as Prospectus. 



Over the span of his thirty-year career, Jean Dubuffet has refused to be 
recupcre par la culture or co-opted by the culture which in 1943 he set out 
to undermine. Although the major museum retrospectives planned this 
year in New York and Paris imply popular and official approval, evidence of 
continuing resistance to his activity proves this implication false. It seems 
more accurate to suggest that since there is no place for cultural phenomena 
outside of culture, Dubuffet has been integrated by default into cultural 
history: his name and myth have been generally accepted in a resigned 
gesture to the inevitable. He remains nonetheless a thorn in twentieth- 
century culture's side. 

By any standards Dubuffet's work is not "beautiful." It defies the term 
"interesting." The subject matter is mundane. The visual formulation runs 
counter to the accepted notions — no matter how elusive — of the work of art 
in our time. Considered negatively by the viewer, these are positive values 
in the eyes of the artist, who stated as early as 1945: 

Personally 1 am not interested in what is exceptional and this extends to 
all domains. I feed on the banal. The more banal a thing may be, the better 
it suits me. Luckily I do not consider myself exceptional in any way. In my 
paintings, I wish to recover the vision of an average and ordinary man, 
and, it is without using techniques beyond the grasp of an ordinary man 
. . . that I have tried to constitute great celebrations. Celebrations (or feasts) 
are much more highly prized when, instead of setting themselves apart on 
foreign soil . . . they occur in our everyday life. It is then that their virtue 
(to transform our daily life into a marvellous feast) is effective. I am 
speaking of celebrations of the mind; please may it be understood: cele- 
brations of humors and deliriums. Art addresses itself to the mind, not 
to the eyes. Too many people think that art addresses itself to the eyes. 
That is to make of it poor use. 

Similarly, the most simple and common spectacles appeal to me the 
most . . . . I am a tourist of a very special kind: what is picturesque disturbs 
me. It is where the picturesque is absent that I am in a state 
of constant amazement. 1 

Dubuffet was born into a bourgeois family of wine merchants in Le Havre 
in 1901. He attended the Lycee of Le Havre until 1918 when he received his 
Baccalaureate degree. The following is the artist's account of his background 
and his reasons for rejecting it: 



15 



After the Lycee, I studied painting for six or seven years as well as many 
other subjects: poetry, literature, avant-garde, arriere-garde, metaphysics, 
paleography, ethnography, foreign languages, ancient languages; as you 
can see I was looking for the Way. Well, it didn't work out; I had the 
impression that I was not adapted to my human condition; I was slipping 
around; the gears would not lock into place. After all these years of 
(half-baked) studies, this accumulation of knowledge (which 1 forgot as 
I went along) and systems (which I was constantly changing), in the back 
of my mind I had this feeling of anxiety that all of it was not worth much 
. . . in the final analysis, I had missed the boat. . . . When I went to the barber 
shop in Chaville and observed the men talking to each other, when 1 
listened to the local fireman talking to the butcher or the postman, I felt 
that they seemed very adapted, so much more adapted than myself. Their 
accents of joy and certainty made me envious and the idea came to me 
that in their disjointed conversation there was more sap, more of the 
unexpected, more invention, in a word more flavor. Let's use the word: 
there was more art — yes, more art and poetry in the words of the barber 

— in his life — in his head — than in those of the so-called specialist 

And those guys ivere beating me at my own game . . . 

In the streetcar, Dubuffet continued to observe the people around him: 

/ look at the man sitting opposite me. Tranquil, peaceful face. No prob- 
lems. Delighted to be alive. Happy to have a seat on the streetcar and to 
have new shoes. The conductor jokes with him. He answers without 
thinking, in exactly the right tone. Ah, that cannot be imitated, that tone. 
The woman next to him, tranquil. Nice intelligent and laughing face. 
Happy to have earrings, her man out of the hospital, he has a raise. Such 
faces, full of picturesqueness and personality, full of animation and at the 
same time profundity, complexity, humanism. In the end I couldn't stand 
it any longer: I lay down my brushes and I went to work in a wine-shop 
and subsequently became a wine-dealer . . . 2 

The preceding passages acknowledge a peculiar sense of reality which was 
to serve as the basis for Dubuffet's mature expression. Significantly, he was 
not born to the commonplace but adopted it from an outsider's point of view. 
In 1942, when he left the wine business to take up painting full-time, 
Dubuffet was neither an untrained artist nor a man without artistic culture. 
He had attended art school from 1916 to 1920. He had studied art history. 
In the 192.0's in Paris he had been friendly with Max Jacob and members

. Dubuft'et intended to write a treatise 
on the development of artists' motifs 
throughout history. The treatise was 
not written, but the experience pro- 
vided him with an invaluable repertory 
of "cultural" motifs to be avoided 
when, years later, he adopted his 
anticultural position.

compiling a repertory of visual motifs, their incidence and variations. 3 
Dubuffet's closest friends throughout the forties in Paris were the most 
brilliant and celebrated literary talents of the time. They included Francis 
Ponge, Jean Paulhan, Henri Michaux, Georges Limbour, Raymond Queneau 
and others too numerous to cite. He was also friendly with Jean Fautrier, 
an abstract painter highly esteemed by a small circle of intellectuals. So that 
by 1942, Dubuffet was far from uncontaminated by culture. On the contrary, 
culture was his element. Shedding his acquired ideas would not be easy. 

The single most important event in orienting Dubuffet's activity was his 
discovery of the art of the mentally ill. In 1923, Dubuffet was given a book 
written by Dr. Hans Prinzhorn: Bildnerei der Geisteskranken, published 
in Berlin the preceding year. 4 When it appeared, this book created a sensation 
through its assertions that art works executed by asylum inmates were 
worthy of serious aesthetic consideration. Prinzhorn was also one of the first 
to draw comparisons between these works and the art of children and 
of primitive cultures. 

To Dubuffet, the book was indeed a revelation, and in it one finds the 
catalysts, if not the sources, for many of his artistic premises. Prinzhorn's 
theories echo certain German romantic ideas of the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries. When he speaks of man's natural state as opposed to 
his cultural (denatured) state — man's primal unity with the universe which 
has been annihilated by the artificial conventions and repressions of so-called 
civilization — he evokes Nietzsche and Freud. For Prinzhorn, unfettered basic 
animal and spiritual drives may lead the individual to psychic strength and 
harmony with the universe, instead of to neurosis, which is the more 
common case when he is bound within the confines of Western civilization. 
To Prinzhorn, the art of the mentally ill manifests a universal creative urge, 
an urge which cultural inhibitions generally stifle. 

Dubuffet projected a similar philosophy in his Anticultural Positions 
speech of 195 1. In six points, he expressed his rejection of certain premises 
of occidental culture and his preference for the spiritual attitudes of 
primitive peoples: 

1. Western man believes that he is very different from other elements of 
nature such as the wind, trees and rivers. Conversely, primitive man believes 
that he is of similar substance, that there exists a real continuity between 
man and nature, and that man is not a superior being but merely one 
being among many. 



17 



2. Western man believes that the world exists in the shape that he thinks it, 
based on reason and logic. Primitive man, on the contrary, rejects logic and 
respects the states of delirium and madness. Dubuffet confesses to "a great 
interest in madness. I am convinced that art has much to do with 
madness and aberrations.'" 

3. Occidental culture admires "elaborated ideas." Dubuffet thinks that 
"elaborated ideas" are an impoverished state of the thought process. He is 
interested in "the mental process at a deeper point of its roots where I 

am sure the sap is richer." 

4. Occidental culture is fond of analysis. Dubuffet distrusts analysis. "My 
inclination leads me, when I want to see something really well, to regard it 

with its surroundings, whole If there is a tree in the country, I don't bring 

it into my laboratory to look at it under my microscope. Because I think 

the wind which blows through its leaves is necessary for knowledge of the 
tree and cannot be separated from it " 

5. ". . . our culture is based on an enormous confidence in language — 
especially the written language, and the belief in its ability to translate and 
elaborate thought." Dubuffet prefers the spoken to the written word. 
"Speech is more concrete, animated by the sound of the voice, intonations, 
a cough, even grimaces and mimicry, and it seems to me more effective . . ." 
Painting is more effective still than the written word, particularly painting 
which seeks to capture the underground and primal stages of thought. 

6. The notions of beauty and ugliness are occidental concepts, unknown to 
primitive peoples. The notion of beauty is specious. Western man cannot 
agree on what is, in fact, beautiful. It would be desirable to get rid of this 
notion and teach men that all objects may be sources "of fascination 

and illumination." 

In conclusion, Dubuffet states: 

/ don't find the function of assembling colors in pleasing arrangements 
very noble. If painting were only that, I should not lose one hour of my 

time in this activity Painting operates, through sigfis which are not 

abstract and incorporeal like words. The signs of painting are much closer 
to the objects themselves. Furthermore, painting manipulates materials 
which are themselves living substances. That is why painting allows one 
to go much further than words do in approaching things.

It is peculiar to painting that it can, at will, conjure things more or less; 
in other words, with more or less presence, or at different stages 
between being and non-being. 

finally, painting can conjure things — not in isolation — but linked to 
all that surrounds them; a great many things simultaneously. 

Fainting is a more immediate and direct vehicle than verbal language, 
much closer to the cry; or to the dance; that is why painting is a vehicle 
for expressing our inner voices which is more highly effective 
than that of ivords . . . ? 

Prinzhorn's book encouraged Dubuffet to reject two of the most basic tenets 
of occidental culture: the value of categorical thought (points 1 to 5) and 
the notion of beauty (point 6). The Hellenic principle of Logos, part 
of our cultural heritage, comprehends consciousness of self, logical reason- 
ing, analysis and classification, language and free (purposeful) will. Dubuffet 
dismissed this Logos, to invent his own — a Logos (ironically so-called) 
which posits a moving and unoriented continuum as the only basis for 
our knowledge. According to this Logos, all things are relative, equal and 
subject to change. Without categories, it is without given values and 
hierarchies; the concepts of true and false, beautiful and ugly, real and 
unreal do not exist. 6 

It would be impossible not to evoke certain parallels with Surrealism at this 
point. In the twenties, Dubuffet was personally close to many of the 
Surrealists, and it is probable that a number of conceptual seeds were 
planted in his mind at that time. The Surrealists similarly considered cate- 
gorical thought an impoverished aspect of the true workings of the mind. 
As Andre Breton stated in the Second Surrealist Manifesto of 1930: "There 
is every reason to believe that there exists a point in the mind where life 
and death, the real and the imaginary, the past and the future, the 
communicable and the non-communicable, the above and the below, cease 
to be perceived as contradictions. It would be vain to seek in Surrealist 
activity another motivation than the determination of this point." 7 

For the Surrealists, automatism would open the doors to the true process 
of thought. Breton defined Surrealism itself as automatism: "surrealism. 
noun, masculine. Pure psychic automatism by which one proposes to express 
either verbally, in writing or by any other vehicle, the real functioning 
of the mind." 8

Paulhan, Henri-Pierre Roche and 
Michel Tapie. 



The Surrealists furthermore rejected the notion of art as an end in itself. 
Breton said in Les Pas perdus: "It would be an error to consider art as an 
end .... painting, for example should not have for its end the pleasure of 
the eyes. ... I persist in believing that a picture or sculpture is justifiable 
only insofar as it is capable of advancing our abstract knowledge properly 
speaking." 9 

Dubuffet never aligned himself with the movement and the point of non- 
contradiction which he sought was quite different from theirs. What the 
Surrealists sought was an exceptional state of poetic consciousness, 
producing hallucinatory images of sur-reality, most of which occurred at the 
verbal level. Dubuffet's objective was neither sur-reality nor so-called 
objectivity but what one might call trans-subjectivity: the visions and 
delusions of an ordinary un-selfconscious subjectivity, situated at a level of 
the pre-verbal unconscious. 

A secondary effect of Dubuffet's exposure to Prinzhorn was the constitution 
of a collection of what he called Art Brut. Prinzhorn had a collection of the 
art of the mentally ill which Dubuffet visited in Heidelberg many years later. 
His publication of case-history monographs is modeled after the case 
histories found in Prinzhorn's 1922 publication. 

Dubuffet's collection, as he described it in 1963, consists of "works of all 
kinds — drawings, paintings, embroideries, modeled or sculpted figures, etc. 
— which present a spontaneous and strongly inventive character, as little 
indebted to customary art or cultural models as possible and of which the 
authors are obscure individuals, alien to the milieu of professional artists." 
It is neither naive art nor Surrealist art, both of which are merely offshoots 
of cultural art, but "propositions of themselves unpredictable and wholly 
invented both in medium (materials, techniques, etc.) and in their inspiration. 
. . . we require that the works considered . . . correspond to a feverish 
impulse and not to some episodic stimulus or caprice where exaltation plays 
little part." 10 Dubuffet emphasizes that it is not psychopathic art, even though 
more than one half of the works in the collection are by asylum patients. 

It is significant that two of the sponsors of the collection when it was 
officially established in 1948 were Andre Breton and Charles Ratton. 11 
In May of 1948, Dubuffet wrote to Breton: 

The share which is attributed to you in the Compagnie de l'Art Brut is 

yours by right, for your ideas, humors and impulses surely played a large 



rule in orienting our attention towards these activities, and it was only 
fitting that your place be set at that table; and if you had not wanted to 
sit doivn with us, your place would have remained empty, like the angel's 
place which is set; it would be occupied by you in our thoughts. 12 

During those months, Dubuffet and Breton made frequent visits to the flea 
market at the Porte de St. Ouen (the northern limits of Paris), to find objects 
of primitive art and Art Brut. The two were drawn to primitive art as an art 
that escapes the canons of classical Western culture. They saw in it a vitalism 
and an identification with natural forces which they found lacking in 
occidental art. Breton also had a lasting interest in the art of the insane. In 
another letter dated August 9, 1948, 13 Dubuffet mentions an article to 
appear in the Cahiers de la Pleiade in which Breton was to discuss madness 
and "expose his point of view which is also mine that there is no such thing 
as madness and that the insane (les fous) are no more insane than the sane 
(les non-fous) . . ." 

Charles Ratton was the leading authority on primitive art in Paris. He 
furthermore was one of Dubuffet's earliest supporters. It was he who 
recommended Dubuffet to Pierre Matisse when the New York dealer made 
a post-war trip to Paris, looking for new artists. 

The works Dubuffet started collecting in France and Switzerland in 1945 
are the products — for the most part — of what could be called schizophrenic 
artists. These artists usually lived in an uninspirational, socially isolated 
environment; in extreme cases, an institution (such as a prison or an 
asylum); in others, merely an isolated province. The schizophrenic artist 
creates for his personal satisfaction alone. An unacknowledged and 
unintentional social therapy, his art is the invention and projection of a 
surrogate world for an oppressive world to which he cannot adapt. It be- 
comes his reality, secreted for his personal use as a milieu in which to enact a 
fantasy life. Since his goal is not communication but a closed-circuit dialogue 
with himself (or with an imaginary audience of his own making), he is free 
to invent his own language, making up the rules as he goes along. This 
language usually contains certain constant characteristics: deranged syntax, 
compressed imagery, and a purely affective logic, all of which are indicative 
of a strongly introverted subjectivity. 

Dubuffet has always believed in the superiority of the anti-social alienated

13. Letter to Gaston Chaissac, Ibid., vol. r r 

II, pp. 279-80. believes that alienation is the condition proper to real creative activity: 



In our time, when the aspiration to the social is so unanimous (and 
"alienation" is so decried), the creation of works of art is no longer 
admitted — as a matter of fact, it is not even conceived — other than 
addressed to the public, borrowing its language and aiming to conquer it 
and receive its applause. That an artist may be entirely disinterested in the 
public, even detest it, appears inconceivable to all. And the conditioning 
of our minds is so strong and so persuasive that the artists themselves 
(not only the professionals of cultural art but also those who under other 
conditions would be disposed to create real tvorks of art), escape it only 
with the greatest difficulty, and unless there is a solid wall, like that of 
some form of insanity, they let themselves little by little be seduced .... 
/ believe that there is an irreducible antagonism between the creation of 
art and a desire to communicate with the public. That antagonism 
confounds the artist; he refuses to assume the position of "alienation" 
implied by the creative activity, and vainly attempts to reconcile his work 
with a desire to be integrated into society and receive honors and awards 
. . . Creative invention has surely no greater enemy than social order, with 
all the appeals to adapt, to conform, to mimic, which social relationships 
imply. Creative invention can only survive in taking the opposite stance, 
refusal and impermeability. 14 

The above comments and quotes provide insights into the sources of 
Dubuffet's inspiration. Dubuffet addressed himself to the signs and symptoms 
of madness as expressive of the universal creative impulse, uncontaminated 
by cultural inhibitions. Ironically, it is through his extreme lucidity, self- 
discipline, and single-minded convictions that he has arrived at an art form 
which is in many ways close to that of madmen. It is unpredictable, ap- 
parently illogical, defiant and impervious to the solicitations of socio-cultural 
approbation. Art historical analysis is inapplicable to it except in negative 
terms. Truly, the only way we can come to terms with Dubuffet's art is 
by aligning it with Art Brut. "Art Brut" as Lawrence Alloway described 
it in 1966 "does not consist of savage and simple images, the awful imagery 
of a primordial mind erupting in art; on the contrary, psychotic and lay art 
is more usually the product of compulsion and systematic delusion. It is not 
the violence of a psychotic, which occurs in this world . . . that shapes his 
art. On the contrary, psychotic and lay art tend to create an alien realm by

16. As mentioned earlier, Dubuft'et was not 
ignorant of art history nor blind to 
what was going on around him. How- 
ever, it is our intention to concentrate 
on his relationship to Art Brut. This 
does not obviate other sources, in- 
fluences, and analogies which can be 
found in relating Dubuffet to "cul- 
tural" phenomena such as the painters 
Klee, Fautrier, Leger, the writers 
Artaud, Queneau, Celine, to mention 
only a few.

Gardes du corps (cat. no. 1) where 
Dubuffet used a professional male 
model.

19. In conversation with the author, 
January 31, 1972. 



Dubuffet's art is the opposite of heroic. It is conceived in terms of the vision 
of the ordinary man, it aspires to the immediacy of the spoken word, and it 
rejects all art-historical models. 16 His subjects are not noble; furthermore, 
they are conspicuously limited. The themes of the human figure, landscapes 
and a third theme — the mundane object — are the recurrent subjects of 
his life-long activity. Within this simple iconographical framework, there 
are however shifts of emphasis. The human figure predominates through 
the mid and late forties, to be replaced by stones, tables, cows and land- 
scapes in the fifties and early sixties. The subjects of the Hourloupe cycle, 
begun in 1962, are dominated by man-made objects: coffee pots, bottles, 
beds, basins, scissors. Nonetheless, a first impression of obvious subject 
matter is deceptive. Dubuffet has rarely painted from a model 17 or from 
nature. His models are residual mental images, of the same species as those 
of untrained artists or the artists of Art Brut. 

By presenting the viewer with images of unaccustomed banality or crudeness, 
Dubuffet seeks to jolt him out of his acquired aesthetic responses. ". . . when 
one has looked at a painting of this kind, one looks at everything around 
one with a new refreshed eye, and one learns to see the unaccustomed and 
amusing side of things. When I say amusing, I do not mean solely the funny 
side, but also the grand, the moving and even the tragic aspects 
[of ordinary things]." 18 "The secret," Dubuffet has remarked in conversa- 
tion, "is to do a thing badly. If you serve someone spinach that is cooked 
the way it should be, no one notices or remembers that they have eaten 
spinach. Whereas if you burn it, it shocks their taste-buds and they become 
immediately aware that it is burned spinach and they gain new insights 
into the characteristics of spinach, cooking, etc." 19 

Dubuffet's natural option in 1943 was to be a figurative artist. Abstract art 
was a recondite metaphor, not the popular vernacular he sought. 
However, to Dubuffet, the conventions of figurative art were sclerotic and 
semantically empty: "noble" subject matter, three-dimensional perspective 
space, volumetric illusion (with foreshortening and modeling), hierarchical 
composition (focusing on "essential" subject matter), "meaningful" color 
relationships and the use of a number of accepted media and techniques. 

One of the dominant conventions of post-Renaissance figurative art is 
that of three-dimensional perspective space. The convention of perspective 
is, however, unknown to the Art Brut artist. As Dubuffet has written: 
Effects of perspective are constantly found in the art to which we are 
accustomed; we are in fact so accustomed to it that we have difficulty 



understanding images which are organized according to another 
principle . . . But ordinary art depicts the perceived world .... Whereas 
. . . mental space does not resemble three-dimensional perceived space and 
has no use for notions such as above or below, in front of or behind, close 
or distant. [Mental space] presents itself as flowing, whirling, meandering 
water and therefore its transcription requires entirely different devices 
from those deemed appropriate for transcribing the perceived world. 20 

Since 1943, Dubuffet's paintings emphasize a two-dimensional surface. In 
paintings where the figure predominates — between 1943 and 1950 — it 
exists in a variety of complex relationships to the surrounding space or 
ground, none of which allows any illusion of overlapping or depth. For 
example, in Danseuse de corde (cat. no. 4), the flattened silhouette of the 
rope-skipper is interlaced in an uninterrupted pattern of line and color. In 
other paintings of 1944, the figure is as though cut out and placed on a 
uniform or patterned field. In the Macadam series and the portraits of 
1945-47, some figures are incised into thick impasto, whereas others are 
built up on it. The Grotesque Landscapes of 1949 are animated by trans- 
parent line drawings whereas the Corps de dames series of 1950-51 
presents drastically flattened effigies which are sometimes bled into the 
surrounding field. At all times, the space is defined as a two-dimensional 
surface, a deliberate option on the part of the artist: 

The objective of painting is to animate a surface which is by definition 
two-dimensional and without depth. One does not enrich it in seeking 
effects of relief or trompe-l'oeil through shading; one denatures and 
adulterates it ... . Let us seek instead ingenious ways to flatten objects on 
the surface; and let the surface speak its own language and not an artificial 
language of three-dimensional space which is not proper to it ... .1 feel 
the need to leave the surface visibly flat. My eyes like to rest on a surface 
which is very flat, particularly a rectangular surface. The objects repre- 
sented will be transformed into pancakes, as though flattened by a 
pressing iron. 2 ' 

During the next decade, when the human image is less central, spatial depth 
and relief are consistently absent. One of the artist's more frequent themes — 
the table — is conceived as a four-legged two-dimensional shape. Ironically, 
Cezanne's "tilted" table-tops are recalled by the culturally-conditioned eye. 
Dubuffet's tables, however, are pushed to an illogical extreme. They are not 

20. Dubuffet, Prospectus, vol. I, pp. 447-48. the depicted illusion of a three-dimensional reality, but tables as "seen"in 

21. Ibid., vol. I, p. 74. the irrational mind's eye. 

14 



Landscapes, an increasingly prevalent theme, are similarly tipped, flattened 
and fitted to the rectangular frame. When they are inhabited by figures, the 
relationship of figure to ground is rarely one of surface to depth. In some 
cases the figure has no substance; it is seared into the landscape (La Chevre 
egaree, cat. no. 6z). In others such as the Tableaux d' assemblages of 
1955-57 (La Pointe an pitre, cat. no. 86), figure and ground appear to be 
cut from a single fabric and reassembled, like a patchwork quilt. The horizon 
line, when it exists, functions as a decorative border, not as a demarcation 
evoking outlying space. Sometimes the "sky" has more physical substance 
than the "earth" which exists as a mentally animated void. By 1958, all 
spatial separations have disappeared and Dubuffet's mental landscape 
stretches from edge to edge, creating an uninterrupted unified pattern. 

Nonetheless the indication of identifiable subjects or objects in the paintings 
prior to 1962 tempts the viewer to project a figure-ground reading on these 
two-dimensional surfaces. Through cultural habit, he imagines a disparity 
between a three-dimensional subject and a two-dimensional depiction and 
injects illusions of relief or volume where none are intended. The Hoitrloupe 
cycle, begun in 1962, precludes this reading. The large early Hoitrloupe 
paintings illustrate a concept of all-over design which in America we 
identify with Jackson Pollock. Dubuffet's articulation of the all-over surface, 
however, is quite different in its sources and its elaboration from that of 
American Abstract Expressionism. 

As William Rubin has pointed out, Pollock's rhythmic network of gestures 
is close in form and feeling to Analytical Cubist "scaffolding." 22 In 
Pollock's mature drip paintings, one is conscious of a positive-negative 
superposition in the figure-ground tracery which permits a shifting from 
surface to depth and back, and an illusion of an opening and closing of the 
field determined by human impulse. Dubuffet's Hoitrloupe paintings present 
none of these illusions. The surface is hermetically sealed, a jig-saw-like 
mosaic of tightly interlocking cellular forms. Each form is closed and of a 
piece; yet, as in Pollock, the system is self-generating. 

Perhaps the basic difference lies in the fact that Dubuffet's imagery refers to 
another level of human discourse: that of the even monotonous flux of the 
irrational or pre-logical mind. His formal equations are uninterrupted,

The Hourloupe cycle reflects the culmination of Dubuffet's pictorial 
ambitions. The form adopted for the Hourloupe paintings, said Dubuffet 
in 1969, is 

that of an uninterrupted and resolutely uniform meandering script, 
(unifying all planes to the frontal plane, paying no heed to the particular 
space of the object described, neither its dimensions, nor its distance nor 
closeness) thereby abolishing all particularities, all categories (by which I 
mean the usual classifications adopted by our reflexive mind which makes 
distinctions between one notion and another: between the notion of chair 
for example and that of tree, that of human figure, cloud, ground, land- 
scape, or anything else) so that this consistently uniform script indiffer- 
ently applied to all things (and it should be emphasized, not only visible 
objects but also invisible inventions of our thoughts, imagination or 
fantasy; mixed together without discrimination) will reduce them all to 
the lowest common denominator and restitute a continuous undifferen- 
tiated universe; it will thereby dissolve the categories which our mind 
habitually employs to decipher (better to say to cipher) the facts and 
spectacles of the world. Herewith the circulation of the mind from one 
object to another, from one category to another will be liberated and its 
mobility greatly increased } x 
To sum it up, Dubuffet says one paragraph later, "my operation is to erase 
all categories and regress toward an undifferentiated continuum." 

This text is crucial to the understanding of Dubuffet's pictorial priorities. 
The elimination of the categories of rational thought translates pictorially 
into a suppression of differentiated planes, hierarchical composition, color 
as value, and other traditional aspects of the work of art as it exists in 
Western culture. 

Obviously, Dubuffet would have to shun illusionism in terms of fore- 
shortening and modeling. Yet an equivocation between what is reality and 
what is illusion — such as is generally found in figurative painting — persists. 
Usually this form of equivocation arises from a tension in the viewer's mind 
between an absent reality and an illusion which is present. But Dubuffet 
reverses these terms. What is present is a concrete presence or reality. What 
is absent is an illusion or mental image which served as the model for the 
concrete reality now before the viewer. 

The term which qualifies this kind of ambiguity is the French word 
simulacre, a term the artist chose for one specific phase of his activity: the 
24. Letter to Arnold Glimcher, see fn. 6. black and white sculptures of 1 969. As the artist explained in the same letter

of 1969, 25 the French word simulacre signifies une apparence sensible qui se 
donne pour une realite, or a physical (sensuous) presence which proposes 
itself as a reality. The example Dubuffet selects is that of ghosts or appari- 
tions. Ghosts appear as real presences when in fact they are figments of the 
viewer's imagination. Dubuffet' s images, although endowed with an 
undeniable concrete presence, are in fact the transcription of illusions. 
Concrete reality is not their source. They are deliberate delusions to which 
the artist has given shape, substance, form and presence. 

Although in the letter quoted above, the artist is describing one specific 
phase of his activity, his remarks elucidate not only the form but the content 
of his life's work. These three-dimensional works, says Dubuffet, "are 
endowed with an equivocal status, which produces a wavering in the mind 
between the function of material objects and that of immaterial figurations 
of objects." He continues, saying that although these objects address them- 
selves to the viewer in the form of three-dimensional objects, they are in fact 
pure mental evocations. Their materiality is specious. Their objecthood is 
fallacious. They are the mere materializations of mental operations. They 
cannot be considered sculpture; rather they should be considered three- 
dimensional painting, which is to say they are three-dimensional illusions. 
The artist also considered calling these works "mental derivatives endowed 
with physical substance" but discarded this as too unwieldy. 

Dubuffet's process is the realist painter's process in reverse. Starting from an 
illusion, he invents a physical reality. Dubuffet has compared this process to 
a "sausage-machine run backwards." "Many artists begin with the pig and 
make sausages. I begin with sausages from which I reconstitute a pig." 26 

Thus, a painting of a coffee pot (cat. no. 133) is the embodiment of an idea 
of a coffee pot; a materiologie is the interpretation of a mental landscape 
(cat. nos. nz-115); a portrait is the depiction of a conceptualization of a 
friend (cat. nos. 25-32). In a deliberate attempt to confound the viewer, 
these "mental derivatives" are endowed with a strong physical presence. 

Sustained contradictions between the imaginary and the literal are charac- 
teristic of Art Brut. Dubuffet saw this in one of the artists in his collection: 
"Every aspect reflects a flagrant desire on the part of the artist to confer not 
a physical but a mental character to these images; however simultaneously 
the artist's heavy lines, and his choice of harmonious and powerful coloring 
reflect the aim to endow the site with a strongly convincing physical 
presence." 21

28. These works belong to Dubuffet's 
series of itstensiles utopiques or 
imaginary, functionless utensils. 



The Corps de dames series of 1950-51 offers a group of examples where 
the equivocation between a conceptualization and physical substance is 
eloquently projected. At first contact, the viewer is assaulted by an effect of 
flagellated, or disintegrating, smeared or bruised flesh. He is as though 
confronted with his own desecrated body. The impact of a visceral exposure 
of flesh is achieved through the combined aspects of the indeterminate 
configuration of the image and the surface which abounds with haptic 
incident. Most of the figures are close to flesh color; yet the wine-colored 
tints which generally predominate endow the bodies with an unhealthy 
aura of imminent decay. 

One cannot remain indifferent to these images; yet one never succumbs to 
the illusion that these are real human entities. As subjects, they have no 
psychological presence; as objects, their physical volume is reduced to a 
flattened skin pinioned to the canvas. Nonetheless, they elicit a violently 
physical response. Dubuffet has given concrete shape and substance to a 
generalized concept of femaleness. It is the substantiation of that idea which 
has trespassed into the world of our experience. 

Similar responses and incongruities are found in relation to the series of 
1951-52.: Landscaped Tables, Landscapes of the Mind, Stones of Philosophy. 
Despite the heavy impasto of these paintings — in which the relief is 
sometimes highlighted by a glistening varnish — the titles indicate that these 
are metaphysical images. 

In the Hourloupe paintings, such physical-mental contradictions are 
attenuated. The flat vinyl surface of these works does not address itself to the 
viewer as a physical presence but as a transcription of the oscillations of the 
pre-reflexive psyche. Furthermore, the elimination of natural and associative 
colors reinforces the character of these works as landscapes of the mind. 

It is conceivable that Dubuffet progressed from the radically flat Hourloupe 
paintings into three-dimensional works for reasons related to the preceding 
discussion. Paintings such as Fusil canardier (cat. no. 134) or Cuisiniere a gaz, 
as unequivocal mental images, cannot be confused with physical entities. 28 
However, the translation of these fantasy constructs into three-dimensional 
objects amplifies the illusion-reality conflict to an unprecedented degree. 
As Dubuffet stated: 

It is perhaps in the chair series that I have most felt the discomfort result- 
ing from the confusion of an object with its figuration. What I mean is 
when the configuration of an object becomes an object itself. A painter 
who depicts a chair on a flat canvas does not fear for a moment that his

depiction will be taken for a real chair, or, in other terms, that his 
evocation of a chair will slip from the world of evocations into the world 
of existing objects, objects susceptible in turn to give rise to evocations. 
One ivould never entertain the idea of sitting on a chair depicted on a 
canvas whereas if the same chair depiction is produced in three dimensions 
and thereby given volume by the sculptor, one would be tempted to do so. 
When I say given volume, 1 mean given attributes which liken it to real 
objects, before which the mind is confounded and reacts to it not as the 
transcription of a movement of the mind responding to an object but 
simply as an object belonging to the perceptual world. It no longer belongs 
to the world of the mind but belongs to the physical world, not to say 
the functional world — the world of chairs on which one sits .... 

The very particular point (point of the mind I mean) where an equivo- 
cation between the imaginary and the real arises, that point between the 
domain of evocations and that of objects, posing the greatest threat of 
slipping from one to the other, that point produces in me uneasiness and 
discomfort but at the same time it exerts a fascination over me to the 
point of not knowing if I fear it or if I seek it out and solicit it. 29 

Dubuffet's most recent series, the praticables, is an extension of this idea. 
A praticable, or practical, is a kind of theater prop: a real object (such as a 
telephone) divested of its real functions, to become the representation of that 
object on the stage. Thus, throughout his career, Dubuffet has created 
situations of extreme perceptual instability and intellectual uneasiness 
disguised in terms of the utmost banality. 

In his endeavor to dismantle the edifice of categorical thought and to cele- 
brate the aberrations of the pre-reflexive mind, perspective and illusionism 
are only two of the filters which Dubuffet shatters. A third one is composi- 
tion: an acquired discipline based on value judgments, analysis and synthesis, 
and implying a movement toward self-determination and communication. 
The schizophrenic artist ignores these premises. In contrast to the common 
visual syntax of professional artists, his idiom is loosely structured according 
to the most elementary human patterns: isolation, serial repetition, vertical 
stacking, chaotic accumulation, frontality and symmetry. 

Dubuffet, like all "unexceptional" Frenchmen who have been through the 
French educational system, had a mind inherently structured by the axioms 
of Cartesian analysis. Yet in his Anticultural Positions/ he expressed his 
distrust of value judgments and analysis. In his work, the distinctions 



2-9 



between what exists and what does not, between reality and non-reality, 
between thinking and feeling, perceiving and imagining are deliberately 
blurred. Figures float and tilt, upside down and sideways, filling the frame 
of the canvas whose flat planar surface is the only space they respect. 
There is no acknowledgment of external-world concepts such as gravity. 
Accepted pictorial premises — relationships of figure to ground, figure to 
figure, part to whole, whole to part, harmony, contrast, tensions — are 
equally ignored. So that the pictorial problems and solutions produced by 
the "artistic" manipulation of these principles are boldly lacking throughout 
Dubuffet's work. 

Whereas the notion of compositional structure is never inborn, a color 
sense, although in large part conditioned, appears to have some innate basis. 
Dubuffet has always had a highly developed color sense, despite his efforts 
to obliterate it. In 1946, when Pierre Matisse had just become Dubuffet's 
New York dealer, he showed some paintings to his father in Paris. Henri 
Matisse looked at them with a puzzled expression. After a long pause, he 
said: "I do not understand what it is all about, but he has an extraordinary 
sense of color." He added, "And it's a very French sensibility." 31 

Clearly, in 1946 (at the age of forty-five), Dubuffet was still a victim of his 
"educated" sensibility. The paintings bear this out. Starting in 1943, Dubuffet 
launched an attack on good taste. As such, it was largely unsuccessful. 
The paintings of 1943-44 are pleasing. They are almost facile in their appeal 
as compared to the varied degrees of repugnance which Dubuffet's succes- 
sive cycles of work have inspired. Since his aims were obviously incompatible 
with his personal instincts, Dubuffet resorted to material such as gravel, 
cement, Swedish putty, sand (and at other times leaves, bark, banana peels, 
butterfly wings), which would impose their own natural hues. Elsewhere he 
worked with distemper, glazes, emulsions, plastic paints, zinc oxide and 
resin varnishes. These media, spilling into one another, clotting, bleeding, 
coalescing, created their own chromatic mixtures and color interaction. 

Despite these experiments, Dubuffet was still unsuccessful. No matter how 
the artist sought to stifle his color impulses, prior to 1962. and the Hourloupe 
series, his color is consistently sensuous and appealing. It is direct in its 
expression, subtle in its variations, supremely evocative and largely unex- 
pected, due to its dependence on unprecedented materials. We cannot — nor 

do we wish to — remain indifferent to Dubuffet's color, and its psychic

So that the Hourloupe series represents the ultimate solution: an arbitrary 
restriction of the palette to red, white, blue and black, and, concurrently, a 
complete disaffection for natural or the imitation of natural materials, with 
their subtle values and associations. Since Dubuffet rarely used flat primary 
colors prior to that time, this choice appears as a deliberate sub- 
stitution. This palette, which one can conjecture ran counter to his innate 
sensibility, surely corresponded to new priorities. Red and blue, as used here, 
are neutral colors lacking in associative power; the function of color in the 
Hourloupe paintings is as unevocative and non-expressionist as the 
continuum of ciphers — or visual equation — that graphically articulates 
their surfaces. 

The bright or brutal colors of Dubuffet's earlier work simultaneously 
enhanced and denied the reality of the image. The result was an evocative — 
both real and elusive — imagery such as the subjective mind secretes. 
The function of color in the Hourloupe cycle is quite different. Since from 
the outset, the Hourloupe imagery is more radically removed from the 
perceptual world, color serves to project and determine abstract conceits 
in visual terms, according to a closed, non-associational, self-referring 
system. In other words, the injection of primary color in flat planes or 
striations gives immediate and literal presence and substance to what are 
essentially pure "mental derivatives." 

Dubuffet's initial approach to materials was founded on the idea that con- 
ventional techniques inspire conventional imagery whereas unaccustomed 
non-art instruments, supports and media stimulate the mind to 
unprecedented adventures. A fundamental characteristic of Art Brut is a 
dependence on "materials of fortune." In his compulsive need to project 
and create images, the schizophrenic artist adopts any medium at hand. 
"Materials of fortune" are literally anything. The repertory found at 
La Compagnie de I' Art Brut includes leaves, volcanic stone, pumice, cement, 
sea-shells, leather, string, bread, vegetable peels, coal, glass shards. Tools 
range from a spoon handle to a ball-point pen; supports include the wood 
paneling of a room, wrapping paper, blotting paper, fabrics. 

The notion that any and all materials may serve the cause of popular art 
appealed to Dubuffet. Although oil paint was Dubuffet's most common 
vehicle between 1943 and 196Z, he transformed it, creating emulsions, 
thickening it with sand and glue to an opaque and gritty paste, and con- 
sistently defiling its traditional identity. At other times, Dubuffet resorted to 
extraneous materials such as tar, gravel, lime, plaster, asphalt, even mud.

vol. II, p. 133. 

34. Lawrence Alloway, op. cit., p. 16. 



According to Dubuffet's definition, art, like life, is accident-prone. All men 
are artists; all products of the creative urge fall under the heading of art. 
The artist is not a demiurge but an ordinary human being; he is thereby 
susceptible to the vicissitudes of fortune that that implies: 

. . . the artist is harnessed to fortune; (art) is not a dance to be danced 
alone, but as a couple; fortune is the partner. It pulls one way, ivhile the 
artist guides it as he can but with flexibility, working to take advantage of 
the fortuitous as it presents itself, trying to mold it to his ends, never 
precluding a deviation from his original goals at any moment . . . .It is 
not exactly with just any fortune that the artist is involved, but with a 
particular kind of fortune, indigenous to the material employed. The term 
fortune is inexact. Better to speak of the inclinations and aspirations of 
the medium as it resists his hand. 

It is a duet between the artist and his medium. Each must speak freely 
and directly and visibly his own language. One must allow all the fortunes 
proper to the material to emerge . . . To try to prevent these vagaries of 
fortune would be to deprive the work of all vitality.* 2 

Dubuffet invited accidents; he courted chance. He consented to what others 
would correct as errors. As Max Jacob, one of his early mentors, said, 
"Error alone is fertile." " In the extreme cases of the Materiologies and the 
Texturologies, of 1957-60, the mind and hand of the artist appear to play 
no role at all. Some of his titles such as La Vie sans I'homme ("Life without 
Man") are descriptive of a painting and a psychic state. There remains no 
visible trace of the passage of a reflexive mind. The protagonist is "matter." 

The Hourloupe series was born of doodlings with a ball-point pen. 
Conceived as proliferating mental imagery, the success of the Hourloupe 
depends on the absence of immediate sensuous allusions. As Lawrence 
Alloway pointed out in 1966: ". . . in place of the emphases possible with a 
split nib, the succession of pauses and replenishments, the ball-point gives 
a hard, unaccented, continuous line. In 1964 the drawings with markers 
develop the unaccented line further; the evenly plump track of a felt pen, 
strongly but softly, produces a quasi-streamline." 34 

Ball-point pens and markers (or felt-tipped pens) are modern man's most 
pedestrian writing utensils. Thus an impersonal anonymous medium gave 
rise to Dubuffet's most depersonalized and generalized ideational forms. 



32- 



Dubuffet's generation is characterized by disenchantment. The artists and 
philosophers who came of age after World War II looked for alternatives to 
an idealistic humanism conceived as inappropriate to the modern world. 
God being dead, man discovered himself critically alone, responsible to 
himself and to his fellow men, with no traditional beliefs to guide his life. 
As Bergson and Freud were among their spiritual mentors, an acknowledge- 
ment of the powers of the unconscious in determining man's relations to 
the world is also important to understanding their spiritual positions. Since 
man's real substance is his psychic life — a moving flux of undetermined 
impulses — to define him as a prime mover of the universe appeared as 
erroneous a claim as the medieval belief that the earth was flat. On the 
contrary, the universe moves, forms and finally qualifies man. So that the 
role of individual responsibility (and the question of personal identity) in 
this interplay of forces had to be reassessed. 

Sartre believed that man can determine his identity through his acts. 
Camus (who occupies a transitional position between Existential and Post- 
Existential thought) took a more skeptical stance. Questioning the myths 
that man is good or free, he inferred that man's motivations are not naturally 
noble or meaningful. And, although responsible only to himself, he is 
nonetheless imprisoned in an inextricable network of relationships with 
others which greatly determines his behavior. Camus saw man as neither 
pawn nor hero but as anti-hero, existing somewhere between these poles. 
Neither totally dependent on outside forces, nor totally responsible, 
he is only relatively responsible. 

The delicate balance which Camus portrayed between man's free will and 
the contradictory fabric of his existence was subsequently tipped to a more 
pessimistic perspective. Post-Existential artists like Beckett and Ionesco 
see the environment in which we live as destructive of any will to act. 
Their anti-hero exists as a simulacre: an abstract cipher parading in the guise 
of man. He interprets events as the fruits of his own initiative when it is 
obvious they are not. He moves or is moved . . . toward nothing in particular. 
He speaks ... in empty cliches. As Dubuffet has said in another context, 
his reality is specious, his objecthood is fallacious. 35 Yet this is the configu- 
ration of modern man: a diffuse presence of humors and psychic states 
with no evident identity. 

The parallels with Dubuffet's art are obvious. His landscapes are unde- 
35. See page 27 here. termined fragments of space and time in which the waves and eddies of 



33 



subjective thought confront the external forces of materials. His objects, 
discovered out of context, are emptied of their accustomed specificity. 
His human figures are without motion or expression; they are nameless 
ciphers of man. 

Throughout Dubuffet's work extreme psychic isolation is portrayed. 
The objects of his perception are bound by no determined relationships 
either in time (sequence) or in space (to surface, depth, center, edge) or to 
other figures. Their positioning is arbitrary; they may be moved from place 
to place. Their scale may be altered without affecting the whole. If identity 
is defined as a convergence of specific relationships, clearly Dubuffet 
paints nonentities. 

The fortuitous placement of perceptual objects in a field is found consistently 
in Dubuffet's art. It is explicitly visible in the Assemblages d'empreintes 
(1953-54) an d tne Tableaux d' assemblages (1955-57). The works in these 
two groups were arrived at through the random cutting and assembling of 
textured surfaces, surfaces also prepared at random. In reference to these 
series, Dubuffet has expressed his satisfaction at being able to shift and 
displace images before fixing them with glue. 36 In his current work, the 
praticables, his freedom is even greater, and again it was the problem of 
distributing figures in a visual field which inspired this solution. "I conceived 
the praticables," he related in conversation, "in order to create free figures 
and independent grounds and subsequently assemble them in any combi- 
nation." 37 In the three series mentioned, the figures and their environment 
are of identical substance: spattered India ink in the Assemblages 
d'empreintes, maculated canvas in the Tableaux d'assemblages, a continuous 
chain of cellular forms in the praticables. As a result, no matter how it is 
placed, the figure does not function as an additive or relational component. 
Visually it dissolves or locks itself into a continuous formal and 
textural fabric. 

Dubuffet's anti-relational imagery translates a freedom from hierarchical 
imperatives, a freedom won at the expense of composition, illusionism, 
perspective, color interaction, in a word, at the expense of "art" as his 
generation knew it. Psychologically, it was achieved by observing madness or 
the disintegration of categorical thought. Like the Art Brut artists he admires, 
Dubuffet freely constitutes celebrations, based on delusions, which he offers 
as an alternative to everyday life. Yet beneath the surface of the simulacres, 

36. Dubuffet, Prospectus, vol. II, pp. 116-17. praticables and mirages, there exists an undercurrent of tragic humanism, a

Remarks on the Unveiling of 
The Group of Four Trees, 
New York, October 24, 1972 

JeanDubuffet 
translated by Benita Eisler 



At this time I should like to offer a 
few explanatory remarks about the 
monument whose installation we 
are celebrating today. 

Obviously, the work stands in full 
view of everyone here and each of 
us must now look at it with his own 
eyes and bring to it his own asso- 
ciations. My own belief is that a 
work of art fails in its function if its 
meaning is too limited. I believe 
that the meaning, or rather the 
meanings, of any work of art should 
be wide open so that each of us can 
absorb it into our own particular 
universe. (I am referring, of course, 
to our mental universe.) 

With your permission, I should like 
to offer a few guidelines to the 
aims and mental processes which 
guided my hand in the conception 
of this monument. 

This sculpture forms part of a cycle 
of my works to which I have given 
the name L'Hourloupe, and which 
was begun in 1962, or ten years ago. 

I should mention in passing that 
L'Hourloupe is a word whose 
invention was based upon its 
sound. In French, these sounds 
suggest some wonderland or gro- 
tesque object or creature, while at 
the same time they evoke some- 
thing rumbling and threatening 
with tragic overtones. Both are 
implied. 



In my thinking, the works that 
belong to the Hourloupe cycle are 
linked one to the other, each of 
them an element destined to be- 
come part of the whole. The cycle 
itself is conceived as the figuration 
of a world other than our own or, 
if you prefer, parallel to ours, and 
it is this world which bears the 
name /' Hourloupe. 

The works originating in this cycle 
are in the form of sinuous graph- 
isms responding with immediacy 
to spontaneous and, so to speak, 
uncontrolled impulses of the hand 
which traces them. Within these 
graphisms, imprecise, fugitive and 
ambiguous figures take shape. 
Their movement sets off in the 
observer's mind a hyperactivation 
of the visionary faculty. In these 
interlacings all kinds of objects 
form and dissolve as the eyes scan 
the surface, linking intimately the 
transitory and the permanent, the 
real and the fallacious. The result 
(at least, this is the way it works 
for me) is an awareness of the 
illusory character of the world 
which we think of as real, and to 
which we give the name of the real 
world. These graphisms, with their 
constantly shifting references, have 
the virtue (to me, I should add 
again) of challenging the legitimacy 
of what we habitually accept as 
reality. This reality is, in truth, only 
one option collectively adopted, to 
interpret the world around us — 



35 



one option among an infinity of 
equally legitimate possibilities. 
Had any one of these other options 
been adopted at the dawn of human 
thought, it would today offer the 
same impression of reality that we 
now confer upon the established 
one. Thus, as you can see, a philo- 
sophic humor presides over the 
works of the Hourloupe cycle — 
introducing a doubt about the true 
materiality of the everyday world. 
It too may be only a mental 
construct. 

At the beginning, this cycle in- 
cluded only drawings and paint- 
ings. Subsequently, I wished to 
give them greater corporality. I 
undertook to assimilate them to 
three-dimensional forms, present- 
ing, as do all solids, several sides 
to the observer. The result was 
objects of equivocal status. They 
have been called painted sculptures, 
but this term is not really accurate. 
Rather, they should be considered 
drawings which extend and expand 
in space. 

I then desired to endow these un- 
leashed graphisms, these lines 
escaped from the flat sheet of their 
usual support, with monumental 
dimensions. 

I could not have hoped for a place 
better suited to this monument, 



austerely intellectual in concept, 
than the plaza where it stands to- 
day, a site richly distinguished by 
the high intensity activities which 
take place here. Its specific char- 
acter — in another sense, to be sure, 
and in other directions, but with 
unquestionably as much authority 
and, I would even say, poetry — 
symbolizes with impressive force, 
the effectiveness of human thought. 
Indeed, this plaza, and the prodigi- 
ous buildings which rise above and 
surround it, are the dramatic illus- 
tration of an extraordinary cele- 
bration of reason, logic and 
calculation. 

I do not believe that these four 
trees, which I hope will not be taken 
as representations of real trees but 
as semblances of the thrust and 
fertility of human thought, bear 
contradiction in any way to the site 
upon which they now stand. In- 
deed, in their capricious and aber- 
rant graphisms, they give an im- 
pression — and this was intentional 
— of feverish intoxication. But they 
seem to me, by this same febrility, 
to manifest the ardent source of the 
enormous intellectual machinery 
of which this plaza is the core. 

I confess to being deeply moved 
that New York, this city so mar- 
velously welcoming and marve- 
lously eager to embrace every bold 
intellectual innovation, fearlessly 
accepted this allegory.

Elocution faite a l'occasion 
de l'inauguration du groupe 
des quatre arbres 

Jean Dubuffet 



Je voudrais maintenant donner 
quelques indications sur le monu- 
ment dont nous fetons ici 
aujourd'hui l'erection. 

II est bien vrai qu'il s'offre aux 
yeux de tous et chacun doit mainte- 
nant le regarder avec ses propres 
yeux et ses propres associations 
d'esprit. Je crois qu'une oeuvre 
d'art ne remplit pas ce qui est 
attendu d'elle si sa signification est 
trop limitee. Je crois que la signifi- 
cation ou plutot les significations 
d'une oeuvre d'art doivent etre 
ouvertes largement de maniere a 
permettre que chacun puisse la faire 
entrer dans son univers propre. 
Bien sur, c'est son univers mental 
que je veux dire. 

Mais c'est sur les visees de son 
auteur, et sur les positions d'esprit 
qui ont conduit sa main dans la 
conception de ce monument que je 
veux maintenant fournir, si on veut 
me le permettre, quelque eclair- 
cissement. 

Ce monument s'inscrit dans un 
cycle de mes travaux auquel j'ai 
donne le nom de L'Hourloupe et 
qui a pris naissance en 1962, c'est 
a dire il y a maintenant dix ans. 

Je mentionnerai en passant que ce 
mot de L'Hourloupe est un nom in- 
vente en fonction de sa consonance. 
Celle-ci, en francais, evoque a la 
fois quelque objet ou personnage 
de statut feerique et grotesque, et 
aussi par ailleurs quelque chose de 
tragiquement grondant et mena- 
cant. Les deux ensemble. 



Dans ma pensee les travaux 
rattaches a ce cycle de L'Hourloupe 
sont lies les uns aux autres, chacun 
d'eux etant un element destine a 
s'inserer dans Pensemble. Celui-ci 
veut etre la figuration d'un monde 
autre que le notre, un monde, si Ton 
veut, parallele au notre, et c'est ce 
monde qui porte le nom de 
L'Hourloupe. 

Mes travaux procedant de ce cycle 
mettent en oeuvre des graphismes 
sinueux repondant avec immedia- 
tete a des impulsions spontanees 
et, pour ainsi dire, non controlees, 
de la main qui les trace. Dans ces 
graphismes s'amorcent des figura- 
tions incertaines, fugaces, ambigues. 
Leur mouvement declenche dans 
l'esprit de qui se trouve en leur 
presence une suractivation de la 
faculte de visionner dans leurs lacis 
toutes sortes d'objets qui se font 
et se defont a mesure que le regard 
se transporte, liant ainsi intimement 
le transitoire et le permanent, le 
reel et le fallacieux. II en resulte — 
du moins est-ce ainsi que cela 
fonctionne pour moi — une prise de 
conscience du caractere illusoire du 
monde que nous croyons reel, 
auquel nous donnons le nom de 
monde reel. Ces graphismes aux 
references constamment ambigues 
ont la vertu — elles 1'ont pour moi, 
veux-je toujours dire — de mettre 
en question le bien-fonde de ce que 
nous avons coutume de regarder 
comme realite et qui n'est en verite 
qu'une option collectivement 
adoptee pour interpreter le monde 



37 



qui nous entoure parmi une infinite 
d'autres options tout autres, qui 
ne seraient ni moins ni plus 
legitimes. Si l'une ou 1'autre de ces 
autres options avait ete adoptee a 
l'auhe de la pensee, elle nous 
donnerait aujourd'hui la meme im- 
pression de realite que nous donne 
celle qui s'est trouvee prevaloir. 
Comme vous le voyez done, 
preside a ces travaux du cycle de 
L'Hourloupe une humeur philo- 
sophique . . . introduisant un doute 
dans la vraie materialite du monde 
auquel nous avons journellement 
affaire. II pourrait hien n'etre 
qu'une creation de notre pensee. 

Ces travaux dans leur debut re- 
couraient seulement a des dessins 
et peintures. II est advenu que j'ai 
ensuite eprouve le desir de leur 
donner plus de corporalite. J'ai 
entrepris de les associer a des 
formes tridimensionnelles et offrant 
done au regard, comme tout solide, 
plusieurs cotes. II en est resulte des 
objets de statut equivoque. On les 
a designes sous le terme de sculp- 
tures peintes mais cette expression 
est un peu erronee. C'est plutot de 
dessins s'elancant et s'expansant 
dans l'espace qu'il faut parler. 

Le desir m'est venu alors de donner 
a ces graphismes dechaines, a ces 
graphismes s'echappant de la feuille 
plane qui leur sert habituellement 
de support, des dimensions 
monumentales. 

Je ne pouvais pas esperer, pour y 
eriger un monument revetu de ce 



statut austerement mental, un lieu 
mieux adapte a l'y voir erige que 
n'est cette place ou je le vois au- 
jourd'hui, si fortement dotee elle- 
meme — dans son aspect, dans les 
activites de haute tension qui s'y 
exercent — d'un caractere qui, 
d'une autre maniere, il est vrai, par 
de toutes autres voies, mais avec 
autant d'autorite sans doute, et, 
dirai-je aussi, de poesie, symbolise 
avec une intensite saisissante les 
efficiences de la pensee. Dans cette 
place en effet et dans l'ensemble des 
edifices prodigieux qui la surplom- 
bent et l'avoisinent se voit drama- 
tisee une extraordinaire fete qui 
est celle de la raison, de la logique 
er du calcul. 

II ne me semble pas que ces quatre 
arbres, dont je souhaite qu'ils soient 
recus non comme des images de 
vrais arbres mais comme des sem- 
blances des elancements et arbo- 
rescences de la pensee, portent 
contradiction au site ou ils sont 
maintenant places. Ils ont en effet, 
et je l'ai voulu ainsi, avec leurs 
graphismes capricieux et aberrants, 
une allure d'ivresse enfievree. Mais 
ils me semblent, par cet enfievre- 
ment meme, manifester la source 
brulante de l'enorme machinerie in- 
tellectuelle dont ce site est le coeur. 

Je suis fort emu que New York, la 
ville merveilleusement accueillante 
et merveilleusement eprise de toutes 
les hardiesses dans le domaine des 
novations de la pensee, n'ait pas 
craint cette allegoric

Works in the 
exhibition 

Oeuvres exposees 



The following checklist is divided 
into four sections: 

I. Paintings, butterfly wing 
assemblages and small statues 

II. Works on paper including prints 

III. Illustrated books 

IV. Three-dimensional works from 
the Honrloupe cycle 

In each section works are listed for 
the most part chronologically. 
However, in certain cases strict 
date order is not followed so as to 
respect the unity of groups of 
works based on a particular theme 
or executed in a single medium. 

Dimensions are given in inches and 
centimeters; in both cases height 
precedes width. 

The notation L. Fasc , fig 

refers to the Catalogue des travaux

Max Loreau, and listed on pages 
301-303.

Catalogue des travaux de Jean 
Dubuffet, Paris, Jean-Jacques Pauvert, 
editeur; Weber editeur 

The following is a listing of the 
volumes (fascicules) of the catalogue 
raisonne of Jean Dubuffet's work. 
Organized chronologically, each fas- 
cicule includes an introduction by 
Max Loreau, a complete and fully 
illustrated inventory of the works of 
each period, press excerpts, selected 
bibliography and index. A summary 
of each period is provided below in 
order to orient the visitor to the 
present exhibition. 



I. Marionnettes de la ville et de la campagne (1942-1945) 
(Marionettes of the city and the country) 

City and country scenes in which the style is reminiscent of 
Art Brut: schematic figures, vibrant color distributed in 
flat planes, no perspective. In 1944, the colors become more 
somber and monochrome, inspired by interest in graffiti. 

II. Mirobolus, Macadam et Cie (1945-1946) 
(Mirobolus, Macadam and Co.) 

Experiments with diverse "non-art" materials (thick 
impasto incorporating sand, pebbles, glass). Large single 
figures in a frontal hieratic stance are incised or built up 
in these materials. Low-key, sometimes iridescent colors. 

III. Plus beaux qu'ils croient (Portraits) (1946-1947) 
[Handsomer than they think (Portraits)] 

Imaginary portraits of writers and artists among Dubuffet's 
friends in which the general characteristics of each — as 
Dubuffet subjectively sees them or freely extrapolates — are 
captured. No attempt at literal resemblance. 

IV. Roses d' Allah, clowns du desert (1947-1949) 
(Roses of Allah, clowns of the desert) 

Three visits to North Africa inspire images of desert life: 
the vast uninterrupted landscapes, the insignificance and 
anonymity of man, the "guttural" quality of Arab life and 
language. Small formats, many works on paper, experiments 
with materials (colored crayons, distemper). 



V. Paysages grotesques (1949-1950) 
(Grotesque landscapes) 

Landscapes animated with figures, and unified by a general 
chromatic tone, probably inspired by the artist's desert 
experience. The transparent line figures wander at random 
or are still, incised into the slight gradations of several layers 
of color on the field. 

VI. Corps de dames (1950-1951) 
(Nude female figures) 

"Celebrations" of the female who appears as a cult object, a 
flattened effigy, an eroticized landscape. Simultaneously an 
assault on the classic ideal of the female nude. Experiments 
with oil emulsions produce the dissolved contours, bleeding 
colors and fluid textures of some of these paintings. 



301 



VII. Tables paysagees, pay sages du mental, pierres 

pbilosopbiques (1950-1951) 
(Landscaped tables, tables of the mind, stones of 
philosophy) 

Heavy relief, sometimes high varnish, producing a contra- 
diction between the abstract (mental) imagery and a 
strong physical presence. Deliberate submission to the 
accidents of materials (plastic resins). 1951-52: series of ink 
drawings: Terres radieuses (Radiant Lands), in which an 
uninterrupted cellular structure forecasts the Honrloupe 
cycle. 

VIII. Lieux momentanes, pates battues (1952-1953) 
(Momentary places, mixed impasto) 

Vast landscapes in which the artist's incisive gesture and 
high color animate the surface rather than configura- 
tions induced by the materials themselves. 

IX. Assemblages d'empreintes (1953-1954) 
(Imprint assemblages) 

The first butterfly-wing assemblages of 1953 show interest in 
cellular form; they also determine the color and structure of 
the imagery. In the assemblage of fragments of ink transfer 
drawings into ephemeral landscapes with fantastic figures, 
once again the materials guide the artist's inspiration and 
hand. 

X. Vacbes, Petites statues de la vie precaire (1954) 
(Cows, little statues of precarious existence) 

Small figurines in clinker, sponge, charcoal, whose very 
existence is threatened by the fragility and imminent decay 
of their substance. Pastoral scenes in which the protagonists 
are anti-heroic (tragic) cows. 

XI. Cbarrettes, jardins, personnages monolitbes 
(1955-1956) 

(Carts, gardens, monolithic figures) 

Painted in Vence in the south of France. Speckled landscapes, 
burned-out color, brittle contours, depiction of dry vege- 
tation, pebbly soil. Second series of butterfly-wing assem- 
blages depicting gardens in which the artist reinforces the 
web-like structures through paint. 



XIII. Celebration du sol I, lieux cursifs, texturologies, 
topographies (1957-1958) 

(Celebration of the earth I, cursive places, 
texturologies, topographies) 

Interest in texture leads to the representation of vast 
"topographies" or undetermined landscapes. The assem- 
blage technique is used in some of them, soon to be replaced 
by all-over painterly grounds. 

XIV. Celebration du sol II, texturologies, topographies 

(1958-1959) 

(Celebration of the earth II, texturologies, 
topographies) 

Further development of the preceding period. All indications 
of scale are abolished, creating an ambiguity between a literal 
fragment of the earth and a vast undifferentiated landscape. 

XV. As-tu cueilli la fleur de barbe? (1959) 
(Did you pick the beard's flower?) 

Series of beard-scapes, beard effigies, beards in every form. 
Accent on texture through graphic incident. Celebration of 
the beard as hair, but also evoking grass, dust, natural 
accidents and particles of the soil. 

XVI. Les Phenomenes (1958-1963) 
(Phenomena) 

Lithographic encyclopedia of textures relating to diverse 
natural phenomena. 15 volumes of black and white 
lithographs, 9 volumes of color lithographs. 

XVII. Materiologies (1958-1960) 
(Materiologies) 

Assemblages of botanical materials: all kinds of leaves and 
vegetation, dried banana peels, bark. Desire to bow to nature. 
October 1959: second series of small figurines made of 
driftwood, papier mache, metal foil. 

XVIII. Dessins (1960-1961) 
(Drawings) 

Three series of ink drawings in which effects of texture and 
problems of figure-ground contiguity are explored. 



XII. Tableaux d' assemblages (1955-1957) 
(Assemblages of painted canvas) 

After the India ink assemblages, the artist executed assem- 
blages of fragments of spattered canvas, encouraging un- 
expected juxtapositions and accidental configurations. The 
mosaic pattern of irrational forms anticipates the Hourloupe. 



302. 



XIX. Paris Circus (1961-1961) 
(Paris Circus) 

First long stay in Paris since 1954. Retreat from fascination 
with natural materials; return to the stage of marionettes 
(1943-44): street scenes, shops, restaurants; bright lush 
colors; works more densely (and ambiguously) orchestrated 
than the works of 1943-44. Birth of the Legends series of 
phantasmagoric polychrome apparitions which prefigure 
the Hourloupe. 

XX. Hourloupe 1 (1961-1964) 

July 1962.: red and blue ball-point doodlings give rise to 
aberrational configurations, purely imaginary cellular figures. 
Progressive restriction of the palette in gouaches and paint- 
ings; progressive dematerialization and abstraction of images. 
Interest in "errors" and irrational wanderings of the mind. 
December 1963: begins to work with vinyl paint. 

XXI. Hourloupe U (1964-1966) 

Emphasis on vast mental landscapes consisting of larger 
modules (cf. Nunc Starts) and in which the imagery is less 
easily decipherable. Series of isolated domestic objects as 
landscapes. Finally the painting becomes a pure irrational 
chain of non-signifying forms. 

XXII. Cartes, ustensiles (1964-1967) 
(Playing cards, utensils) 

1964: Creation of Hourloupe playing cards (Banque de 
1'Hourloupe, Algebre de I'Hourloupe) so that each may try 
his hand at the game of chance. "Utopic" (or non-functional) 
"utensils", utopic places, each of which contains a world. 

XXIII. Sculptures Peintes (1966-1967) 

(Painted sculptures) 

The equivocal universe of the Hourloupe translated into three 
dimensions: road markers, human figures, accumulations of 
domestic objects, chairs, all of which are non-functional, 
ambiguous. 

XXIV. Edifices, Monuments (in preparation) 
(Edifices, monuments) 

Utopic architectures, environments, town houses, rooms, 
monuments.
