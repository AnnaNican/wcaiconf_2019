Jan MuUer. January 1958. 



JA&gt; Ml'LLER-S LIFE BY DODY .MLLLER 



Jan Miiller was born in Hamburg. Germany, on December 27, 1922. He died 
on January 29. 19.58. in \ew lork City. 

In 1924, when Jan was one and one-half years old. his parents. Heinrich and 
Lisa, and his older sister Ruth, moved from Hamburg to Xiiremberg for ts\ o years, and 
from there to Brandenburg, i\here Maren, his younger sister was born. In Brandenburg 
he attended school, which he disliked. He showed no exceptional interest in painting, 
although the family as a whole was artistic. But his feeling for life itself was intense and 
fuU of force. To run. to be in the sun. in the woods, to play on box cars in railroad yards, 
to be in street battlesâ all those strange games that are mysterious and forbidden to 
adultsâ were the childhood of Jan Miiller. 

Then, it was 1933. 

Hitler came to power. Jan"s father was arrested. When friends had bribed his 
release, it was obvious that the parents could no longer remain active against the Xazis 
in Germany. At the end of 1933. Jan went with his family to Czechoslovakia and stayed 
in Prague for five months. The sudden influx of political refugees was a new but not 
unconunon phenomenon and the city was not able to cope with it. 

From Prague, his father went to France and Jan went ^\ith the rest of the family 
to Bex-Les-Bains in Switzerland. His mother took a teaching position at a boarding 
school, Ecole Xouvelle La Pelouse. which Jan and his sisters attended. There, thirteen 
vears old. Jan had the first attack of rheumatic fever. 

In the summer of 1936. Jan. his mother and sisters went to .\msterdam. Two 
vears later, in Julv 1938. he and his sister, Ruth, went to Paris. The second attack of 



rheumatic fever came and the recovery was slow and only partial. Afterwards, he at- 
tended school, he taught himself French and began to read a lot and to write poetry and 
essays. In May 1940. he was interned as a German refugee and sent to a camp near Lyons. 

Paris fell. In June 1940, France signed the Armistice with Germany. Jan was 
released from camp, and with Ruth moved to Ornaisons, near Narbonne in the south 
of France. Despite the difficulties and insecurities attending the journey, the south of 
France made so profound an impression on Jan that he later recalled it in his painting 
as radiant with light and beauty. The light of the south was to live in all his painting 
and he loved France dearly. 

In September of 1940, he went to Marseilles to try to obtain a visa to the United 
States. However, as he was of draft age and still considered German, he could not get 
an exit visa from France. Twice, he, Ruth and their father tried unsuccessfully to cross 
the Spanish frontier. Finall) % in February 1941, at the third try, Jan and Ruth managed 
to get into Spain and traveling through Barcelona and Madrid, reached Lisbon, Portu- 
gal, where they joined their father. From there they left for the United States at six 
month intervals. Jan left Lisbon in the middle of May and arrived in New \ork on June 
3, 1941. Shortly thereafter, his mother and Maren were interned by the Nazis in Amster- 
dam. The)^ were sent back to Germany where they were held until after the ^^â¢ar. In New 
York, Jan began to teach himself English by spending hours reading in the public library. 
For the first time he read a translation of Faust. 

He settled immigration problems by going to Canada and re-entering the 
United States on a regular quota. Then he went to a work farm in Ohio to return even- 
tually to New York where he had j obs as a dishwasher, a day camp instructor, a laborer 
in a ball-point pen factory and a film cutter. None of these were of interest to him except 
as a means of livelihood. However, the experience of putting together the various frames 
of films required in film cutting was later to influence his use of "close-ups"' and "long 
shots" in the triptychs and hanging pieces. He was intrigued by the movies and would 
spend much time there. The whole experience of paying for a ticket at the box office, 
entering the black movie house, the movies themselves, the people inside, was of endless 
fascination to him. 

Jan's interest in politics continued for a while, but as his conviction in the moral 
and ethical issues of our times began to express itself in his art, he withdrew from active 
participation in political matters. 

In 1945, at the end of the war, Jan's mother and his sister. Maren, came to the 
United States. That same year he began to paint. First, he attended the Art Students 
League for six months and then he went to study with Hans Hofmann from 1945 to 1950. 
Although there were many arguments as a result of the widely diverse ideas that sep- 
arated pupil from teacher, he always maintained deep respect, admiration and sincere 
love for Hans Hofmann and for his work. 



Out of that period came an exhibition called 813 BROADWAY, in which the 
participants were Miles Forst. John Grillo, Lester Johnson. Felix Pasilis, Wolf Kahn 
and Jan. It was during this time and until 1953 that Jan painted in a mosaic style. From 
1954. his paintings became more figurative. 

In a sense, the 813 BROADWAY exhibition contained the rudiments of the 
Hansa Gallery which was to form on East 12th Street and which opened in the autumn 
of 1952. \^ith Jan. such artists as Jean Follett. Barbara Forst, Miles Forst, Wolf Kahn, 
Allan Kaprow, Felix Pasilis and Richard Stankiewicz were among the founders. For 
the next six years. Jan was to have a show there each vear. 

The summers of 1950, '51 and '52 were spent in Provincetown, Massachusetts, 
but by no\\-, the damage done to his heart by the rheumatic fever and past deprivations 
could no longer be allayed. At that time, Jan had a loft on Broadway across from Grace 
Church. He then moved to Bond Street and in 1953 decided to undergo an operation 
to replace the damaged valve with a plastic one. It was assumed that the operation, if 
successful, would make him well. The operation took place in the spring of 1954. It 
was not successful, although this was not certain at the time. Also, the valve was audible 
which was most disconcerting to him. And yet. his major works were to be painted in 
the four vears that remained to him. 

In the smnmer of 1955. Jan returned to Provincetown. He began the series of 
"path"' paintings. They are straight paths, circular paths, double and single, some 
curved, some nearly blocked, but all leading to eternity and to the sun. 

It was also in Provincetown. in 1956. that he married Dolores James. That 
summer he painted OF THIS TIME-OF THAT PLACE, HAMLET AND HORATIO 
and the WALPURGISNACHT-FAUST I. In the following autumn the couple moved 
to 342 Bowery where Jan was to paint the second FAUST and in the subsequent spring. 
THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY Although the paintings became stronger 
and his artistic convictions clearer, and although he was happier then, his health deteri- 
orated further. In this year and in those that followed, he never suffered less than four 
attacks each night. 

The summer of 1957 was again spent in Provincetown. In spite of another 
eight-week attack of rheumatic fever, Jan painted THE CONCERT OF ANGELS, THE 
SEARCH FOR THE UNICORN and THE GREAT HANGING PIECE. 

On December 30, 1957. he became a Lnited States citizen. His sixth exhibition 
at the Hansa opened on January 6. 1958. Soon after, he was to begin the painting of 
the reverse theme of Jacob's Ladderâ of Hell and Conformity. It remained unfinished, 
but it is all there, nevertheless. Jan did not fear physical deathâ but the horror in life, 
the Hell of conformity and spiritual death. But the spirit of life, the spirit of freedom, 
the freedom to search, and the faithâ the faith beyond searchingâ are here in the witches, 
the angels, the paths, and the Man on the Horse. 




The Temptation of St. Anthony. 195 . . Lent by Mrs. Jan Miiller. New York. 



JAX MILLER-S ART BY THOMAS M. ME5SER 



The work of an artist of originality and power will alwavs ui\ite discussion, 
stimulate ideas and engage our intellect. Before allowing the play of ideas to unfold, 
there is. however, the \v ork itself to be seen and to be secured within ourselves. 

The ^"iewer s reaction conies first: a sense of largeness and of monunientalitv : 
a sense of apparition and of mystery: a sense of amoralit\- and of purity: a sense, first 
of life and ^dtalitx". and then of fatality and death. 

Questions come thereafter: how did this painting evolve? from where did it 
draw its strength? how does it relate to broader currents? what did it achieve? 

The sequence of work is simple enough, brief as it is. spanning not more than 
ten years. Eclectic beginnings are followed by cubist exercises from about 1948 to 19.50. 
Miiller"s advanced apprenticeship in the abstract idiom is carried out in Hans Hofmann"s 
workshop from 1950 to 1953. The decision to recreate subject matter through the use of 
an abstract vocabulary and. thereby, to break ranks in the Hofmann school comes in 
1953. Thereafter, graduallv. in various stages, we witness the assertion of his o\\"n mas- 
tery. Jan MiiUer, having used his abstract schooling to reconstitute the object in his paint- 
ing. no^\" forms the new figurations within a context of philosophy, religion, mythology, 
and literature, without sacrificing to any of these the potent visual impact of his art. 

In the process of this development, the initial stress upon geometric order is 
abandoned in favor of free, organic form: his early concern \\ith the structuring of 
the surface appears to give way to the exuberant demands of an expressive art: color, 
at first an object of experimentation, comes into its owTi, fuUy and jubilanth". In other 
words, the painter's strong romantic propensities, ha\'ing been tempered by a self- 
imposed classic discipline, carry the day. 



Jan Miiller"s painting is founded upon the unitv of subject matter with form. In 
his mature period, the successful solution of formal problems is taken for granted and 
subject matter becomes the conscious determinant of his art. It is the subject that tests 
the successful development of his technical means and that is the measure of his inventive 
capacity. Through the subject. Miiller evokes a spiritual dimension and a sense of the 
universal. By the essential identity of subject matter and of the formal solution, Miiller's 
art is decisively removed from the level of illustration and endo\\'ed with plastic sig- 
nificance. 

In his early, abstract phase. Miiller builds his canvases with pure form and 
lets the non-objective order furnish the content and meaning of his art. Soon there- 
after, forms begin to arrange themselves in a way that clearly announces the figurative 
element in the making. Cautiously, almost as if engaging in forbidden games, Miiller 
allows the recognizable motif to emerge from within the abstract pattern. First land- 
scape, then flower still-life and the figure are the resultsâ with landscape offering itself 
as descriptive prose, still-life as lyric poetrv and the figure foreshadowing an epos that 
is to become Miiller's crowning achievement. 

For his late epic phaseâ the phase of thematic subject matterâ nothing less is 
required than the great texts of world literature: The Bible. Cervantes, Shakespeare, 
and Goethe, and specificall\ . the heroic passages in Genesis. Don Quixote, Hamlet, and 
Faust. Of these, the German poem provides the most potent literarv stimulus for Miiller's 
contemporary vision. . â  

Two of his monumental works are devoted to the Faust legend. Thev are niis- 
leadingly entitled FAUST I and FALST II. for both paintings reflect the romantic 
setting of the first part of the great dramatic poem. Miiller is inspired by the medieval 
German scene and the cramped Gothic world. In works that derive from the Faust 
theme, he paints Mephisto, the old German Teufel, with his witches and hexes who 
appear fancifullv arrayed or stark-naked, showing a bare-faced grimace or wearing 
a death-white mask, as they roam over the hills and dales of a bizarre landscape north 
of the Alpsâ shrieking, gesturing, and otherwise indecorously preoccupied, in the tumul- 
tuous orgv of a Walpurgisnacht. Demons and angels, heaven and hell, in their Goethian 
interpenetration emanate from Miiller's central Faust subject and inhabit other works

in which the mythological theme remains implicit. Such paintings as THE CONCERT 
OF ANGELS, THE VIRGINS or THE ACCUSATION are indicative of the centrifugal 
force which the imagery of Faust exerted throughout Miiller s subject matter. Finally, 
unnamed, but ubiquitous are THE MOTHERS. Goethe's Miitter, this awesome and 
awful archetype of life-bestowing, redeeming femininit}" which, in its angelic and ab- 
stracted transformation, as DAS EWIG-WEIBLICHE. concludes the poem of Faust. 

To establish Miiller s specific contribution, we might w ell ask ourselves what 
he has done that others have not. To answer we must begin with Eugene Delacroix, per- 
haps the last of the great 19th centurv masters with whom literature remained at the 
source of painting. After Delacroix, in a main line that continues until the First \^orld 
\^ ar. painting is exposed, in one sense, to a successive purification and. in another, to a 
parallel impoverishment. 

\^ith Courbet and Cezanne, painting freed itself from its literarv source and. 
as the cliche goes, "ceased to be the hand-maiden of literature". The theme was aban- 
doned in favor of the object. As Picasso and the cubists proceeded with their attenua- 
tions, dissections and fragmentations, the object, in turn, was abandoned in favor of 
form that is free from all but itself. The audacious steps taken by the pioneers of modern 
painting led to the geometric solution of a Mondrian. Between the two wars, surrealism 
and the art of fantasv. re-established contact with the object but did so in terms that 
stood apart from the sequence here considered. Miiller's point of departure, therefore, 
remained pure formâ Mondrian's legacy. This he received from Hans Hofmann, his 
teacher, who relayed it with such enrichments as the years, the expressionist tradition 
and Hofmann's own vital artistry had given it. 

^Tien, in the early 1950's, Miiller begins to question the sufficiencv of an 
esthetic of pure form, the idiom of abstract expressionism had already revealed its 
representational potential. The late Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. David 
Park and Elmer Bischoff and possibly others had either approached, returned to or 
skirted the borderline of the recognizable. \\ hen. therefore, Miiller moves toward rep- 



resentation. he is neither first, nor is he alone. His decisive contribution must not be 
sought in his neo-figurative participation, but in the re-integration of the figurative with 
literature and nivthology. 

By readopting literary subject matter and by realigning it with the formal exi- 
gencies of contemporary art. Miiller re-emphasized an aspect of painting that had all 
but disappeared in our time. To be sure, the religious theme appeared frequently in the 
work of the earlier twentieth century- masters, and one thinks in particular of Emil Nolde 
from whom Miiller inherited certain expressive devices. But in their thematic painting, 
iXolde and other German Expressionists stayed, for the most part, within a territory 
defined at one end by purely Biblical motifs and at the other by a religiously predicated 
private myth. Miiller. on the other hand, appears to have reached past such recent pro- 
totvpes for a romantic source. In this sense, he returns to the creative sphere of 
Eugene Delacroix. 

But questions remain : first, if the entire strength of modern inventiveness has 
been marshalled to set painting free from presumably encumbering fetters, if every 
effort has been bent toward the establishment of an artistic independence from literature 
and from the object, whv then is the restitution of these components an asset rather than 
a mere return to a discarded ideal? The answer must state that Miiller's work marks a 
return only in one sense, and that a seeming backward motion is balanced by an onward 
mov^ement which secures his placement with today s advanced guard. 

Then, lastlv. if we admit his work in terms of original innovation, and in terms 
of stylistic uniqueness, does this suffice? Is it enough in art. to have found something 
new, to have done what others have not. to be leading, or to be alone? Again, one would 
replv in a qualified negative and conclude that excellence, while often reaching toward 
the unexplored, does not attach itself necessarilv to the new. 

The substance of Miiller s painting cannot, therefore, be assessed in terms of 
old or new but must be sought in the work itself. \\e find it in Jan Miiller's strong and 
earnest art.
