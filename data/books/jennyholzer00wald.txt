PREFACE 



At Times Square or Caesar's Palace, on t-shirts and 
posters, Jenny Holzer has taken the arresting language of her art 
to the streets. She has also presented more contemplative writings 
to a smaller gallery audience. This first major presentation of 
Holzer's work in a New York museum provides the artist with a 
middleground between the outdoor public spaces and the more 
private gallery interiors in which she usually shows her texts. As 
always. Holzer has taken advantage of the specific qualities of the 
site in presenting her work. 

At a decisive point in her career, at the end of more 
than a decade of work, Holzer has used the remarkable spiral of 
the Frank Lloyd Wright building to wind together major selections 
from her previous writings as well as new texts into a focused and 
provocative spectacle of electronic light. Her large-scale spiral sign 
and her stone benches draw attention to the monumental architec- 
ture of the Museum, yet at the same time, the fleeting messages 
of the sign and the aphorisms and inscriptions engraved perma- 
nently on the surfaces of the benches often reveal, behind a voice 
of authority and certainty, the fragility of the human condition 



As the Guggenheim begins the restoration of its radical 
and now historic building, the Jenny Holzer exhibition underscores 
the institution's traditional and ongoing commitment to art that is 
new and challenges its audience It is particularly appropriate too 
that the Guggenheim Museum, whose sister institution, the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection, is located in Venice, is showing the work 
of this important young artist who will represent the United States 
at the Venice Biennale of 1990 in the Guggenheim-owned Ameri- 
can Pavilion. Diane Waldman, the Guggenheim's Deputy Director, 
whose career-long dedication to the art of this century is well 
known, deserves my deepest gratitude for bringing this significant 
project to fruition.

ACKNOWLE DGAAENTS 



This exhibition and catalogue have been achieved 
through the essential support of many individuals. Jenny Holzer's 
involvement has been crucial to the exhibition's success. Her 
dedication and vision have made this project an exciting and re- 
warding undertaking. I would like to express my deepest gratitude 
to the National Endowment for the Arts for its commitment to 
Holzer's work and its generous sponsorship of the show. I am 
equally indebted to Jay Chiat for his enthusiasm and financial 
assistance. It is with sincere appreciation that I also acknowledge 
the continuing generosity of The Owen Cheatham Foundation, 
The Merrill G. and Emita E. Hastings Foundation and the New York 
State Council on the Arts, whose contributions have helped to 
make this exhibition possible. I appreciate as well the support 
given by anonymous donors. In addition, I am extremely grateful 
to Barbara Gladstone, without whose help this show could not 
have been realized, and to her staff at the gallery. My thanks are 
also extended to Paul Miller at Sunrise Systems, Inc., who devoted 
so much of his time and energy working with the artist on the 
spiral L.E.D. sign. 



The staff at the Guggenheim Museum has been 
instrumental in assisting me with this exhibition. I would particu- 
larly like to thank the following individuals for their efforts: Clare 
Bell, Curatorial Assistant, who skillfully coordinated all aspects of 
the show; Carol Fuerstein, Editor, for her astute editing of the 
catalogue; Myro Riznyk, Building Manager, whose technical 
expertise has been indispensable; Diana Murphy, Assistant Editor; 
Victoria Hertz, Assistant Registrar; Heidi Olson, Manager of 
Budget and Planning; David Heald, Photographer; Glory Jones, 
Public Affairs Associate, Lisa Dennison, Assistant Curator, Claudia 
Defendi, Curatorial Assistant, and Lisa Malm, curatorial intern 

Jenny Holzer has communicated her messages about 
modern culture through unbounded outdoor sites and within 
the controlled interior environments of the gallery and museum. 
This exhibition has been enriched by all those individuals and 
sponsors who, over the past decade, have made it possible for 
the artist to reach such a broad population.

THE LANGUAGE OF SIGNS 

Diane Waldman 



Like other artists who first came to prominence in the 
1980s, Jenny Holzer is a product of the TV age and the world of 
advertising and billboards. Her work reflects a decade in which 
originality is suspect and, as have many of her colleagues, she 
employs art and aspects of culture to comment on the nature of 
society and on the way in which art is perceived and received in a 
consumer society. Like many of her predecessors who appropriated 
the common object-notably Duchamp and Warhol -Holzer 
borrows freely from mass culture to explore some of the more 
pressing issues of our time, addresses concepts of originality and 
questions the value of the artist's hand in the making of the work. 
Unlike her forerunners, however, she questions the value of the 
artist's hand by contrasting the impersonal common object-the 
sign or the billboard— with a message that is personal and "sin- 
cere." She also uses ready-made objects such as electronic bill- 
boards because they bring with them an immediately recognizable 
level of meaning. In an age of excess, it has become increasingly 
difficult for artists to startle us, yet Holzer does so: her posters and 
signs are often subversive in content, her messages and their 
formats provoke and challenge our assumptions about art and its 
role in society today. 

Jenny Holzer's pieces range from simple one-liners to 
highly complex elegies and meditations on the human condition. 
Lean and elegant in appearance, the work is in fact a complex 
amalgam of conceptual premise, Pop imagery and ironic inter- 
change between object and void, presence and absence, sexual 
desire and individual loss. Holzer's media include printed signs, 
metal plaques, stone benches and sarcophagi as well as electronic 
signboards that depend on sophisticated technology Her texts 
have appeared on posters, tractor caps, stickers and billboards, 
on parking meters and store windows and inside telephone 
booths. These messages, couched in direct, unadorned language, 
have appeared randomly on the streets and have been presented 
in galleries and museums, on the eight-hundred square-foot 
Spectacolor Board in Times Square in New York, on the Sony 
JumboTRON video scoreboard in San Francisco's Candlestick Park, 



on the cable music-video channel MTV and in other highly visible 
public places. 

Holzer was born in Gallipolis, in Gallia County, Ohio, in 
1950. She was one of three children in the family, which lived in 
Lancaster, Ohio. Her mother taught riding in a college before her 
marriage and was an active participant in the community, her 
father was an athlete who became a Ford dealer. Holzer drew 
constantly as a child but stopped when she approached adoles- 
cence. She left Lancaster High School after a year to move to Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida, "to change her life and her lifestyle." 1 There 
she attended a private school, Pine Crest Preparatory. She tried for 
early enrollment in college and applied to Duke University in 
Durham, North Carolina, which accepted her into its liberal arts 
program in 1968. Holzer, however, quickly became dissatisfied 
with the program at Duke and decided to leave. 

Holzer spent 1970-71 at the University of Chicago, 
where she took painting, pnntmaking and other art courses. Al- 
though she liked the curriculum and faculty at Chicago, she left 
because the University wanted her to take an additional year of 
liberal arts courses. Holzer completed her undergraduate work at 
Ohio University in Athens in 1972, and two years later attended 
summer school at the Rhode Island School of Design in Provi- 
dence. Also in 1974 she met fellow RISD student Mike Glier, who 
was later to become her husband. She began graduate courses in 
Providence in 1975 and simultaneously worked as a graduate 
assistant. At this early point in her career Holzer was an abstract 
painter, influenced by artists like Mark Rothko and such color field 
painters as Morris Louis. She maintains that she was attracted to 
the sublime aspect of their art, but feels that her own work was 
only ". . . pretty good third-generation stripe painting." 2 Among 
her projects at RISD were a series of paintings in which she 
incorporated words that gradually assumed greater significance 
than images, a sequence of torn canvases and a group of pictures 
based on models of the fourth dimension. While still in graduate 
school, Holzer began to experiment with public art, which she 
notes was "a kind of precursor to my current work. . . putting 



things in public and leaving them for people to find, either down- 
town or at the beach." 3 She explains: 

At the beach I would make paintings on long pieces of 
fabric and leave them so that people would come 
along and wonder what this thing was that had obvi- 
ously been left by someone hoping to tickle their 
imaginations a little bit. Downtown I'd put bread out in 
abstract patterns so people could watch pigeons eat in 

squares and triangles But the works weren't beautiful 

enough or compelling enough or understandable 
enough to make people stop. 

I had also started a collection of diagrams. ... I thought 
that diagrams were the most reduced, the truest way 
of visual representation. So I collected them . . . and 
then redrew them, just to do something with them. 
And then I put the drawings in a box. I don't know 
exactly what made me shift, but finally I wound up 
being more interested in the captions than the draw- 
ings. The captions, in a clean, pure way, told you 
everything. This was the begmning-or one of the 
begmnmgs-of what got me to the pure writing. 4 

Holzer turned from a vocabulary of abstract imagery to 
"the pure writing" in 1977, when she began to produce her first 
series, the Truisms, which she continued to work on until 1979. 
Here her primary medium, like that of a number of Conceptual 
artists who directly preceded her, is language. Language fascinated 
Holzer because for her it communicated in a way that painting 
could not. She had by now determined that although she was not 
interested in narrative or social-realist painting, she wanted to 
make her feelings about society and culture known; she had also 
abandoned the idea of writing on her paintings. When Holzer 
moved to New York in January of 1977, she enrolled in the 
Whitney Museum's Independent Study Program. The reading list, 
which included studies in art and literature, Marx, psychology, 
social and cultural theory, criticism and feminism, inspired her to 
create the Truisms, which consisted of one-liners such as 
MURDER HAS ITS SEXUAL SIDE, THE FAMILY IS 
LIVING ON BORROWED TIME and ABUSE OF POWER 
COMES AS NO SURPRISE. Her "mock cliches," as she calls 
them, were her attempt to reformulate important statements by 
simplifying them She says, "I started the work as a parody, like 



the Great Ideas of the Western World in a nutshell." Her idea was 
to make "the big issues in culture intelligible as public art." 5 In 
attempting to represent all points of view, she often expressed 
directly contradictory meanings and feelings in the Truisms. Holzer 
was using the message, the medium and the public arena to 
identify and comment upon contradictions and extreme situations 
in society in the most neutral voice and in a laconic but sincere 
style she attributes to her midwestern background. She remarks 
that "Midwesterners are impatient with things that are too elabo- 
rate or too silly. They want to get things done so they do it in the 
most expeditious way-expeditious as in fast and right." 6 

Initially, using a rented typewriter, she typed the Truisms 
on sheets of paper; then she had them offset, first in Futura Bold 
Italic and then in Times Roman Bold type, as anonymous posters 
which she put up on buildings in SoHo, and afterwards elsewhere 
in Manhattan. The posters contained from forty to sixty Truisms 
apiece, arranged alphabetically according to the first word in each 
sentence, and, while every poster related to the rest, each was 
largely self-contained. The Truisms were followed by another 
poster series, the Inflammatory Essays, inspired by her readings of 
Emma Goldman, Hitler, Lenin, Mao and Trotsky as well as by some 
crackpot writings, they were begun in 1979 and pursued until 
1982. As with subsequent series, she has continued to use these 
writings in a variety of media. In the Inflammatory Essays Holzer 
deliberately chose at first to give the texts a very informal look by 
typing them on an old, broken typewriter, but eventually had 
them printed in Times Roman Bold. The Inflammatory Essays were 
more structured, political and exhortatory than the Truisms. More- 
over, Holzer standardized their format so they could be identified 
as part of the same series: each was a hundred words long and 
divided into twenty lines in the same size square. She used a differ- 
ent color support for each Inflammatory Essay "to heat up the 
whole thing," 7 whereas the Truisms had been presented in a 
format using black letters on white paper. 

From the posters Holzer moved on to t-shirts, tractor 
hats, billboard-size posters and collaborative projects which in- 
cluded small books. At this time Holzer saw her work as "alterna- 
tive art," but as it evolved she moved from statements in rela- 
tively ephemeral media to a more permanent, monumental and 
authoritative art, from what she calls "lower anonymous" to 
"upper anonymous." In 1980 she began a series of bronze and 
hand lettered wall plaques entitled The Living Series, in which she 
often rewrote news items and described mundane activities. 



10 



She was thus turning away from "Great Ideas," towards an 
involvement with everyday life 

Her real breakthrough, however, came in 1982, after 
her experience of working on her project for the Spectacolor Board 
in Times Square, when she began to use electronic signboards 
and, ultimately, LED. machines: matrices of computer activated 
light-emitting-diode lamps that display traveling texts and graphics 
in a variety of colors and presentation styles. When she first used 
the LED. signs, they displayed Truisms, soon, however, she cre- 
ated The Survival Series for them. The LED. boards have allowed 
Holzer to reach an even larger audience than she had commanded 
earlier. And through their programming capabilities she is able to 
evoke nuances of meaning and to elaborate on her social and 
political views and her ideas about other aspects of life. Moreover 
they are eminently suited to the device of repetition which Holzer 
often uses with her swift, accessible consumerist language to 
persuade the viewer effectively. In her series Under a Rock, first 
shown in 1986, and the Laments of 1988-89, Holzer employed 
stone benches and sarcophagi etched with poetic phrases together 
with electronic messages, thus juxtaposing elements that create a 
somber mood of contemplation with an intense and jarring 
physical presence. 

The Truisms and the series that immediately followed 
were original yet anonymous in tone. She worked at keeping 
some distance between herself and her audience to depersonalize 
the writing and to enlarge its meaning from the specific to the 
general. As she remarks about the Truisms, "I try to polish them so 
they sound as if they had been said for a hundred years, but 
they're mine ... to write a quality cliche you have to come up with 

something new." 8 

Over the past twelve years, however, Holzer's writing has 
gradually become increasingly subjective. This evolution proceeded 
from the impersonal, factual statements of the Truisms, moved to 
the Inflammatory Essays and The Survival Series, which address 
the third person, "you," and has culminated in the Laments, 
which for the first time feature the personal pronoun "I," which 
represents a number of different "I's," a group of varied individu- 
als. Thus Holzer has, for now at least, abandoned the role of 
narrator and objective observer, the role of Everyman. She has 
adopted personal voices to reflect private feelings and thoughts. 
Her advocacy of social and political issues continues, but with the 
advent of Under a Rock and the Laments, her expression of it has 
become both more individuated and more pensive. Holzer consid- 



ers the texts for Under a Rock a transitional stage in the develop- 
ment towards the very personal and reflective expressions of the 
Laments. In Under a Rock a commentator is watching horrific 
events and describing them as they happen, still in a relatively 
objective tone. Thus: 

CRACK THE PELVIS SO SHE LIES RIGHT. THIS IS 
A MISTAKE. WHEN SHE DIES YOl C \N\OT REPEAT 
THE ACT. THE BONES WILL NOT GROW TOGETHER 
AGAIN AND THE PERSONALITY WILL NOT COM I 
BACK. SHE IS GOING TO SINK DEEP INTO THE 
MOSS TO GET WHITE AND LIGHTER. SHI IS 
UNRESPONSIVE TO BEGGING AND SELF-ABSORBED. 

The Laments, on the other hand, are deeply thoughtful musings 
on cataclysmic events that have already occurred. Whereas Under 
a Rock is active, the Laments are introspective and comtemplative. 
For example

Holzer first showed elements of her Laments series at 
Documenta 8 in 1987. Here two sarcophagi and two LED. signs 
with texts that mirrored each other were installed, representing, 
according to the artist, male and female counterparts. Last fall she 
elaborated on the Laments in an installation of thirteen sarcophagi 
and thirteen signs entitled Jenny Holzer: "Laments" at the Dia 
Art Foundation for its space in Manhattan's Chelsea district. The 
Laments series expresses Holzer's social and political concerns 
in more explicit terms than those of her earlier works; here her 
message is more complex, and she speaks now of broader, more 
universal issues. The language of the individual signs and sar- 
cophagi retains its formidable clarity and directness but achieves a 
texture and nuance, an elegiac quality that is new to the work. 

The installation at Dia is notable for its drama and its 
heightened sense of urgency. Here Holzer pulls out all the stops to 
create an assertive, outspoken piece that controls and dominates 
the area it occupies. In the darkened space of the gallery, Holzer's 
flashing LED signs are positioned vertically and timed to go on 
at the same time and off at different intervals, eventually leaving 
the room in total darkness. The series of sarcophagi is placed in an 
adjacent room. These range from infant to child to adult size and 
each carries an inscription that is reiterated in the vertical signs. 
Light and dazzling optical effects, a sense of noise and speed ema- 
nate from the flashing signs, while silence shrouds the room in 
which the sarcophagi are located: the emotional disruption created 
by the contrast could not be more extreme This disruption situates 
both signs and tombs in the wreckage of our universe and speaks 
to us of our mortality and the absurd, nihilistic enterprise that is 
our existence. This is a theme that originates with Holzer's earliest 
works but which she has extended here in terms of form, language 
and imagery 

Recently the artist completed Benches, an installation 
at Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at the Sixtieth Street entrance to Cen- 
tral Park in Manhattan, one of a number of works developed for 
public sites Here Holzer contrasts two groups of four benches 
each, one of Misty Black granite inscribed with texts from Under a 
Rock, another of white Danby Royal marble inscribed with Truisms. 



The texts are incised at the monument maker's plant and the 
lighter stone pieces are sprayed with pigment to increase their 
legibility. The distinctive typeface is Government Style, developed 
by the War Department in the 1930s and still used today by the 
Veterans' Administration on all its headstones and markers. The 
benches themselves also employ a prototype in general use: they 
mimic certain kinds of park benches. Like other public sequences 
of benches placed out of doors, such as the project for Munster 
Holzer completed in the summer of 1987, and in marked contrast 
to the assertive Dia installation, Benches does not appear to 
dominate its space. Mindful of the very different audiences she 
addresses -a highly select art public at Dia, a much broader one 
with her outdoor benches-Holzer uses very different approaches. 
Thus, Benches is quietly authoritative and understated, yet has a 
compelling power. The viewer is drawn to the familiar shapes of 
the benches-they seem to be a part of the entrance to Central 
Park and to belong to the site-and is invited to sit, to read the 
inscriptions and to compare the two sets. One becomes absorbed 
in private contemplation of the texts and begins to become aware 
of the differences among the various elements, for example, the 
granite benches are smaller and contain inscriptions only on their 
top faces while the Danby Royal marble benches also display 
phrases along the sides of the top slabs. Holzer's uncanny under- 
standing of her audiences and her ability to communicate to them 
make Benches fai more potent than many other works installed 
here previously. 

Holzer's work more than holds its own in both ideal 
situations such as environments for which it has specifically been 
created and when it is seen alone, and in more uncontrolled set- 
tings like group shows. One such group exhibition was the recent 
Viewpoints Postwar Painting and Sculpture from the Guggenheim 
Museum Collection and Ma/or Loans, which took place at the 
Guggenheim in the winter of 1988-89 Here, Holzer's inscribed 
white Danby Royal marble bench, Untitled with Selections from 
Truisms (A Relaxed Man Is Not. .), 1987, had a commanding 
presence usually associated with much larger works. While it is 
difficult to account for the magnetism of this quiet, understated 
piece, one can surmise that by virtue of its shape, placement and 
inscriptions it draws the viewer in the same way that a Vermeer 
does, controlling a large surrounding space and compelling one to 
scrutinize it in detail. 

Thus Holzer's work has evolved from casual throwaway 
texts that appeared all over New York City to a sophisticated type 



12 



of commercially manufactured sign whose programs she does her- 
self and which may be accompanied by benches and sarcophagi. 
Holzer's signs, benches and sarcophagi seem permanent and 
totemic, no matter how swiftly her messages flash on and off the 
boards. The message is the medium and then some, and as Holzer 
has moved from the aphorisms and cliched ideological phrases of 
her earlier efforts to deeper meditations on modern life and the 
human condition, from the pronouncements of political figures to 
an engagement with such literary giants as Samuel Beckett she 
has found forms, in the benches and sarcophagi, that further 
enhance her writings Like the models for the messages in the 
signs, the prototypes for the benches and sarcophagi also exist in 
our culture. Unlike many of the signs, however, the benches and 
sarcophagi originate not in the vernacular of Pop culture, but at 
the very core of our society's beliefs. In juxtaposing the most 
commonplace and the most deeply rooted and meaningful aspects 
of our culture, Holzer is pointing out that culture's contradictions, 
thereby proposing a commentary on our times. 

Holzer is one of the most visible artists on the contem- 
porary scene: much of her work is by definition presented in 
public surroundings. Couched in accessible language, it seeks 
public response. Location is part of its content, as it was part of 
the content of the work of her predecessors, the Minimalists. 
Unlike much Minimalist sculpture of the sixties, however, Holzer s 
art can be both site-specific and self-sufficient, a part of a public 
arena and an entity unto itself. Therefore the viewer can experi- 
ence Holzer's work as a member of a group, on a public level, or 
interact with it in a more private, intimate way. The Minimalists 
approach was based on a rejection of many traditional aspects of 
sculpture and painting. Among their common objectives were the 
radical simplification of form, the reject.on of composition and the 
exploitation of industrial materials. Neutral geometric shapes, 
repetitive modular forms, monochromy, uninfected surfaces were 
adopted. Abstract artists like Ad Reinhardt were admired not for 
the metaphysical content of the, work but for the, strictly reduc- 
ed basic forms. It was this form, devoid of descriptive content, 
which the Minimalists placed in a controlled environment. The 
interaction between work and site was often interrupted when a 
p ,ece was removed from its specific location; sometimes it surv.ved 
in another context, often it was diminished. The Minimalists 
attention to basic structure, industrial materials, repetitive units 
and reductive form led them to produce painting and sculpture 
that was often cerebral and difficult for the viewer to comprehend. 



Because Holzer often relies on forms that are a familiar part of our 
Pop culture, her messages are more clearly articulated and more 
easily understood on a certain level of meaning. Her use of lan- 
guage is a means of engaging an audience through a shared tool, 
whereas the experience of monochrome canvases, fluorescent 
tubes or plywood boxes is often enigmatic and remains beyond 
the grasp of many spectators. Moreover, Holzer's work is more 
theatrical, more seductive, more open to emotion, broader based 
in the issues it confronts. She has therefore reached a segment of 
the public that has largely eluded the Minimalists. 

As she herself acknowledges, Holzer was influenced 
by the magazine The Fox, whose editorial board featured Joseph 
Kosuth, when she was a student at the Rhode Island School of 
Design. It is important to point out, however, that Holzer's work 
contrasts markedly with that of Kosuth Kosuth's conceptual frame- 
work is based on texts that already exist and which he isolates and 
magnifies. His art consists of the act of intervent.on exercised in 
the selection of this preexisting material and is, as Holzer notes, 
"language on language." 9 Holzer's art is of another order, because 
she makes statements that sound familiar yet are newly invented 
and tailored to the specific formats to which they are appropriate. 
As we have seen, as Holzer's meanings have grown more complex, 
her forms have changed correspondingly and her work has taken 
on a more personal dimension as well as a lyrical and ultimately 
epic tone. In these respects, her art diverges dramatically from 
that of the Conceptualists, which Sol LeWitt characterized suc- 
cinctly in a classic statement: 

In conceptual art the idea or the concept is the most 
important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a 
conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning 
and the decisions are made beforehand and the execu- 
tion is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine 
that makes the art. This kind of art is not theoretical or 
illustrative of theories, it is intuitive, it is involved with 
all types of mental processes and it is purposeless. It is 
usually free from the dependence on the skill of the 
artist as a craftsman. 10 

In theory, Holzer proceeds from a Conceptual frame of 
reference, mapping out her pieces and having them executed in 
the manner that LeWitt describes. Yet her work does not conform 
strictly to these standards. It does, however, bear close affinities to 
that of Bruce Nauman. Nauman synthesizes M.n.mal.st and 



13 



Conceptualist attitudes but infuses his art with a distinctive indi- 
vidualism that sets it apart from either aesthetic. Holzer shares 
with Nauman these characteristics as well as a laconic style, a 
black sense of humor, an acute awareness of the absurd and a 
willingness to tackle such compelling subjects as sex, violence and 
death. Both take advantage of ready-made forms and language, 
but where Nauman portrays himself in his work, Holzer focuses 
chiefly on language as image rather than on imagery per se. 
And whereas Nauman's work remains more clearly within the 
Minimalist and Conceptualist canons he was instrumental in 
defining, Holzer, a younger artist, has formed her own critical 
vocabulary of language and signs and uses a public rather than 
private forum as a means to convey her concerns. 

In working with language, Holzer is heir to a twentieth- 
century artistic tradition that began with Cubist collage and has 
figured prominently in many of the major movements of our time. 
Language has been used to refer to the real world, exploited for 
its potential as pure form, and in a dialogue with images by 
Cubists, Futurists, Dadaists and Surrealists, and in the works of 
many of the Abstract Expressionists and Pop artists, the language 
of signs has replaced the language of images among the Concep- 
tualists, thus rendering the visible world invisible. 

At the Dia space, Holzer brought the language of signs 
to a new and resonant conclusion. The heroic and noble Dia 
installation embodied qualities of the more ambitious American 
painting of the 1950s, even as it retained some of the worldliness 
of Pop Art together with aspects of Minimalist and Conceptualist 
attitudes. As her language continues to expand, Holzer's focus is 
shifting gradually from the literal meaning of the sign to the magic 
of its making. The chapel-like mood and attendant religious aura 
that the Dia installation evokes bring to mind comparisons with 
the paintings of Mark Rothko. Although Holzer does not emulate 
Rothko's color or forms, her signs emit an enveloping, atmospheric 
color, and she has developed her own basic language that, in its 
emotive power and simplicity, recalls Rothko's own. Although her 
work embraces irony and humor, she, like Rothko-or Newman, 
whose art hers also resembles in its formal clarity, scale and 
grandeur-touches upon the metaphysical dimensions of life. Her 
language extends beyond the tangible, the here and the now, and 
reaches into the abyss

INTERVIEW 

Jenny Holzer and Diane Waldman 
June 6 and July 12, 1989 



DW: You mentioned to me that at the Rhode Island 
School of Design you were doing canvases with writing 
on them. Is that how you began writing? How did you 
begin doing public projects? 

JH: When I started at RISD, I was an abstract painter 
But when I was in graduate school there, I became interested in 
having identifiable subject-matter, and I didn't want to paint it. I 
wanted to get content in there, something different than the con- 
tent of abstract art. I eventually tried writing bits of found infor- 
mation on the canvases. And at the same time, I began working 
on public projects. I left pieces of my paintings around for people 
to come across. These were for the most part unsatisfactory ex- 
periments because what I left was basically meaningless to the 
people who found them. The one encouraging thing about it was 
that I knew it was theoretically possible to leave things for people 
and you could actually stop them in their tracks. If you could ever 
figure out what was going to be of interest to them, people were 
willing and able to study or enjoy or worry or fight over what you 
left there. 

DW: Was there an intent on your part to reach a mass 
audience, as against, say, a RISD audience? 
JH: I wanted to see if I could make anything that would 
be of use to or have some kind of meaning for a very general audi- 
ence, somebody on their way to lunch who didn't care anything 
about art. I didn't manage that at RISD, but that was what I tried 
to do and I suppose that went hand-in-hand with needing to come 
up with the proper subject-matter. If you want to reach a gen- 
eral audience, it's not art issues that are going to compel them to 
stop on their way to lunch, it has to be life issues. 

DW: Did these ideas take more concrete shape as a 
result of your enrollment in the Whitney Program, or 
just from your move to New York? 
JH: Both. My thinking became sharper from the shock 
of moving to New York where it was clear that if you were going 



to present something to people, it better be just right, it better be 
about something genuinely interesting because otherwise people 
weren't going to give it a second glance. It was a combination of 
getting some kind of feel for the environment in New York and 
receiving help from the staff at the Whitney, who gave me a won- 
derful, very far-flung reading list-great books of Western knowl- 
edge. This confirmed my suspicion that the world is the subject for 
art, or at least for my art. 

DW: What in particular triggers your writing? 
JH: A combination of reading and events in the world 
and whatever is going on with my life. 

DW: What kind of writing interests you? I think your 
writing has a directness that is in some ways specifically 
American. 

JH: I have always admired two kinds of writing. One, 
delirious, flaming, emotional writing and two, completely pure, 
pared down, essential writing. I like writing that has two gears, 
that moves in a certain way and then breaks out and goes some- 
place else. 

DW: The two polarities you are talking about-in a 
way you are doing that with your work, in terms not 
only of the writing but also of the outdoor context and 
indoor context, the changes in size-small pieces, large 
pieces-public pieces, private pieces, randomness and 
control. Can we discuss the elements of randomness 
and control in your work? 

JH: I try not to make it completely random or sloppy, 
but there still has to be a wild part in it. In the writing you have to 
go off into the stratosphere and then come back down. That's 
what I like, when things spin out of control but then are pulled 
back so that they're available to you. I want them to be accessible, 
but not so easy that you throw them away after a second or two 
DW: I think you are capturing what both life and art 



are about-randomness, order, being in control, being 
out of control . both life and art have these dimen- 
sions. 

JH: I don't want total control and I don't want com- 
plete chaos. I like them both. But not averaged, both there in their 
extreme form. 

DW: Was it after you started the Whitney Program 
that you began doing the posters? 

JH: I started writing the Truisms when I was still at 
school at the Whitney, and I was in the program when I printed 
the first poster. 

DW: After you did the Truisms, how did you develop 
the concept for the Inflammatory Essays? 

JH: I remember that I thought the tone of the Truisms 
was possibly too even, too bland, too balanced. I wanted less 
balance and I wanted the next things to really flame. Then I tried 
to figure out what kind of form would be uneasy and hot and I 
went to the manifesto I'm being kind of flip saying unbalanced 
and flaming- 1 also wanted a passionate exposition of the way the 
world could be if people did things right. I wanted to move 
between, or include both sides of manifesto-making, one being 
the scary side where it's an inflamed rant to no good end, and 
then the positive side, when it's the most deeply felt description of 
how the world should be. And then I went to the library to find 
examples of the lunatic ones and the beautiful ones. 

DW: Did you feel that the subject matter of the 
Inflammatory Essays lent itself to a larger number of 
words than in the Truisms? 

JH: Sure, it's hard to rant in one sentence, I needed to 
have at least a paragraph. Also at that stage I was a little bored 
with writing one-liners and I thought it would be interesting to 
expand a bit. So I went to my natural limit of one paragraph. 

DW: Why did you begin to use the electronic signs? 

JH: I started using them because I thought the posters 
had underground or alternative connotations and I thought the 
signs were the official voice of everything from advertising to 
public service announcements. Plus they're of the world. Also, on 
the most basic level, it's a good format for conveying writing. 



That's why they're used for news blurbs, for short bursts of infor- 
mation. Plus I'm attracted to the way they look. They're modern 
and they appeal to me the same way they do to a lot of people. 
They flash and have nice colors and all that stuff 

DW: It's difficult now to disassociate any sign from 
yours. So I have a hard time when I walk around in 
New York, trying to figure out whether you've written 
this sign or not. It reverses the way you think about 
something that is in the real world. I would assume 
that you like this aspect of it? 

JH: I like that kind of confusion. I also like when my 
material literally is mixed in with advertisements or pronounce- 
ments of some sort or another. That lends a certain weight to my 
things, makes them part of the real mix of life. It also creates some 
very funny juxtapositions. 

DW: Were the works in The Living Series done as 
aluminum or bronze plaques and then as electronic 
signs? 

JH: Actually the very first ones I did were hand-lettered 
metal signs, the kind that sign painters make, saying "This Way to 
Fire Escape" that typically are red or black letters on a white enamel 
surface. Then soon after, I made the cast bronze plaques, and finally 
the writing appeared on the signs. 

DW: At this time were you reading anything different 
from what we talked about in terms of the earlier 
series? 

JH: I didn't go to the library for The Living Series be- 
cause I wanted to change the way of working and the tone. For 
The Living Series I went back to a moderate, average voice and 
language because I thought that would match the subject, which 
was everyday events that just happened to have some kind of 
kink in them. The writing described these events and then offered 
some sociopolitical observations or absurdities. 

DW: Was The Survival Series done only on the L.E.D. 
and UNEX boards? 

JH: The Survival Series was mostly done for the 
electric signs but I also made aluminum plaques for it. Since the 
language was flat, dull aluminum seemed like the right kind of 
material. 



16 



DW: You primarily used bronze in The Living Series- 
why do you distinguish between aluminum and 
bronze? Is it only because aluminum has that flatness? 

JH: I did this to separate the series from each other 
and to make it easier to recognize each one. That's why I changed 
from bronze plaques in The Living Series, which have a serif type- 
face, to the aluminum plaques, which have a sans serif contempo- 
rary face. The contemporary face matched aluminum which is a 
more modern material. Plus the subject of survival seemed like a 
modern preoccupation. 

DW: What does the title Under a Rock connote? 

JH: It refers to my bringing up some unmentionable 
or at least unpleasant topics-things that crawl out from under a 
rock. It is something like what I did in the Inflammatory Essays. 

DW: Can you tell us about any literary influences or 
any reading that you did in particular for Under a Rock? 

JH: There was nothing specific for this series. In a way, 
for Under a Rock, I was able to combine certain elements of The 
Living Series and The Survival Series with the Inflammatory 
Essays I wanted the language to be hotter and more peculiar than 
the deadpan delivery of The Living Series and The Survival Series, 
but I didn't want the ideological ranting that was the Inflammatory 
Essays I decided to write about the consequences of politics. 
Hence people throwing bod.es in the river, mothers running from 
war and terror-man-made catastrophes. What actually happens 
to peoples' lives as a result of unnecessary disasters is the theme 
of Under a Rock, rather than the mouthy stuff of the Inflammatory 
Essays which was, "We must overcome." Under a Rock is what 
occurs after people have overcome or have been overcome. 

DW: Samuel Beckett as well as Edgar Lee Masters's 
Spoon River Anthology are often mentioned as possible 
inspirations for the Laments. I don't want necessarily to 
imply a direct link with these sources, but wonder if 
you will clarify any connection that may exist. 

JH- I had started the Laments and had done maybe 
half a dozen of them when my husband Mike brought Spoon 
River Anthology to me. I don't think it was a direct influence but 
it was nice to see how somebody else made dead people talk. It 
was interesting because Masters let many kinds of people speak, 



horrible people and wonderful people. Beckett is an all-purpose 
hero for me. He wasn't so much an influence for the series as 
much as an example of intelligence and skill that made me think 
it would be great to do it like he has 

DW: I also think that your own predilections are not 
unlike his, that what you're trying to say is succinct, 
it's black humor, it's ironic. 

JH: But dead serious underneath it. 

DW: I would like to ask you about your changing 
during the last few years from the use of posters or 
signs alone to signs used together with benches or 
sarcophagi. It seems to me to put you into another 
sphere. 

JH: Even when I was concentrating on the public 
projects, I was still exhibiting some residue or artifacts from these 
public events in art spaces. So I gradually came to think that since 
I am showing pieces as art, it would make sense to design some 
things specifically for indoor spaces. As I got more confidence in 
my ability to keep the public stuff alive, and I became sure of my 
ongoing interest in it, I felt I could do the art stuff and not k.ll me 
or the public work. I also wanted to be completely satisfied with 
what I put indoors, and to do that I had to think of It in the same 
way that I did the outdoor projects, which was to design some- 
thing especially for that setting. 

DW: I find that there's a certain power to those "offi- 
cial" art efforts that you don't quite get in an outdoor 
context. If you are in an outdoor context you have a 
sign that moves, that changes quickly and you also 
have a transient group of people. In an indoor context 
you have a fixed space and a body of work that was 
done for a particular purpose. I think there is a tend- 
ency to stay longer I don't know if this is because of a 
change you have consciously made in the work or if it 
results from the setting. 

JH- It's really getting to be two different things. In 
some cases, what I gam outdoors is the surpr.se that a passerby 
has from seeing something unexpected, something with my kind 
of hard content. That's lost indoors It's almost impossible to shock 
an art audience. There may be a greater chance with the outdoor 
work that you might startle people so much that you have some 



hope of changing their thinking a little bit, or even prompting 
them to take some kind of action. You might have an incrementally 
better chance of altering something in the world with the public 
stuff just because you reach more people, and because the con- 
tent of the writing is taken at face value, it is not dismissed as art. 
However, what you gain indoors is the chance to develop a com- 
plex presentation of a lot of ideas. The installation that you set 
up can be more complex, the writing can be more complicated, 
the ideas can be more elaborated, the emotional tone can be 
richer, you can have more layers. The "art" might be better. I'm 
not even sure I mean that, often I think a stripped-down public 
thing is just as fine. I'm not sure that I have a preference I like 
to do both. 

DW: It is also conceivable to me that you can take 
some of the content of an indoor piece and make it 
work in the outdoors. 

JH: Oh yes 1 They're not mutually exclusive, although 
they're starting to be more separate than they were. It used to be 
that the exact same stuff would live in both places. 

DW: In the work with the sarcophagi you're using an 
idiom that is difficult because of its meanings for even 
the most knowledgeable person to take into his or her 
home. 

JH: I hope the sarcophagi are difficult and shocking 
too. When you're working in an art space it's hard to create the 
surprise that you get when you encounter things on the street, 
so a "difficult" form is useful in a way. Death is a hard subject. 

DW: The benches and sarcophagi have a lot of power. 
Do you find that certain forms are more effective than 
others, regardless of size? 

JH: Sometimes I use neutral forms and other times I 
want loaded forms like sarcophagi. But it has to do with trying to 
find out what topics actually mean something to people. If you 
can find the subject and then find a form that's appropriate, that is 
functional, that doesn't interfere with the subject, which is nice in 
and of itself, then you are home free. That's what I aspire to. I try 
to get the subject and present it in the correct way and on the 
right thing; I try to find a home for it, and then I put it where 
someone is going to see it Even with the street posters, even the 
Inflammatory Essays, I wanted them to be nice in their own 



horrible way, they had to have form. It was important that they 
were ordered, and I wanted the typeface to be italic and bold and 
just so, and to have bright colors and to be pure squares so that 
people would want to come up to them. It's just taking care. 

DW: And seduction. 

JH: And seduction. Careful seduction. 

DW: Seduction and order, it's a wonderful combination 
Do you get any special reactions to your work from 
women? 

JH: I've noticed some particular responses from women, 
although I don't always do womens' issues per se. Women are 
very concerned about the nuts and bolts of survival. Women often 
feel a little more threatened, a little more aware than men, or 
a little sadder about realities or possible consequences. Maybe 
that's a general reason why some of my subjects might resonate 
with women. Another reason is that women are very practical 
about things because they have to be, and my approach is practical 
and explicit. 

DW: I think that the work has a directness and clarity 
to it, whether it's the shape or the writing. 

JH: Both hopefully. I think women appreciate function. 

DW: Should we talk about the piece you are doing for 
the Guggenheim? Can you tell us what you have seen 
in the space, which is very organic in nature, and how 
you envision it will be in contrast to the space at Dia, 
which was fairly regular and much more enclosed? Do 
you see the Museum's shape as leading you to some- 
thing different from the way you are working? 

JH: It's an intriguing proposition at the Museum. This is 
definitely a place where you don't ignore the shape or the volume 
of the space. I thought for a long time that it would be incredible 
to do something with it, not against it, not for it, just with it. So I 
tried to come up with a piece that would be a part of it but that 
would add something. It has to be somewhere between autono- 
mous and respectful. I think going around and around the parapet 
wall with a sign will do that because it will have a life of its own 
but certainly will give more than a nod to the space. I hope the 
piece won't be overcome by the architecture or ruin it. I think it 
will be a logical shape within the space. We will be able to get the 



18 



information from the spiral sign standing below, on the Rotunda 
floor, or across the space from a ramp, so it should pass the test of 
being functional, and with good programming it should be appeal- 
ing, too. It must be engaging somehow, physically and emotion- 
ally. It should look relatively clean. It shouldn't be excessive. 

DW: This is fascinating because the central space is so 
much a part of the volume of the place, yet it hasn't 
been used before. Even sculptors who have looked at 
the space and made pieces specifically for it have really 
used only the Rotunda floor. They haven't considered 
the parapet which ties the whole place together from 
the dome to the main floor. 

JH: The ramp with its parapet wall is where you get up 
and down, where you travel from top to bottom. It's a nice band, 
a nice ribbon. As well as being such a strong visual element, you 
walk inside the shell here, so it seemed that was the place to go. 
What I would like to do, if the sign guys and I can manage it, is 
to have periods of calm in the sign's programming, texts spiraling 
slowly. That will be the dominant mode because it will be like 
water flowing to the top, going round and round. But then I 
would like to break the pattern sometimes and have texts go 
to the center, flash and twist and be stationary and then continue. 

DW: The piece at Dia has some of that 

JH: Yes, it's funny, it's only after you stare at a space a 
long time that you figure out what it requires. At Dia, I'd done all 
the programming in advance and each sign was going to act 
independently of the other. I'd done all-out special effects, with 
each sign going crazy constantly. Then when I got to the room, I 
realized because of the subject matter of the piece that the setting 
should be very quiet; that it was best if there were, for the most 
part, a very steady, slow rising text on each sign, and if the signs 
at some point synchronized. That they should play one by one, 
and stop when they finished their individual program, and then go 
to dark. And when the last one had stopped, they would all come 
on again simultaneously so there would be a little optimism. But 
this came clear only three days before the show opened. I imagine 
that I'll do last minute changes at the Guggenheim, too. 

DW: Will there be a particular theme for the writing in 
the Guggenheim piece? Will it be a statement about 
yourself, about museums, about art? Will it reflect a 



particular response to the setting in comparison to your 
response to Dia? 

JH: Using an expanse of parapet wall lets me not just 
have a nice shape but gives me a long billboard on which I can 
display a lot of material. I'll go back into the older series all the 
way up through whatever I'm doing by December of this year, 
and pick and choose. I'll have various series spiraling up the ramp 
at different times. Dia was one particular subject done in depth. 
This new installation will be more across-the-board, which I think 
will be suitable for a museum audience. The writing won't be 
about art and museums, and it won't be about me, at least directly. 

DW: I have read that a cross-section of your work will 
be shown in Venice. I know that you haven't come to 
any decisions about Venice, but I wonder if you can 
discuss what you are thinking about for the Biennale? 

JH: I'm thinking that an indoor sign and various public 
projects outside the American Pavilion might be a good place for a 
retrospective or selection of earlier work. Inside the Pavilion I may 
do something new about freedom I thought I might split it into 
two parts, freedom from and freedom to. Have the dark wing 
freedom from all the things that you don't want to happen, and 
then the positive side would be freedom to do what is important 
and necessary. I have some ideas about the installation. I like the 
delicate lines, the fine lines of color in Venetian glass. So I might 
make tiny bands of light in some of the galleries with LED. signs. 
In one space I would have horizontals wrapping the room so that 
there would be several bands all around, and then have skinny 
vertical signs in another room. You will completely lose the space; 
there will just be these slender bands of light. I also was consider- 
ing redoing the floors, rather than having a lot of stone objects, I 
would just lay the stone on the floor and have inscriptions there. 
The materials would then melt away

THE LIVING SERIES 



60 



IT TAKES A WHILE BEFORE YOU CAN STEP OVER INERT BODIES 
AND GO AHEAD WITH WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO. 



IT CAN BE STARTLING TO SEE SOMEONE'S BREATH, LET 

ALONE THE BREATHING OF A CROWD. YOU USUALLY DON'T 

BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE EXTEND THAT FAR. 

THERE'S THE SENSATION OF A LOT OF FLESH WHEN EVERY 

SINGLE HAIR STANDS UP. THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE 

COLD AND NAKED, AROUSED, OR SIMPLY TERRIFIED. 



YOU SHOULD LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU ACT 

AGAINST YOUR NATURE, LIKE SLEEPING WITH PEOPLE YOU 

HATE IT'S INTERESTING TO TEST YOUR CAPABILITIES FOR A 

WHILE BUT TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE DAMAGE. 

THE MOUTH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE 
PLACES WHERE THE DRY OUTSIDE MOVES TOWARD THE 

SLIPPERY INSIDE. 

ANY NUMBER OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS LIE FACE DOWN ON THE 

BEdTnE &gt; WORK ON ENERGY, HOUSING, LABOR, JUSTICE, 

EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, AGRICULTURE, 

AND BALANCE OF TRADE. 



SOME DAYS YOU WAKE AND IMMEDIATELY ^ i START TO vV ORRY . 



SUSPICION THAT FORCES ARE ALIGNING QUIETLY AND 
THERE WILL BE TROUBLE.

IY DOGS RUN WILD IN THE CITY. SOME 

ARE ABANDONED BY THEIR OWNERS AND 
OTHERS ARE BORN TO LOST DOGS. STRAYS 
HAVE A LIMITED LIFE EXPECTANCY EVEN 
WHEN THEY BAND TOGETHER IN PACKS. THEY 
ARE PREY TO DISEASE. PARASITES. WEATHER.

THE SURVIVAL SERIES

YOU ARE TRAPPED ON THE EARTH 
SO YOU WILL EXPLODE 



SPIT ALL OVER SOMEONE WITH A MOUTHFUL 

OF MILK IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT 
SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR PERSONALITY FAST 

DIE FAST AND QUIET WHEN THEY INTERROGATE 

YOU OR LIVE SO LONG THAT 
THEY ARE ASHAMED TO HURT YOU ANYMORE 

IN A DREAM YOU SAW A WAY TO SURVIVE 
AND YOU WERE FULL OF JOY 

WHEN YOU EXPECT FAIR PLAY YOU CREATE AN 
INFECTIOUS BUBBLE OF MADNESS AROUND YOU 

USE WHAT IS DOMINANT IN A CULTURE 
TO CHANGE IT QUICKLY 

GO WHERE PEOPLE SLEEP AND 
SEE IF THEY'RE SAFE 

MEN DON'T PROTECT YOU ANYMORE 

BODIES LIE IN THE BRIGHT GRASS AND SOME 
ARE MURDERED AND SOME ARE PICKNICKING 

THE BEGINNING OFTHE WAR WILL BE SECRET 

THE BREAKDOWN COMES WHEN YOU STOP 

CONTROLLING YOURSELF AND WANT 

THE RELEASE OF A BLOODBATH

CRACKTHE PELVIS SO SHE LIES RIGHT. THIS IS 
A MISTAKE. WHEN SHE DIES YOU CANNOT REPEAT 
THE ACT. THE BONES WILL NOT GROW TOGETHER

BACK. SHE IS GOING TO SINK DEEP INTO THE 
MOSS TO GET WHITE AND LIGHTER. SHE IS 
UNRESPONSIVE TO BEGGING AND SELF-ABSORBED 

PEOPLE GO TO THE RIVER WHERE IT IS LUSH AND 
MUDDYTO SHOOT CAPTIVES, TO FLOAT OR SINK 
THEM. SHOTS KILL MEN WHO ALWAYS WANT. 
SOMEONE IMAGINED OR SAWTHEM LEAPING

OR MAKING THEM FURIOUS.

I WANT TO LIVE IN 

A SILVER WRAPPER. 

I WILL SEE 

WHOOPING ROCKS FLY. 

I WILL ICE ON MY BLACK SIDE 

AND STEAM ON MY OTHER 

WHEN I FLOAT BY SUNS. 

I WANT TO LICK FOOD 

FROM THE CEILING. 

I AM AFRAID TO STAY 

ON THE EARTH. 

FATHER HAS CARRIED ME THIS 

FAR ONLY TO HAVE ME BURN 

AT THE EDGE OF SPACE. 
FACTS STAY IN YOUR MIND 

UNTIL THEY RUIN IT. 

THE TRUTH IS PEOPLE ARE 

PUSHED AROUND BY TWO MEN 

WHO MOVE ALL THE 

BODIES ON EARTH INTO 

PATTERNS THAT PLEASE THEM. 

THE PATTERNS SPELL 

OH NO NO NO 

BUT IT DOES NO GOOD 

TO WRITE SYMBOLS. 

YOU HAVE TO DO THE 

RIGHT ACTS WITH YOUR BODY. 

I SEE SPACE AND IT 

LOOKS LIKE NOTHING AND 

I WANT IT AROUND ME.
