PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 



The trauma and the devastations of World War II that visited the 
embattled European continent required complex adjustments in the 
creative realm. While American painting, benefiting from a wave of 
European emigration, experienced a marked invigoration, artists in 
Europe were only gradually moving from destruction and occupation to 
an uncertain peace. France, nonetheless, was expected to continue 
leadership in the realm of high art. 

Such expectations were fulfilled in part by the surviving Parisian demi- 
gods who continued to be influential, as well as by an emerging gen- 
eration of abstract painters nourished and encouraged by the rich 
traditions of European modernism. But opposing tendencies, which 
seemed radical and unaccommodating at the time, surfaced in short 
order. Among these, the examples set by Jean Dubuffet in France and 
by the Cobra artists in Denmark, Belgium and The Netherlands were 
the most conspicuous. Pierre Alechinsky, surely one of the youngest 
participants in the shortlived but influential Cobra movement, was even 
then recognizable as standard bearer for the Belgians, marked as he was 
by extraordinary talent and early achievement. 
Cobra has long since been recognized as a meaningful chapter in the 
history of modern art, and while, happily, a few of its original adherents 
are still working vigorously, many others have left the scene. Pierre 
Alechinsky today is, by general consensus, the most distinguished 
among those who, having outlived Cobra, continue to assert valid and 
emphatic contemporary leadership. Presenting Alechinsky at the height 
of his powers, this exhibition thus becomes an acknowledgment of the 
artist's stature and achievement. Although it deliberately eschews the 
conventional retrospective format, it nevertheless takes in a broad range 
of work. 

The exhibition theme, Margin and Center, was formulated during ex- 
tensive conversations that preceded selection, as we became aware of 
the pervasive formal and iconographic presence of the two components 
that comprise the exhibition's title. But in focusing upon it one should 



bear in mind that this conspicuous device applies only to a small frac- 
tion of the artist's total oeuvre and therefore appears magnified by its 
isolation. 

The contributors to the present catalogue, Michael Gibson and Octavio 
Paz, as well as Pierre Alechinsky himself, to all of whom we express our 
appreciation, have found words that allow the theme of the exhibition 
to reach beyond its visual dimension. We acknowledge as well the par- 
ticipation of Guggenheim Museum staff members on the project. The 
artist's closest collaborator was Lisa Dennison, the Guggenheim's As- 
sistant Curator, who was instrumental in selecting the exhibition and 
deserves credit for staging it. The editing of the catalogue was the re- 
sponsibility of Carol Fuerstein, Editor. Nina Nathan Schroeder, Cura- 
torial Assistant, and Diana Murphy, Assistant Editor, were also 
involved with many aspects of the exhibition and catalogue. 

Pierre Alechinsky: Margin and Center has benefited from the financial 
support of the Commissariat General aux Relations Internationales de 
la Communaute Francaise de Belgique, Brussels, and the Association 
Francaise d'Action Artistique, Paris. We greatly value the assistance of 
these organizations. The exhibition is scheduled to tour in this country 
and abroad and will be seen after the Guggenheim's initial showing at 
the Des Moines Art Center, the Kunstverein Hannover e.V. and the 
Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Art Moderne, Brussels. 
Neither the original presentation nor the tour could have been arranged 
without the generosity of many lenders whose names appear elsewhere 
in this catalogue, unless they have requested anonymity. Our gratitude 
is herewith conveyed to all of these individuals and institutions. 
My final word of thanks is addressed to the artist, with whom I have 
maintained a long and rewarding friendship.

Central Park 



The Argument: Some say that, given the exterior world exists, one must 
deny it; others say that, given the world does not exist, one must invent 
it; and still others, that only the inner world exists. Pierre Alechinsky 
turns his head and, saying nothing, paints a rectangle in which he en- 
closes Central Park in New York, in the late afternoon, seen from the 
window of his closed eyes. The rectangle surrounds the four sides of the 
park, and is divided into irregular spaces, themselves rectangles, like the 
boxes in a theater, the cells in a convent or the cages in a zoo. Inside 
each box swarm bizarre creatures that are somehow vaguely familiar: 
Are they they or us} Do we look at them, or are they looking at us? In- 
side the rectangle, Central Park has been transformed into a green, 
black and golden Cobra: Is it an anamorphosis of Alice, the Queen of 
Diamonds in our sleepwalking deck? The painting is not a vision but a 
spell. 



Green and black thickets, bare spots, 

leafy river knotting into itself: 

it runs motionless through the leaden buildings 

and there, where light turns to doubt 

and stone wants to be shadow, it vanishes. 

Don't cross Central Park at &gt;iight. 



Day falls, night flares up, 
Alechinsky draws a magnetic rectan^ 
a trap of lines, a corral of ink: 
inside there is a fallen beast, 
two eyes and a twisting rage. 
Do;? 7 cross Central Park at night. 



There are no exits or entrances, 

enclosed in a ring of light 

the grass beast sleeps with eyes open, 

the moon exhumes razors, 

the water in the shadows has become green fire. 

Don't cross Central Park at night. 

There are no entrances but everyone, 

in the middle of a phrase dangling from the telephone, 

from the top of the fountain of silence or laughter, 

from the glass cage of the eye that watches us, 

everyone, all of us are falling in the mirror. 

Don't cross Central Park at night. 

The mirror is made of stone and the stone now is shadow, 

there are two eyes the color of anger, 

a ring of cold, a belt of blood, 

there is a wind that scatters the reflections 

of Alice, dismembered in the pond. 

Don't cross Central Park at night. 

Open your eyes: now you are inside yourself, 
you sail in a boat of monosyllables 
across the mirror-pond, you disembark 
at the Cobra dock: it is a yellow taxi 
that carries you to the land of flames 
across Central Park at night.

Pierre Alechinsky and Michael Gibson 



Bordering on Something Central 



michael GIBSON: Let's talk about your marginal com- 
ments. 

pierre alechinsky: I pass. No I don't after all. I'll trump with one of 
Henri Matisse's remarks: "I always start from the frame." 

M.G.: What do you make of that statement? 

p.a.: Beyond the frame there is . . . well, all the rest! The roving hordes, 
the outside world, so powerful when you compare it to a small rect- 
angle of paper or canvas. I sense then how urgent it is, not only to con- 
centrate on the composition of the rectangle itself, but also on that of its 
frontiers, on the margins. 

Progressively, as I produced my paintings with margins (I have been 
painting such works episodically, ever since I did Central Park in 1965 
[cat. no. 1]), I found myself stressing the rectangle, underscoring it even, 
whether by means of a fringe of pictures around the center, or by 
materializing a border. 

M.G.: You did this with the idea of defining a separate 
space in which a different order of event occurs. Right? 

p.a.: And at the same time to annex the frame, to make it part of the pic- 
ture, rather (let's say in passing) in the manner that an engraver uses a 
border in his woodcut to prevent the roller from touching areas that 
have been hollowed out. This is the sort of limitation that can turn out 
to be an aesthetic advantage — depending on the engraver's talent. I 
started out as a printer and I have made use of some of the craftsman's 
notions, tricks or habits in my painting. Marginalia — in the form of 
notes, addenda, subtitles, summaries — have existed ever since the in- 
vention of the book. Proof corrections find their proper place in the 
margin too; they indicate and countermand alongside the column of 



15 



type. Authors use the margin to modify the text on which they are 
working. It can be quite spectacular at times. Lithographers use it to test 
a tool and try their hand before setting to work. In doing so they trace 
minute and often charming preparatory sketches, which are erased be- 
fore the actual printing, once the first test print has been run off. Some 
rare proofs of this kind are occasionally to be found, described in print 
and book collector's catalogues in such terms as: "... despite a few 
rust spots, this is a fine proof of the first state with marginal com- 
ments." A term I appropriated. 

M.G.: Your own modus operandi also includes the as- 
sembling and mounting on canvas of the work you ini- 
tially painted on paper. This is at once an additional 
business of composition and a manual task. 

P. A.: Which invites a detour. It is a fortunate thing, really, that painting 
should demand such a wide range of chores. One would be rather ill-ad- 
vised to tackle literature head on! But the very act of painting requires a 
whole ritual of mcantatory approach. It is this specific mixture, three 
parts chores to one part creation, that yields a painting. 

m.g.: Let's talk about the work that stands before us: 
After Us, 1980 (cat. no. 46). 




Bougival, 1983

p.a.: The center, both mineral and aquatic, says: color. The border com- 
posed of black and white drawings confirms that the subject of the cen- 
tral part is cascades and moving vapors that fall back into water. The 
viewer's eye is led on through a giratory movement, a cycle. The subject 
dealt with in the middle of the painting was less apparent: just a deluge 
of blue .... This impelled me to add some clarifications outside the 
field. And so I painted one rectangle after another, around the big one 
in the middle, and then adding the comments within their individual 
frames, each one with its own problems of composition [After Us). 

M.G.: It might conceivably evoke the way a sixteenth- 
century tapestry is organized — or even an oriental carpet. 

p.a.: The image in itself is isolated and forsaken, therefore vulnerable. 
From time to time it requires protection. The access border, the com- 
mentaries reassure. The painting must stand alone in its struggle against 
indifference. The viewer is soon enough inclined to turn his eyes to 
other sights! The image is not always self-sufficient. It needs a specific 
body of reference to catch and hold the passing glance. 

M.G.: All this work of composition prompts the eye to 
come and go. 

p.a.: From the larger to the smaller. These paintings are intended to be 
seen in two ways — both from a distance and close-up. Just as I made 
them: first the center, then the margins. 

M.G.: First the center, yes. I suppose you allow yourself a 
pause between the two? 

P.A.: Once the center is done I grant myself a moment of respite. I float 
around or turn to other tasks; the break can last several days, after 
which I begin working on the border; but it can also last several weeks 
or months. In exceptional cases, even several years. No schedule, no 
deadline. No obligation either. Agoraphobia Square (cat. no. zo) (a 
painting, done in 1966, that gives a good idea of where I stood after the 
twenty years I had remained faithfully wedded to oil painting) waited 
for three years before receiving, in acrylic at last, the developments on 
its frame. In any event, I observe the center before venturing into the 
margins. But, as you know, I have also painted and I still paint a lot of 
images without- marginalia. Evidently they are not a necessity each and 
every time.

M.G.: What is your understanding of the notion of 
"spontaneity" which played such an important role in 
the theories of the Cobra movement? 

P.A.: Spontaneity was the rallying cry of Cobra in contrast to the "pure 
psychic automatism" favored, no doubt with some extra charge of 
idealism, by Andre Breton. This "purity" was dismantled by Asger Jorn 
in an article published in Cobra in 1949: "Discours aux pingouins" 
("Speech to the Penguins"). Did Jorn want to convince the armless 
man? 1 

The action of painting leads the painter to an awareness of the material 
nature of his craft, much more so than a writer who is never sufficiently 
conscious of the material act of writing, of the tracing of words. This 
notion was significantly amplified by Christian Dotremont, who de- 
rived his logograms from it. 2 Marcel Havrenne' spoke of a poetry "in 
which the script itself has its word to say." Both of them referred to the 
impact of the physical act of writing on the imagination. Implicit in this 
attitude is a mistrust of any idea that is too precise at the outset: it can 
blind one to new ideas that might otherwise appear while work is in 
progress. Everything significant occurs within this creative "mean- 
while" (which is one of the mysteries of art). Before is irrelevant, we are 
told. And after, we stand before a fait accompli, a definite result, defi- 
nitely locked into its own moment in time, and which we call a painting. 

M.c,.: So that, in this view, the term "spontaneity" refers 
to a form of interaction between conception and execu- 
tion, the manner in which the physical act of painting in- 
flects the actual result. It implies a readiness to welcome 
whatever may yet, quite unpredictably, occur. But I also 
notice, in actual tact, beyond the polemical slogan 
"spontaneity," a manner of paradoxical tension: on the 
one hand this openness, availability, "spontaneity," and 
on the other a demanding attitude, an order, a disci- 
pline. Spontaneity, in this sense, does not imply a sur- 
render to mere impulse .... 



1 Asger Jorn (19 14-7?). The French tirle of the article mentioned 
here hinges on a remote allusion: a variety of penguins is known as 
"manchot" (without hands) in French because their wings are reminis- 
cent of arms without hands. 

2 Christian Dotremont (1912-79). Belgian poet and artist, cofounder 
of Cobra in 1948 and inventor of the acronym (COpenhagen-BRus- 
sels-Amsterdam). For logograms, see Abrupt Fable and Seismographic 
Armful (cat. nos. 38, 93), made in collaboration with Alechinsky. 

3 Marcel Havrenne (1912-57). Belgian poet who belonged to Cobra.

Abrupt Fable, Brussels, 



pa.: The less demanding, the less visual person will indeed surrender- 
the temptation is too great. 

M.C.: And he will invoke spontaneity. 

p.a.: As an extenuating circumstance! 



M.G.: I bring this up because I gave the matter some 
thought a few years ago, after a conversation I had with 
Dotremont. It occurred to me then that there was an 
abyss between what he actually meant by spontaneity 
and the vulgar, unthinking meaning the term usually is 
given. In Dotremont's case this "spontaneity" was 
coupled with a considerable discipline. When he drew 
his logogram he never allowed the idea of the text to 
precede by any great length of time the actual act of set- 
ting it down on paper. And not only that: if the result 
did not satisfy him, he rarely made use of the same text a 
second time but went on to invent another one. His 
"spontaneity," consequently, was never devoid of self- 
discipline, and his craft was the result of an interaction 
between openness and stricture. 




Bougii 



P.A.: It's a strange thing: we create limits for ourselves. We invent a 
game called "painting," governed by disciplines which, all told, are ex- 
tremely demanding. The artist-legislator is also his own judge. He can- 
not, however, easily lie to himself, to the extent that he can only feel 
pleased or displeased by the line he has just drawn. So he has no other 
choice but to strive after a perfection that cannot exist — "perfection is 
death," said Jorn. And only in the long run can we measure the scope of 
the disciplines we have imposed upon ourselves. Discipline! An ex- 
travagant word to be coupled with such spacious freedom! 

m.g.: As for the openness or availability we mentioned, 
it is apparent in the very act by which the line is 
drawn. 

p.a.: And which the eye trails. 



M.G.: And this is why we can easily recognize a line 
drawn by Alechinsky. Your draftsman's script, like your 
handwriting, belongs to you alone. And your graphic 



idiom can also be recognized in the choice of a certain 
format, a way of "centering," of organizing the work as 
a whole. 

p.a.: This concern with composition is the result of a handicap I have. I 
am left-handed. Educators ordered me to hold my pen in my right hand, 
the awkward one, but fortunately allowed me to clutch a pencil or 
brush in my left one. Painting and drawing, as you can see, do not enjoy 
the same status as writing. I was soon aware of the flow that runs from 
right to left instead of in the direction followed by a reader's eye. Yet 
this is the direction in which a viewer surveys a painting. Consequently 
the situation, as far as I am concerned, is the following: I must allow a 
free rein to my reverse dynamics, while making allowances for a few 
features that will permit the viewer (myself included) to return to the 
cursive flow derived from the act of reading. Hence my predilection for 
the printer's shop, where I have spent so many hours looking into 
Alice's mirror where all that has been reversed is again set right. 

m.g.: So the eye runs in a set direction, not only when it 
reads a text, but also when it takes in a picture. 

p.a.: This direction is perceptible in the way the brush settles on the 
paper, rests there and leaves it. Painters discover this if they are curious 
enough to look at their painting in a mirror. On the other hand, being 
quite accustomed to seeing our own features reversed, we dislike our- 
selves in a photograph. A photograph is shocking to its subject. 

m.g.: Have you, in any way, taken advantage of your 
handicap? 

P.A.: I would never have been so attentive to composition if I had the 
blinding good fortune of being right-handed! 

My own adventures with writing have made me aware of script in gen- 
eral. I often view a painting as a mass of information. I discover the 
hand and personality, hesitant or determined, sensitive or dreary, pre- 
tentious, measured, captivating, precise, brutal, compassionate, refined, 
open, flustered, sovereign, adorable, etc. All that, and much more be- 
sides, is to be read in the lines of a painting. 



m.g.: Do you perceive an affinity between your artistic 
script and the Far Eastern technique of calligraphy? 

pa.: Our perception of Far Eastern script doesn't go beyond its graphic 
aspect. We don't understand what it is saying. But we discover a com- 
parable graphic serpentine (our own manner of tying and untying a 
line), if we take the trouble of holding a page we have written to the 
light, and looking at it from behind, reversed, so that we can no longer 
make out the written text. I sometimes write backwards with my left 
hand. In 1955 1 traveled to Japan to study the calligraphers and film 
them at work on sheets of paper laid out on the floor or placed flat on a 
low table. In any event, I have chosen to use the same equipment and 
have acquired a passionate love for paper. 

But the precepts of a master must necessarily be disappointing. "What 
should one do to become a great calligrapher?" And the immediate an- 
swer is: "Sit upright and breathe properly." And Bonnard too, advising 
a young painter, says no more than: "Always have a clean rag." 

A calligrapher or a writer can get a kind of satisfaction from tracing an 
entire sentence or text at one go. Their state of mind is different from 
that of a painter who traces a form here or there on his canvas, then 
stands back to judge the effect before continuing. The calligrapher does 
not pause. He writes cursively and appreciates the formal beauty arising 
out of his tool, his paper, the movement of his hand inflected by the 
literary content. A painter does not transmit words; his drawings have 
no connection with syntax. 

M.G.: Have you noticed a change in your script as time 
goes on? 

P.A.: Indeed, a hand armed with a brush acquires practice, encounters 
surprises and improves with time. A line that expresses at once the art- 
ist's idea, his moments of hesitation, the shortcuts of his thoughts and 
of his decisions, his energy with its phases of acceleration and of subsid- 
ing pleases me more than any exaggeratedly neutral one. 

M.G.: And all of this is apparent before us, here in a 
broken line, or there in the hatchmarks that define a 
frame. 

P.A.: In vital chaffings, pauses, wrenches that are, one must hope, per- 
ceptible, in the imprint of the brush that reveals the power of a forceful 
gesture or the delicacy of a caress. 



m.g.: What sort of brushes do you use? 

pa.: Preferably goat hair mounted on bamboo. Wolf fur too. Though 
the so-called wolf may well be no more than some unfortunate dog! 
"Wolf" naturally sounds more impressive. In any event the manufactur- 
ers of Far Eastern brushes claim that they are made of the hairs of this 
noble and dangerous creature. 



m.g.: Looking at such works as Chromatic Buoy (cat. 
no. 75), based on the rubbing of a circular bench, or 
Street Pepper (cat. no. 81), based on rubbings of a cast- 
iron manhole cover, a question comes to mind: Just 
what kind of interest do you take in the symbolic value 
of, say, the circle or the wheel? 

p. A. : A painting can evoke different associations each time we look at 
it — and consequently different ideas. Dotremont said: "A painting is a 
ventriloquist's doll." This leads us to the literary problem of choosing 
titles. 

When it comes to thinking up a title, the general impression, a detail, 
some circumstance unrelated to pictorial matters can provide a clue. 
Each unknown painting must provoke its own title. This explains why 
the "entitling painter" has almost more experience than a writer. 1 have 
had to find titles for several dozen drawings at a go. "Be more specific, 
please," says the title to the painter. 

I have published several books with the word "title" on the cover. The 
matter obviously preoccupies me. I wrote Titres et pains perdus in 
1965; then Le test du titre, in which I published the responses of sixty- 
one personalities I had asked to think up titles for six of my drawings. 
And finally Le bureau du titre, a sequence of titles presented without 
any corresponding pictures, so that they might be savored on their own. 
As for my titreurs d'elite, 4 many of whom are now dead (Rene Magritte, 
Jean Paulhan, Francois Truffaut . . . and so recently Joyce Mansour), 
most of them, quite independently of one another, had found some sort 
of common denominator. Much to my surprise! 



4. This untranslatable pun combines the notion of tireur d'elite, a 
sharpshooter, and titreur, a term coined by Alechinsky to signify a per- 
son who finds a title for a painting. A titreur d'elite is consequently an 
expert at inventing titles. 



M.( , My question about symbolic or mythic content 
was prompted by the fact that you quite recently chose 
to produce a series of paintings dealing with circular 
forms. 

pa.: I've been involved with wheels for a long time, and making rub- 
bings of them too. I even wrote a book entitled Roue libre for Albert 
Skira in 1969. At that time I had not yet noticed the cast-iron manhole 
covers in the streets, but I had painted Star and Disaster (cat. no. 19) 
based on a pattern of concentric circles. 

M.G.: As far as content is concerned, there are obviously 
... 1 was about to say, "universal symbols." When 
someone draws a circle he brings about, how shall 1 put 
it, a sort of . . . 

p. a.: Statement. 

M.G.: I was thinking more of a state of mind. We collect 

ourselves, our thoughts or feelings, inside a circle with a 

certain degree of fascination. Stage directors are aware 

of this and make good use of the inclination. So there is Bou S lva1 ' I9 , 7 ^ w ' th P 01 " 

, /- 1 ■ 11 1 traits or Mickv and lorn 

some irony in the act 01 taking manhole covers and turn- 
ing them into mandalas. 

P.A.: Derision, yes, but marked with a touch of admiration. A distortion 
of derision. My admiration for the anonymous work of the foundrymen 
has its share in this. I have been attentive to the variety of decorative 
motives on these cast-iron plates which the French administration refers 
to as "pieces du mobilier urbaui." This leads me back to recollections of 
childhood (rubbing a com with a pencil) or to Max Ernst (Max, that 
lucid child). They are technically rubbings. As it happens, they are also 
evocative both of childhood and of China. 

Is it so unusual to pay attention to these covers shaped like mandalas? A 
man walking, Jean Dubuffet once observed, is more inclined to look at 
the ground than straight ahead. Gravity plays its part. I took those ex- 
tremely heavy plates that communicate with the catacombs of New 
York, out of whose infernal depths gray fumaroles arise, and turned 
them into solar wheels: suspended gates of hell! 

Other enigmatic forms have come to squat in my paintings. "Universal 
symbols" I am sometimes told, that also occur in sacred art. But in fact, 
my own art is profane. I am an atheist, and insistent upon this fact, 




though I do feel an affinity for such things, and am always stirred, for 
instance, by Johann Sebastian Bach's Saint Matthew Passion — stirred, 
but without hope. And hopelessly so. 

M.G.: You keep your distance from content. 

p.a.: It's more a matter of reserve. 

M.G.: Of irony, perhaps, masking a modesty which in 
turn masks a content? 



P.A.: Long ago I elaborated a vocabulary made of images. I drew from 
things laid out on my table next to the paper and the ink bottle — ex- 
ceedingly humble things (if you will forgive the pathetic fallacy, of at- 
tributing an attitude such as modesty to pebbles, roots and orange 
peels). And then, emerging from them, like sequences of free associa- 
tions or like puns, I saw all my lady-loves appear, and also the feathered 
headgear of the Gilles dancers of the Carnaval de Binche (suddenly so 
close to those of -the Mayas), and volcanic eruptions, spirals, volutes, 
the meanders of a river turning into a lane, a shoelace, a necessary 
snake. 



M.G.: About this matter of content, I would rather say 
that we are dealing with a symbolic material inherent in 
society itself, of which a highly elaborate and formalized 
version is found in the various religions. But this fund of 
images is already present in the language we are taught, 
in education and even in good manners. This thing we 
call "culture" is a free and creative elaboration, by all 
human societies, of a fund inherited from the animal 
societies from which we are descended. (I have no use 
for sociobiology, by the way, which Marshall Sahlins 
has devastatingly criticized.) These societies also have 
their symbolic order, as any ethologist can tell, rooted in 
behavior. No society can function without it, but in our 
own case it assumes much vaster proportions because it 
takes the shape of a symbolic language which refers to 
the meaning and value of all things. 
This aspect can easily be neglected, no doubt because 
our way of describing the world has favored the indi- 
vidual self-perception, taking it in isolation and artifi- 
cially placing it under glass. As Gavroche might have 
said, it is, in a sense, la faute a Descartes — for Descartes 
(but Locke too), based his philosophy on individual self- 
awareness and thus sent into eclipse those aspects of this 
awareness which arose out of the prehuman collectivity, 
although they are, in fact, quite as fundamental as the 
individual aspect. This has always been so, of course, 
because we inherited this social ground, with its basic 
behavioral symbolism (which has been studied by Kon- 
rad Lorenz, among others) from our prehuman ances- 
tors. We inherited it as a basic pattern, but we also 
elaborated it (and continue to elaborate it) in a way that 
allows us to designate goals and values beyond the im- 
mediate and tangible ones that alone concern animal 
societies. And it is primarily this ordering of a society 
and its goals (inevitably through symbolic terms) that 
constitutes the material of culture. . . . 

The collective order of culture has its inhuman aspect 
because it often commands a blindly tribal assent, but it 
is also that which, in an entirely positive sense, goes 
beyond the individual and represents the things for 
which the individual is willing to give all of himself, and 
even his life if necessary. It consequently commands 
both the most immoral and the most ethical forms of be- 
havior. In the latter case, it refers us to the values that 
give life a substantiality and a meaning. And all of these 




z6 



can ultimately be condensed into, and signified by an en- 
tirely rudimentary symbol, a circle, for instance. It is far 
too easy to treat such things as though they were mere 
speculative theory. Yet when someone draws a circle be- 
fore us, under certain (theatrical or religious) cir- 
cumstances, it can call to mind something that has a 
bearing on a community or a communion — or again, 
with negative implications, a casting of spells, a separa- 
tion or, in a better sense yet, a reserved space, a "pas- 
sage" towards transcendence, in other words towards 
"what is not there" or "not yet there," though it is of 
momentous importance to us: our life goal. And when a 
person deals with forms, as you do, he is constantly 
making use of such things, be it a circle, or a sequence of 
images that suggest a narrative, even if the narrative, as 
it happens in your work, has no definable content. 

PA.: I was recently showing a friend some paintings composed of rub- 
bings, Chromatic Buoy among them. And he declared that the trace of 
these cast-iron entities appeared more important than the objects them- 
selves, in the same way the hollow imprint of a vanished fossil becomes 
more affecting than the actual fossil. The fossil is gone, the trace re- 
mains. The negative concept is more intense than the positive one. 
Whereupon he began to talk about Tantrism. I replied that as soon as 
we see a circle anywhere Tantrism will inevitably be mentioned. 

Yet walking through the flea-market years ago I had, despite my own 
fathomless unknowing, been drawn to a Tantric image which I found so 
beautiful that I carried it home with me. Had it been hanging on my 
studio wall for so long that I no longer could see it? When people recog- 
nize "universal symbols" in my work I sometimes recoil, as though the 
association were undeserved. A reflex. As if to say: "I have nothing to 
do with this." 

m.g.: You are perhaps a bit wary of any interpretation 
that might be suggestive of mysticism? 

P.A.: The truth is that I enjoy coincidences. Nature and culture, in bits 
and pieces, run through us with their symbols and obscurities, thus pro- 
ducing various beneficial short-circuits. 

m.g.: One might suppose that the "sacred symbols," at 
the outset, refer to a form of experience that does not 
necessarily derive from any set theory, nor any 
dogma ....

P.A.: Looking at the Apocalypse tapestries in Angers I tell myself that in 
those days 1 would have enjoyed (illusion!) drawing clouds and 
monsters as crude and elegant as those. I recognize these same lines in 
my own work. And when, for instance, I depict a sort of fortress wall 
from another age, I should not be surprised if others begin to think of 
more specific subjects I might not willingly touch upon myself, but 
which appear according to the fancies of my brush .... 
A painting is a revealing slip! 



M.G.: Here is a painting that does not exactly have mar- 
ginal comments. I would be inclined to see a narrative 
sequence, after the fashion of polyptychs .... 

P.A.: One might well diagnose a hypertrophy of marginalia complicated 
by a disappearance of the center. 

M.G.: Your marginalia have, a bit too easily, been com- 
pared to the comic-strip form. I would prefer to see an 
affinity with the narrative idiom of the quattrocento 
frescoes. 

p.a.: If any comic-strip style did influence me, it was the black and white 
variety of yesterday, or even before: the medieval woodcut or again the 
Dreams and Lies of Franco by Pablo Picasso, the father of us all. An ad- 
mission which should only make orphans sneer!

I came across some drawings and etchings of mine, done in 195 1 (in 
Brussels) and 1952 (in Paris), which seem to anticipate a sequential ar- 
rangement of images. But how could I have foreseen the Unfolded 
Newspapers (see cat. nos. 3-6, 8), very much like the marginalia of Cen- 
tral Park, a painting begun in New York after having discovered the 
Park from the thirtieth floor, and seen the paths, rocks and lawns turn, 
before my eyes, into the maw of a debonaire monster devouring yellow 
cabs and pedestrians. "Don't cross Central Park at night?" As we 
know! The painting, begun in New York, was finally completed in the 
country, on the border of Normandy. 

Frame by frame .... In Death and the Maiden, 1967 (cat. no. 12), I 
built a sequence of frames like those of an animated cartoon (the pre- 
della was an ancestor of the cartoon: the painter showed several scenes 
or events connected with the main subject). In Circling the Matter (cat. 
no. 13), done the same year, or in Past Unnoticed, 1981 (cat. no. 50), I 
reproduced in the margins some details that appear in the center, details 
that were enigmatic because of their very singularity. A repetition, with 
amplifications, turns a singular image into a recognizable form. The 
image calls for its double. 

First the center was in color and the remarks generally in black and 
white. Later on I reversed the process. The center would be in black and 
white, in India ink, the margins in color. There were no more separate 
frames but a single runway without visible beginning or end. This 
changes the habits of composition. 

M.G.: As in The Sphinx's Repressed Laughter of 1982 
(cat. no. 53). The margins are done on paper sub- 
sequently mounted on canvas. Do you always use the 
same material? 

P.A.: I vary the supports. In addition to paper from China, Japan, 
Taiwan or Korea, I also use pages recovered from record books of past 
centuries — accountant's sheets, notarized documents, old bills — Rus- 
sian bonds, obsolete aerial navigation maps, etc., which calls to mind 
the principle of the palimpsest. This recycling of old material gives me 
the chance to find something touching: in the discovery of the everyday 
preoccupations of a bygone age, preoccupations so similar to our own. 



2-9 



M.e..: We were discussing the interpretation of a painting 
a while ago and you mentioned the "ventriloquist's 
dummy." Does this metaphor imply that one should not 
listen to what the dummy has to say? 

P.A.: The definitions we add to an indefinite, indefinable yet to be de- 
fined or already (momentarily) more or less identified image are derived 
from daydreams, and each of us does not dream m the same way every 
tune. You cannot bathe twice in the same image. Rather, it is the bather 
who changes — but let's not go into that. 

There is a tree, a quasi-landscape. Great lava flows, a mask in profile, a 
torso wrapped in bandages. Have I sufficiently respected, sufficiently 
clarified the intent of the line? Working in the labyrinth, I clutched the 
thread which (as 1 perceived it) would lead me to the plausible dome of 
a skull, or a slow spilling over of lava or of molten iron. Walkway is the 
title that occurred to me after having finished the border of a painting 
that reminded me of a suspended walkway. This refers to a twofold 
reminiscence: one, a visit to the Pont-a-Mousson Foundry in Lorraine, 
and two, the viewing of Fellini's E la nave va. Micky and I had been to a 
dinner party and there we stood, both of us rather ridiculously over- 
dressed, on the walkway beside a foundry Director in a double-breasted 
suit, like the tourists in the movie looking down on the engine room — 
on the inferno. (I had gone to Pont-a-Mousson in the hopes of finding 
some nineteenth-century manhole covers, but in a foundry every scrap 
of metal is melted down again.) This is merely intended to suggest 
where a painting's title may be found, and by what devious ways. 
Another day, I might only have distinguished a tree: Tree or Walkway, 
one or the other can nonetheless impel one to say: "What do you know, 
a myth!"

abrupte fable 

d'etre d'herbe de verbe de sable de flots 

a serpentements d'orage 

tendre de fruit 

a cheminements presque terrestres 

a traces de presque pas 

a presque rien d'avant 

a developpements 

en roue d'oiseau-lyre 

a brusquement voter 

de nuances ensemble 

a la nuit d'un nuage 

dore jusqu'au soleil 

a depliures de cri 

a bruissements de jour 

a regards de chant 

abrupt fable 

of being of grass of words of sand of wave 

of snakestorms 

delicacy of fruit 

pathways almost terrestrial 

footprints of almost not 

almost nothing of before 

developments 

fanned-out lyrebird style 

suddenly flying 

light and shade together 

by cloudnight 

golden through to sun 

with cry's un foldings 

with day's rustlings 

with the gaze of song

from origin still gearing down from surging 
abruptly but already toward the day gearing up from living 
from face to vision 

from sun to pearl snakeloops to celebration

in reeds all the way to the ocean so spick and span from a sky 
soaring up from earth all the way to a tree's cry 
perennial and yet already threatened by a form of death 
that life itself rejects 
by a new night 

to the highest reach of the same emptiness 
no less peopled with fables 
hardy m the midst of despair of origin of condition 

of living daily reliving 
toward the morning created returning real 
toward the first cry to arise 
in the midst of all forms all colors 
so ardent still 
they launch us into becoming
