ETTORE SPALLETTI • HAIM STEINBACH 



GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM 



PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 



THOMAS KRENS 



The Osmosis series is presented as an alternative to the museum's more 
traditional program of one-person and thematic exhibitions. These 
conventional formats tend to underscore the ingenuity of one artist's 
achievements or the singularity of a particular aesthetic movement. As a 
challenge to such notions, which perpetuate Modernism's faith in the 
concept of originality, Osmosis will encourage artists to work 
collaboratively, mining new aesthetic territory. 

Artistic partnerships — whether fleeting or long-term — have 
flourished throughout the twentieth century. Creative teams, such as 
Serge Diaghilev and Pablo Picasso, and John Cage and Merce 
Cunningham, worked collectively to redefine the boundaries of each 
contributor's art form. During recent years, collaborative alliances — 
including those of Gilbert and George, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Group 
Material, and General Idea — have emerged in defiance of a cultural 
system that privileges the individual artistic personality. 

The Osmosis series, consisting of four exhibitions presented over the 



next three years, brings together artists from divergent disciplines and 

different cultures, whose work may not otherwise have been linked. The 

goal of this process is to promote dialogue, aesthetic interaction, and a 
synthesis of sensibilities. Whatever the final outcome of each 
collaboration may be, it will represent a hybridization of distinct 
expressive means. 

The inaugural exhibition of the series pairs two visual artists. 
Ettore Spalletti and Haim Steinbach, whose oeuvres seem incongruous 
at first glance. Spalletti is known for his freestanding geometric 
sculptures, the austere forms and delicate tonal harmonies of which 
readily suggest the artist's native Italian culture: the elegant contours of 
Roman amphorae, the still figures of Piero della Francesca, and the 
abstracted forms of Giorgio Morandi's meditative still lifes. Steinbach, 
by contrast, culls contemporary artifacts from material culture. He then 
juxtaposes these diverse found objects on his signature wedged shelves, 
effecting subtle and unexpected correspondences that describe current 
cultural realities and value systems. Steinbach's incorporation of exercise 
equipment into his art, for instance, demonstrates his critical 
investigation of the particularly American fixation on physical stamina 
and the "body beautiful." 

An exhibition of such an experimental nature could not have happened 
without the artists' willingness to enter a collaborative dialogue, share 
materials and ideas, and seek new aesthetic solutions. During the past 
two years, Spalletti and Steinbach have met in New York and Italy to 
explore potential points of artistic exchange. We are most grateful for 
their enthusiastic response to our invitation to participate in this series 
and their untiring efforts to produce this innovative exhibition. It 
would have been impossible to present this installation without the 
generous contributions of our exhibition sponsors, the Banco di Napoli 



and the Zerynthia Association, to whom we are most indebted. Giuliana 
Setari was instrumental in helping the museum secure this funding; her 
faith in the experimental process must be commended. We must also 
extend our appreciation to Mario Pieroni of the Zerynthia Association, 
Antonio Homem of Sonnabend Gallery, and Jay Gorney of Jay Gorney 
Modern Art for their assistance in the realization of this exhibition. 
Haim Steinbach's studio assistants Alan Irikura and Robert Reynolds 
were a constant source of information and materials. In Italy, Bonizzella 
Zazzeroni and Anna Constantini were invaluable to the project. A 
special thanks also goes to Pandora Tabatabai Asbaghi for her consistent 
insight into the collaborative process. We are also most grateful to 
Louise Neri and Parkett/Scalo Publishers for their contribution to the 
conceptual development of this publication. 

The dedication of Guggenheim staff members made this 
presentation possible. Working closely with the artists, Jon Ippolito, 
Project Curatorial Assistant, deftly and tirelessly organized all aspects of 
the exhibition. The Technical Services staff, headed by Pamela Myers, 
Administrator for Exhibitions and Programming, lent valuable 
assistance to the mounting of this installation. The commitment of the 
Publications Department, led by Anthony Calnek, Managing Editor, 
was indispensible to the production of this catalogue. We must also 
thank Any Henderson, who lent her talents to the design of this book 
and the Osmosis series publications as a whole. Finally, we owe our 
thanks to the exhibition's curator, Germano Celant, Curator of 
Contemporary Art, who, in collaboration with Associate Curator Nancy 
Spector, developed the Osmosis series. Mr. Celant's innovative vision and 
lifelong commitment to collaborating with artists have led to the 
realization of what promises to be an important new approach to 
exhibitions at the Guggenheim. 



OSMOSIS 



GERMANO CELANT 



The determining feature of the Osmosis series is the movement that 
emerges from the dialogues it promotes between languages that are 
sometimes similar, other times very different: in the course of the series, 
we will see pairings between those who are conversant in art and 
architecture, art and theater, art and film, art and art, art and 
photography, art and music. Our aim is to find a more synthetic 
condition for creative work, for certainly the mutual feedback, the 
blending of approaches, we anticipate will lead to wholly new and 
unpredictable experiences. 

The prompting of an exchange of energy between two artists may 
be tantamount to defining the host museum as a thesis, an argument, a 
consideration, the purpose of which is to develop and deepen an 
interchange among all the arts. Thus, the univocal structure of a 
"normal" exhibition is replaced by the vast communications network of 
a culture that is visual and spatial, aural and tactile, constructive and 
spectacle-oriented. Osmosis heads toward and across the "other," 



reviewing and gathering the histoty of creativity wherever it has 
occurred. Hence, we emancipate the institution from all limits, liberate 
it from obstacles built up by sects and departments, so that it will be 
employed as an unconditionally flexible and versatile instrument. The 
unique subject disappears; the museum is allowed to achieve its 
maximum expansion and art becomes its fulfillment. 

The assembling and coalescing of opposites brings an end to hero 
worship. Osmosis occurs through language, making things concrete in a 
dialogue and dialectic of forms and signs, colors and actions. The focus 
shifts from the artist, as actor and protagonist, to language, which is the 
true source of new experiences and experiments. By giving priority to 
unity and exchange over distinction and competition, Osmosis tries to 
rethink art as a public process and operation, analogous to scientific 
research based on teamwork. 

Still and all, our purpose is not to eliminate the originality of 
unique and individual effort. Instead, by returning to the work as a 
construction and expression of a practice inscribed in the histories of 
other languages, we hope to venture into new solutions and reflections. 
This does not mean reducing differences or flattening out all forms and 
languages into a single register. Rather, we are engaging in a dizzying 
operation that wipes out the primacy of identity. In this way, we 
underscore the value of a dimension that has all the characteristics of an 
experiment in helping to change our relations to ourselves, to reality, 
and to space. Though this maelstrom may do away with architecture or 
design or theater or cinema or art or music as individual subjects, it 
nevertheless directly fosters an alteration of seeing and perceiving. 
Osmosis is an opportunity for exception.

THE DUALISM OF THE BANAL 
AND THE SUBLIME 



GERMANO CELANT 



The history of art has been characterized by a raging dispute about the 
image: one camp has insisted that the relationship between icon and 
reality is fundamental, while the other has rejected figuration outright, 
advocating instead an essential and puristic idea of the world. From 
Byzantium to Rome, from Jerusalem to Moscow, from Paris to New 
York, iconophilia and iconoclasm have been involved in a profound 
conflict, which, both religious and secular, formal and spiritual, physical 
and metaphysical, has flared up again and again. Creating sects and 
trends, the defenders and the destroyers of images have engaged in huge 
and bloody quarrels that are still raging today. 

From 1945 to the present, this dispute has been at the heart of all 
discourse about fiction and reality, matter and spirit, copy and original. 
We need only think of the theoretical and philosophical encounters 
between Social Realists and Abstract Expressionists, Pop artists and 
Minimalists, Neo-Expressionists and Conceptual artists. Theirs were 
battles in a war that pits an art linked to both the visible and the 



invisible world against an art of personal expression, mass media, 
scientific phenomenology, or pure visuality. 

The rivalry between worldliness and archetype, between West and 
East, between the Protestant and the Catholic spirit, has always 
illuminated the developments and the theses of art. Some artists, from 
Giorgio de Chirico to Rene Magritte, from Francis Bacon to Balthus, 
from Andy Warhol to Anselm Kiefer, have favored representation in 
order to incarnate the physical world and its sensory condition. Their 
works maintain the tradition of a visual theology derived from the great 
icons of the Renaissance and Russia. Devouring any object or image 
stemming from the individual and society, these iconophiles challenge 
the reductive and indifferent notion of art. Indeed, because they view art 
as inadequate for life, they take on a realistic position precisely in order 
to allow the coexistence of art and life. Other artists, from Piet 
Mondrian to Kazimir Malevich, from Barnett Newman to Ad 
Reinhardt, from Donald Judd to Joseph Kosuth, have negated earthly 
and carnal images, creating instead an ontological nexus between image 
and mental archetype, between the constructive and the philosophical. 
Their goal has been to safeguard the purity and essence of the concept 
against the representation of the mundane experiences of reality. This 
anti-iconic vision is essentially moral and messianic; it demands an art 
that is a necessary instrument or vehicle for qualifying and 
understanding the cultural context. Theirs is an independent procedure 
based on sound principles and having sound results. 

Both camps claim they are constructing a "gap" between art and 
reality — the iconophiles base their art on the absolute present, while the 
iconoclasts rely on the probable future for theirs. In the past, no 
compromise was possible between these two positions; but today the 
differences between them are mere nuances, and their extremist position 
cannot be maintained. 



The most recent generation of artists has been attempting to 
transcend the contradiction between total acceptance of the historical 
world and the closing of the archetypal vision. Their efforts have led to a 
concept of the "image" that has definitively surpassed both the theory of 
the idea and the theory of the hallucinatory resemblance to reality. The 
paths of the iconists and anti-iconists are interwoven and equally 
insignificant, each of them materializing in an image. 

This situation opens art up to unexpected possibilities. No longer 
expressed in partial and sectarian identities, art fuses into a single and 
unique body, the definition of which unfolds from an accumulation of 
directions and pluralities. Art now wanders and oscillates between 
various possible modes, both divergent and convergent, iconic and anti- 
iconic. This is virtually a passage from the monocentric circle of the 
Renaissance to the polycentric ellipse of the Baroque. 

Art is on the threshold between the physical and the metaphysical, 
between the sensible and the intelligible. This is a territory not of 
harmony and conciliation, but of connection and transition; it may be 
expressed as a visual membrane between mirror images that create a 
perfect circularity between diverse and contrasting universes, fiction and 
reality, Pop and Minimalism, copy and original, Neo-Expressionism and 
Conceptualism, matter and spirit, public and private, visible and 
invisible. 

The existence of this intermediate surface, on which opposites 
converge while remaining opposites, serves as a focus for Ettore Spalletti 
and Haim Steinbach. As artists, they strive to guarantee the practice and 
circulation of assessments that are both sensory and intellectual, banal 
and sublime, consumerist and mystical, material and immaterial. 

Both artists apparently view the transition between images or 
figures of thought and sensibility as a road between a subject of pure 
contemplation and a profanation of its beauty. In Spalletti, this dialogue

between affirmation and loss becomes apparent when the rigid and 
absolute forms of volumes, which recall bowls and vases, discs and 
mobiles, encounter the powdery pigment that concretizes their 
exteriors. In Steinbach, the contact between banal everyday objects — 
outright fetishes of popular consumerism and Pop — and the primary 
and Minimalist shelf on which they are placed presupposes an 
intermediacy that is negated by these two partners in art and the 
language of art. 

A primary and functional structure such as a vase (in Spalletti) or 
shelf (in Steinbach) results from a process of elementary volumetrics, 
whereby weight and gravity are determined by the use of solid 
materials. Yet in both artists' work, we also find an ephemeral and 
tactile presence, such as the soft and weightless chromatic dust

(Spalletti), or the sequence of precarious and commonplace products and 
objects (Steinbach). In their work, both artists establish a mirror-like 
relationship between mutually remote and incomparable realities that are 
essentially different. Such a reflection allows the coexistence of different 
entities without favoring one over the other. The two worlds are 
intertwined, and the resulting art manages to exclude both good and 
evil, sacredness and blasphemy, chastity and pornography. As a result, 
the territory it encompasses includes, if only potentially, all the possible 
topoi of the sensible and the erotic, the tactile and the visible, the 
material and the mental. 

Steinbach's threshold emerges from the encounter between two 
entities: the shelf, designed by the artist as a "memory" of reductive and 
Minimalist sculpture and composed of industrial materials such as

formica or metal on wood; and the numerical progression of things and 
objects that pass from elegant to vulgar, from cold to sensual, from 
elitist to kitschy, from mobile to static. The plane uniting these 
universes is a place of discord and contrast as well as symbiosis, where a 
dialogue ensues between the popular sphinx of mass production and the 
mysterious sphinx of constructive and functional thought. The motion 
across a flat, immobile expanse evokes the journey and the dynamics of 
ghosts or people devoted to nothingness, as in Ingmar Bergman's The 
Seventh Seal or the wagon trains of consumers and pioneers crossing 
America's Great Plains. 

Nevertheless, the procession of banal consumer objects is light and 
free: the artifacts are not fixed, and hence may be moved, touched, and 
seized. They pass across a heavy and static support, as if Steinbach

wanted this mittot structure, this dialogue to reveal the constant 
relationships between two phenomena: an unstable art that resorts to 
using products and simulacra of real society, that is, consumer society; 
and a secure and solid art that believes in building for the future 
according to rules and volumes that are planned and defined a priori. In 
Steinbach, concrete phantoms, representing the frailty and vagueness, 
the make-believe and malaise of a transitory vision, encounter the 
definition of a permanence and a stability that is alive with ideas and 
calculations, with hypotheses of philosophy and artistic language. 

Spalletti likewise constructs volumes and blocks of compact and 
calculated material; they are traversed not by consumer fetishes but by a 
homogeneous yet freely distributed impasto of color so frail and 
transitory that a slight touch may alter the brittle reality. Like 



Steinbach's objects, the pigment — azure or gray, pink or blue — on 
Spalletti's vases and basins, paintings and columns may be perceived as a 
sensory datum, as movement and life, to be enjoyed by anyone willing 
to touch it. 

Steinbach's juxtaposition of consumer products and primary 
structures has the same function as Spalletti's superimposition of 
pulverized pigment on pure volumes. Both techniques utilize the 
kinship between the "here and now" of living and the history of images 
that are absolute and fixed in time. 

We could state that both artists flee, and yet pay homage to, 
formal idealism, in order to venture into the pleasure and sensuality of 
things or epidermises to touch and hold. Thus there is a return to the 
dialogue between Existence and Being, between shadow and substance, 
which are always connected and never at odds. 

In the final analysis, the products and the soft color surface 
constitute a plot or narrative, an active and mobile destiny of seeing and 
touching, while the triangular shelf and the circular vase signify an 
immobility and an eternal return, a completed and reassuring story (one 
that recurs infinitely) of seeing and constructing in art. 

To find a historical analogy, we could cite the enigma of object and 
painting in Giorgio Morandi's metaphysical period. For him, too, color, 
as powder or fresh snow, manages to form carafes and bottles — floury 
volumes and luminescent products. In many of his still lifes, the fluidity 
of the chromatic material confuses and fuses object and shelf, joggling 
their confines, so that the palpitation of the color suggests a transition 
between diverse entities. At the same time, the carafes and bottles flow 
through a vacuum that reveals their enchanted solitude; yet they are 
arranged in a linear and spatial sequence attesting to their equilibrium 
and their inherent absoluteness. In Morandi's work, we see a thoroughly 
balanced harmony of form and tone as well as a perceptional ambiguity 



between object and surface, between spiritual and material elements. 

This "atmosphere" is based on the rational and sensible harmonies 
of shapes, colors, and objects — a legacy of Piero della Francesca, Paolo 
Uccello, Caravaggio. These artists both reveal and conceal the object, 
connecting as well as distinguishing its chromatic and sculptural 
doubleness. In so doing, they close the gap between rational and 
irrational, material and immaterial. 

This same contradiction is apparent in both Spalletti's and 
Steinbach's attitude toward the physical constitution of the work, which 
is entrusted to the sensitivity of the viewer. Both artists leave their work 
open to external intervention, allowing the viewer to alter the sequence 
of objects or the homogeneous quality of the porous surface. 

Steinbach's passage through the forest of everyday objects is a 
mirror image of Spalletti's voyage through the empyrean of colors. Their 
weightless universes are sustained only by the ephemeral splendor and 
voluptuous density of their decor. Rather than an art focusing on a 
Platonic distinction between the "real world" and "apparent world," we 
have one that widens the orbits for both worlds, exposing their 
opposition as a false issue. And if dualism is defunct, its absence 
signifies that original and copy do not exist in art, because every image 
refers solely to another image. Hence, the popular and consumerist, 
ethereal and ephemeral icon reflects the elitist and radical, concrete and 
stable icon, which refers to the other — neither is privileged. The point 
is not an affirmation, but a dissolution, of identities. Hence Steinbach 
and Spalletti intersect on a surface that is available to everyone and 
anyone because it reflects light and images — Spalletti's monochrome 
surface and Steinbach's (sometimes distorting) mirror. "I've always 
thought in terms of surface," Steinbach told me, "of masquerading and 
of the outdoor skin of things. I do not think as a sculptor but as a 
painter. To me all the surfaces are cultural surfaces, the most interesting 



aspect is the overdetermination of the object identity. The way the 
object presents itself, how it is dressed." 1 Spalletti has made a 
corresponding statement: "On the surface I find live material: that 
which the work restores for me." 2 

For Spalletti, color is the site for concretizing forms, as if the 
surface painting, with its accumulation of pigments, its brightness and 
luminosity, were swelling sensually and, with the thickening of the 
material, giving life to his vases. The same applies to Steinbach: in his 
oeuvre, the colors of products fluctuate on the metal and formica 
surfaces of his "abstract" shelves. Here, it is as if color were "placeless" 
and (as in Cezanne) could find its raison d'etre solely by plunging into 
"things." When color is dragged into things and forms they take the 
place of color. Color has become discreet, it has been annihilated by 
something that has abolished all values — the vase or the toy, the basin 
or the medicine balls. 

Thus we arrive at a precarious vortex: color and surface illuminate 
the object, and the object concretizes the chromatic luminosity of the 
subject; fused and united, they permit the use and consumption of the 
surface as an individual and social phenomenon. 

The introduction of the concept of phenomenon can take either of 
two guises: as the trans-sensible or trans-linguistic essence and as the 
body. Here too, Spalletti and Steinbach overlap in their approaches. 
Spalletti virtually emanates (or at least reveals) a conception of art in 
which painting and sculpture dissolve into a sublime being able to 
restrain the essence of color and form. The Italian seems to favor the 
sensible and the trans-sensible, so that his art becomes the home of 
existence in terms of the spirit and the senses or the home of all 
existences in human and animal terms. 

For Steinbach, in contrast, the materialization of the sensible and 
the trans-sensible passes through the materialization of the body of the 



10 



object and of the human being. And if body is language, then language 
becomes body. In the exchange promoted through Osmosis, we detect 
Steinbach's focus on bodybuilding and aerobics: whether by instinct or 
intention, a person can turn his corporeal authenticity into an object 
surface, an artifact among other artifacts, an inauthentic mode adjacent 
to the authentic mode, a modified copy of the original. Bodybuilding, 
from the variety practiced by Arnold Schwarzenegger to that of Jane 
Fonda, transforms a body's reality into a superreality, an excess of 
positivity as opposed to the negativity of the normal. In remolding its 
limits, the body takes on a value that coincides with the marginality of 
objects, thwarting any human power over them. The bodybuilder thus 
reduces the surface of his or her body to an informational space, 
something purely denotative and connoting nothing, because it is 
absolutized and fashioned according to abstract rules. This is an idiotic 
aspect of social culture, which, like the foolishness of objects, should not 
be concealed. The desacralizing and contextualizing of any subject go 
together. For this reason, Steinbach refuses devotion to any subject, 
whether bodybuilding or mass consumerism. And if everything has the 
same value as everything else, the result is absolute equivalence: a 
museum is equal to a gymnasium or to a make-up room filled with 
mirrors. 

But what does bodybuilding have to do with Spalletti's quest for 
the sublime? Both phenomena result from a delusion in dealing with 
reality or with culture; they both operate on the lack of a body or of a 
perfect, metaphysical, almost "divine" body: a situation between a lack 
and a gift, between that which is subtracted and that which is given. 
The generosity of the gift is inherent in the double and in the forgetting 
of reality — both of these can be rediscovered in the space of the Solomon 
R. Guggenheim Museum that has been utilized by the artists for the 
Osmosis installation. Specifically, the specular opening of the mirrored 



1 1 



wall behind the dumbbells is equivalent to huge medieval mosaics ot 
the ceilings in Cinquecento homes; the lattet have mspited Spalletti's 
paintings, which open out luminously and double the perceptible 
extremities of space. This same function of hallucination and illusion is 
created by the chromatic cathatsis of his sutfaces: these cracks in the sky 
and in heaven open theit surroundings to an extraterrestrial panorama of 
light clouds and blank ateas. 

Both Spalletti and Steinbach think of their art in terms of 
doubleness, eithet as a value for opposing the wotld or as an instmment 
for molding it. Hence, on the pages ol this book and in the 
Guggenheim, we find a close bond between mirror and chromatic 
sutface, between watet and marble, between container and content, 
between vase and medicine balls, between art and gymnastics: these 
elements ate linked by a quest for perfection. The search for a self-image 
based on a perfect body can be placed on the same level as a sublime 
sculpture or painting. Both phenomena rely on the perfection of a 
surface or of a smooth and sculptural epidermis that is utterly without 
defects. In this book, the results for both artists are parallel: Steinbach 
has reproduced surfaces of muscles and mirrors — pictorial mimeses and 
watery surfaces; Spalletti gives us a sequence of photographic images of 
details of the marble and chromatic epidermises of his sculptures. These 
artists share a theoretical continuity that assumes reflection — not as a 
reference or a mirroring, but as a meditation on and reconsideration of 
the terms of seeing. Steinbach's mirror is thus the surface, just as 
Spalletti's painterly and sculptural surface is the mirror. In their naked 
reality, both exist halfway between subject and shadow, between reality 
and reflection.

ETTORE SPALLETTI AND HAIM STEINBACH 
TRANSCENDENTAL EQUATIONS 



NANCY SPECTOR 



What is it about Ettore Spalletti's sculpture and painting that causes art 
critics who are usually reserved to rhapsodize about the metaphysical 
and the sublime, about beauty with a capital "B"? Perhaps it is their 
unadulterated geometric forms, which elicit a kind of Kantian aesthetic 
revery from Modernists seeking a state of disinterested desire. Or 
perhaps it is the palette of green, azure, lavender, and salmon — 
suggestive of the mountainous Abruzzi region of Italy, where he lives — 
recalling nineteenth-century Transcendentalist artists, for whom nature 
symbolized the divine. Spalletti's austerity of form and tonal harmonies 
invoke comparisons to Italian Renaissance painting; correlations with 
the works of Piero della Francesca, Mantegna, and Raphael are often 
made. The view that Spalletti is heir to the great tradition of Italian 
religious art inevitably invites an analysis of the spiritual dimensions of 
his work. Certainly Haim Steinbach had such an approach in mind 
when, in correspondence concerning their forthcoming collaboration for 
the Guggenheim Museum's Osmosis exhibition, he asked Spalletti his 



13 



thoughts about Jacopo da Pontormo's painting The Deposition from the 
Cross in Santa Felicita in Florence. 1 

In this collaborative context, the significance of such a question 
lies in the identity of the artist who posed it. If one were to identify an 
artist whose work seems the visual antithesis of Spalletti's refined 
productions — whose projects appear to challenge the metaphysical 
yearnings that such art summons — Steinbach would be a preeminent 
choice. His studied, sometimes witty, often lyrical, arrangements of 
objects culled from material culture appear, at first glance, seeped in the 
secular desires of contemporary society. While Spalletti's almost ethereal 
creations resonate with an aura of timelessness, Steinbach's 
constellations of found objects speak to the present. In isolation, 
Steinbach's objects appear as consumer products; digital alarm clocks, 
chrome wastebaskets, Halloween masks, and Alessi tea kettles have 
become emblems of the commodity fetishism around which the desires 
fueling capitalist culture circulate. But such items are also objects of 
exchange and thus, through association, begin to portray relationships

between people, between cultures, between the past and the present. 
Inexpensive souvenirs, personal mementos, and kitsch keepsakes 
metonymically suggest private memories — real or imagined lost 
moments captured in fading but cherished objects. Similarly, cultural 
artifacts and folk relics communicate the notion of collective memory, 
but Steinbach, ever aware of the relativity of such sensibilities in our 
modern world, pointedly asks us to consider just whose cultural 
memory is being invoked. For instance, the ersatz-African stools made 
from elephant feet arranged on one of Steinbach's signature wedged 
shelves in a 1988 sculpture demonstrate the unfortunate and 
opportunistic ways in which "memories" of Africa have been inscribed 
within Western culture. The elephant skull displayed frontally on a 
separate shelf (forming a diptych with the foot stools) reinforces the fact 
that collective cultural memories are neither neutral nor benign. In 
Steinbach's highly conceptual art, the arrangement and juxtapositions of 
varied objects construct forceful narratives that describe our present 
value systems and cultural realities. For example, his Untitled (guns, hats) 
(1988), in which a rack of vertical rifles that seem to stand at attention is 
topped with a shelf of men's hats, evokes references to the rigid codes of 
masculinity still in place in our society. 

If Spalletti is viewed as a contemporary Rothko, who creates 
classically abstract works with metaphysical associations, Steinbach is a 
present-day Warhol, who unabashedly holds a mirror to our civilization. 
However, to make such a dialectical analogy and define these artists 
solely through opposition is an overly simplistic gesture that dismisses 
other more complementary dimensions of their projects. Another way to 
perceive the two artists' work emerges when reconsidering Steinbach's 
inquiry about the relevance of Pontormo's painting to Spalletti's 
aesthetic convictions. In response to Steinbach's allusion to the tradition 
of Italian devotional art, Spalletti said that he often visited the painting

and commented on the beauty of Pontormo's diaries. He recounted that 
Pontormo once dined with Bronzino and together "they ate a herring."' 
This brief exchange between the artists — Steinbach introduced a 
religious image as a topic for discussion and Spalletti described a 
culinary event — provides some clues to a reading of their work. 

Spalletti's reference to the shared herring can be seen as an 
invitation to read his work together with Steinbach's, to mix things up a 
bit, to play with meaning. If, in this collaborative dialogue, Steinbach is 
going to ask him about the spiritual arena, Spalletti is going to talk 
about the carnal. The goal then is to discover where in their work these 
two different realms — the metaphysical and the empirical — collide. 
Pontormo's and Bronzino's communal meal thus becomes a metaphor 
for the exchange between Steinbach and Spalletti, a metaphor for the 
points of intersection in their art. To extend this metaphor, the herring 
itself takes on dual connotations: it may be read as both the early 
Christian symbol for Jesus Christ and a simple seafood dish. In 
following this double thread we may then ask, what in Steinbach's art 
invokes the transcendent and, conversely, what in Spalletti's entertains 
the corporeal.

While the theory that abstract sculpture emulates the body is 
hardly new, Spalletti's work adds a few unexpected twists to the 
concept. In addition to its verticality, three-dimensionality, and 
existence in time, Spalletti's sculpture has a delicate skin of powdered 
pigment, which seems as permeable as the human body. The sculptural 
surface is thereby transformed from a rigid, geometric container to a 
seemingly malleable substance; contours soften and the works appear to 
breathe. Spalletti amplifies his play with the anthropomorphic qualities 
of abstract form in the cover photograph of the catalogue for his recent 
retrospective at IVAM (Institut Valencia d'Art Modern). In the image, 
the artist is shown sprinkling water onto a small sculpture as if trying to 
make it grow. In fact, the sculpture does have the capacity to absorb 
water and, according to Spalletti, it gradually changes and "exudes" 



17

color with the addition of moisture. 5 The organic properties of the work 
aside, what is most intriguing about the photograph is that the image of 
the artist's body is severely cropped to look like a column, a second 
sculptural form. With this photograph, Spalletti dissolves the 
boundaries between body and sculpture, between the creative act and 
the work itself. 

Spalletti's simulated transformation into an aesthetic object recalls 
the legacy of another Italian artist, Piero Manzoni. On a formal level, 
Spalletti's monochrome canvases testify to his cognizance of Manzoni's 
all-white achromes of the late 1950s, but the artists share a deeper, more 
conceptual, connection. Both of their oeuvres appear informed by a 
conviction that the traditional distinction between art and life is 
erroneous and has only served to perpetuate cultural doctrines that 
privilege the Utopian over the empirical. To illustrate this point, 
Manzoni infused his art with the presence of his own body — filling and 
distributing balloons as quantities of Fiato d'artista (Artist's breath) and 



canning his own excrement to be sold as Merda d'artista (Artist's shit). 
At the same time, however, and quite intentionally, his quixotic 
gestures evoked connotations of the spiritual. According to Germano 
Celant, Manzoni metaphorically extended what he construed to be the 
aesthetic potential of his own being to the masses by signing other 
people's bodies and proclaiming them Sculture vivente (Living 
sculptures). 4 But as with the reception of Spalletti's art, exclusively 
religious interpretations are often proffered instead of readings that 
capture the critical, even parodic, dimension of the work. When, for 
example, Manzoni distributed hard-boiled eggs marked with his 
thumbprint for consumption at a gallery opening in i960, his action 
was compared to Christian communion. 5 The deliberate provocation 
inherent to Manzoni's actions went largely unnoticed. Few, if any, critics 
questioned the economic and cultural implications of an artist claiming 
the products of his own body as art. No one acknowledged Manzoni's 
investigation of the artist's relation to his or her own means of 
production and of the art world's conflation of aesthetic value and 
exchange value (aspects of the work which are astutely reflected in 
Steinbach's practices today). And most noticeably, no one commented 
upon the remarkable humor informing Manzoni's oeuvre. 

Spalletti, too, effects a curious blend of the religious and the 
corporeal, and not without a touch of sly humor. While alluding 
through conventional formal devices to the transcendental, Spalletti 
simultaneously reminds us that his work is actually embedded in the 
body. In addition to ingeniously weaving his own person into the work 
through photographic references, the artist creates sculptural surface 
coverings so fragile that the touch of a human hand can completely mar 
their visual integrity. What appear to be the abstract sculptural essences 
of immortality, are, in essence, highly vulnerable entities. By imbuing 
these sumptuous forms with a human (i.e. temporal) presence, Spalletti 



19 



metaphorically unites the sensual and the supersensual realms. What, 
after all, is transcendence but basic human striving to overcome 
adversity, to broaden boundaries, to seek inspiration? The search for 
transcendence is a perpetual process that comes not from above but from 
within. 

Steinbach's work also challenges Western culture's conventional 
dichotomy between the aesthetic object and lived experience. When 
paraded across shelves or placed in armoires, his found objects do not 
acquire the status ol Duchampian "ready-mades" merely by assuming 
the stance of displayable art in a gallery or museum context. Instead, 
Steinbach's objects persist as objects, stubbornly maintaining their 
empirical connection to the "real" world and adamantly describing their 
place within it. However, this does not mean that these highly 
premeditated selections of objects lack aesthetic value or a certain 
poetry. Like Proust's madeleine, a singular familiar item can elicit a 
flood of associations, memories, and desires. Or as architect Adolf Loos 
once remarked, "even- piece of furniture, every thing, even- object ha[s} 
a story to tell, a family story. "" In a number of Steinbach's sculptures, 
the narrative revolves around issues of the body, ranging from personal 
hygiene — toilet brushes shown with laundry bins — to physical strength. 
Medicine balls, mirrors, and barbells populate many of the recent works 
in reference to a particularly American obse-ssion with the body 
beautiful. In this way. Steinbach's project also refers to Manzom's 
interest in the corporeal dimension and ventures a similar fusion of art 
and life. Whereas the Italian artist used mundane items — such as 
balloons, cans, and eggs — to contain and convey bodily products, 
Steinbach's objects are inanimate props that indicate bodily presence. 

The exercise equipment and expansive mirrors used in Steinbach's 
sculptures may be considered as surrogates for the people who utilize 
them in their quest for physical perfection. The cold metal armatures of 



20 



the Nautilus machines embody the desire that drives gym patrons in 
search of steel-hard muscles, boundless stamina, and super-human 
strength. In contemporary American culture, this zealous pursuit for the 
ultimate physique can be understood as a crusade for personal 
transformation or transcendence. The concept of transcendence has been 
secularized in the modern world and there now exists a panoply of ways 
to reach nirvana. Tele-evangelism offers spiritual transport in the 
privacy of one's own living room, while "religious" experiences have 
been known to occur in aerobics class or at rock concerts, through mind- 
altering drugs, or even hang-gliding. Steinbach illustrates this cultural 
phenomenon with insight and humor in his 1987 installation Spirit I. 
Comprised of two brand-new, gleaming, freestanding universal weight- 
lifting machines and thirty-six lava lamps on a three-tiered chrome 
shelving unit, the work symbolizes contrasting methods employed in 
the contemporary search for individual revelation. Lava lamps, favorite 
1960s decorator items, are better remembered today as props for drug- 
induced, hallucinatory experiences, as designer furniture for the LSD 
generation. The ever-floating, ever-mutating forms in the illuminated 
belly of these lamps have come, like black-light posters, love beads, and 
incense, to represent a time in the not-so-distant past when psychedelic 
drugs were equated with spiritual elevation. The Nautilus machines — 
stream-lined exercise equipment designed to pump and flex every 
muscle — represent the current mania for physical perfection. In our 
culture, the lean, well-toned physique has come to signify absolute 
mastery over the body. This intoxication with control comes with moral 
implications: the ability to overcome all physical obstacles and appetites 
is lauded as exemplary behavior. And the rewards for such self-denial? 
The capacity to re-shape one's anatomy and attain the appearance of 
eternal youth. If people cannot determine their ultimate destiny, at least 
they can look good. The feelings of achievement and invulnerability

thus gained are, for many today, the ultimate goal — corporeal 
transcendence with an eye toward immortality. 

Steinbach's Spirit I, with its allusions to secular modes of physical 
and mental transcendence, embodies the dualism inherent to our Judeo- 
Christian heritage. United in one installation, the exercise apparatus and 
the lava lamps symbolize the bifurcation of human existence into two 
discrete, but interrelated, realms: the bodily or carnal on one hand, and 
the cerebral or spiritual on the other. Throughout the philosophic and 
religious traditions of the Western world, the physical domain has 
invariably been construed as the great impediment to spiritual 
evolution: desires of the flesh have been considered enemies of the soul, 
and bodily weaknesses such as illness, fatigue, and hunger have been 
seen as distractions for the mind. The traditional path toward 
transcendence, therefore, has necessitated that the body be conquered 
and subdued in order to secure the unhindered development of the soul. 

This division between body and mind is, in essence, a dialectic, 



22 



since one realm cannot function without the other. The struggle 
between the physical and the mental, between the carnal and the 
spiritual, between life and the hope for immortality, is fundamental to 
being human. In both Spalletti's flirtation with the corporeal and the 
sublime, and Steinbach's engagement with Western dualism, 
transcendence is not an absolute state, but rather a process that requires 
a simultaneous respect for the physical and appreciation of the mental. 
It is at this triangulated point — the delicate configuration of body, 
mind, and the search for transcendence — where Steinbach's and 
Spalletti's works converge. While neither artist is making claims to the 
transcendental — Spalletti plays with it as a visual trope in art and 
Steinbach illustrates its current cultural manifestations — they both 
insist on the centrality of the body to any spiritual or aesthetic pursuit.

ETTORE SPALLETTI AND HAIM STEINBACH 
A CONVERSATION 



GERMANO CELANT 



Germano Celant brought Ettore Spalletti and Haim Steinbach together in Italy 
on August 31 and September 1. 1992 to discuss the Osmosis installation and this 
publication. In the process of developing their collaborative ideas, they raised the 
issue of the relation of the body to touch, vulnerability, and desire. They also 
discussed the points of contact between such disparate subjects as Michelangelo 
and cosmetics, armoires and ergonomics. Mannerist sculpture and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 

germano celant Since your plans for this collaborative 
installation involve embedding mirtots in the walls, a viewet will see 
reflections of net ot his own body in the same space with the objects you 
cteate for the exhibition. What do you think is the telationship between 
these two expetiences? 

ETTORE SPALLETTI What I have in mind is the image of 
paintings on the walls and sculptures on the floor plane. And there will 
be a third image, that reflected in the mirror. We will have two 
exhibitions: a real one, and one inside the illusory depth of the mirror. 



56 



HAIM steinbach The mirror and the objects are reflective 
forms of our own invention. The large mirror is traversed by a hanging 
chrome rack with a row of dumbbells. Both are there for the body to 
interact with physically and perceptually. The mirror also refers to 
tangibility, if only by the mere fact of the intangibility of the reflected 
image. It invites a psychological-spatial response as well as a desire for 
touching. Identification with the circular and the elliptical distorting 
mirrors is less direct. The recognition of an aberration of surface invites 
you to say, "wait a minute, that's not a normal mirror, what is it?" — so 
you sort of want to go over and you end up looking at yourself. 

E.S. Notice that the elliptical mirror has a proportion similar to 
that of the body. 

H.S. And like the mirror, the gessoed pigment on Ettore's work 
invites you to touch it. 

G.C. Ettore, I am interested in this tactile aspect of your work. 
\bu have said that Arte Povera was important for the ability it gave art 
to occupy space in a sensitive rather than a rational way. The material 
has always been touchable, has always been activated in a visual way. 

E.S. The material itself is unchanging. When the material is 
touched by the artist, it comes to inform us of something else. 

Then it is fixed. 

At that moment neither the material nor the color can go back to 
their place of origin because they have become something else. The oil 
paint cannot go back into the tube. 

G.C. The artist always has an interest in emphasizing the concrete 
language of things. As with their spatial poetry, it is difficult for an art 
work to proceed backwards, to go back to the zero point of the materials; 
the Dadaist tradition, however, did posit this doubt, of signs moving 
freely in the whole with no limit. A distinction is in fact noticeable 
between your work and that of the historical avant-garde, precisely in its 



57 



difference ot attitude. Haim looks to Duchamp. whereas Spalletn turns 

ize to Morandi: both "painted" everyday objects (that is. they 
inserted them into paintir_ 

E . S . I like to think that my work retains the wholeness or" the 
moment in which I made it. I would like it to remain new, untouched by 
the taste of time. 

Berore they decided : [est re it. the Sistine Chapel was dirty, and 
ne still believed that that really was the color that Michelangelo 
tec : : be. I climbed up the scaffolding one day to &gt;ee the cleaning 
close up, and the color d to me was very striking. The image I 

had was of many h ;olor. of yellow, blue, indigo. Or color inside 

glass containers th me a vision ot something in ruil relief, ot a 

color that immediately afterward c zeiling in the same full

G.c. The other night we ^generation of 

the body. I: someone touches the seductive skin ot your work, it mars 
the powdery surface and the surface must be re-sanded. So is it possible 
to preserve the work as it appeared in the moment or its creation? 

E . S . When they ask me to restore a work. I can never really figure 
out the exact moment ot its creation; I iuperimp se on this 

moment another moment. 

Berore. Haim asked me abou fts, preserving an appearance 

in the mos: ex generosity ot our being. I p:e:e: real cosmetics. 

those that doc: allow themselves : ivered. 

G.C. Everyt crested in keeping the momentum ot the 

productive age — beauty, youth, etc. Keeping this kind :: productive 
-_- means that you don't emphasize every moment ot your lite. You 

:\d certain elements. A painting is produced in a certain 
moment in time, in a context, and doesn't have this kind of life, this 
kind of change of enetgy, because it represents an extreme point or 



i = 



energv at a terrain moment in history. So it's perhaps difficult to accept 
that this energy can be changed in time, or it you do accept that it's no 
longer part of the piece, it's just a change or manipulation or the piece. 

H.S. The seductive surfaces of Ettore's sculptures call for the 
potential for rapid degeneration of the work, given the possibility that 
the gessoed and powdered surfaces may be touched. 

G.C. If you are inviting interaction, that doesn't necessarily mean 
that you don't want to maintain the inherent qualities or the work. 

H.S. Nonetheless it's a potential in the work, and it may happen. 

G.C. The pieces invite one to cultivate sensitivity about what is 
fragile. If you offer certain tactile elements, you are not necessarily 
inviting destruction. \bu can perhaps invite a positive, not a negative, 
attitude to the work. 

H.S. I think that the fragile element requires sensitivity and care, 
but it also is a manifestation of vulnerability. When you talk about the 
body and the references of physical reality, there is also the aspect of its 
fragility, its vulnerability, and its ephemerality, which is another 
reference to Ettore's work. But there is also materiality and the 
degeneration, the death — in terms of disappearance, obsolescence, 
dysfunction, or damage — of material things. 

G.C. Don't you think your work has the same kind of fragility v In 
your work, there is the potential to touch, but there is also a distancing 
that results from the shelf or pedestal. I see then that both your 
attitudes are similar: there is ephemerality, because the work can be 
destroyed — if you break a vase, you can replace it, just as you can restore 
Ettore's varnished surface. 

H.S. You can't always replace the objects in my work. 

G.C. Yes, sometimes they are unique or historical. So then there is 
a transformation, because as soon as I move the installation over by an 
inch, or I replace a gray cup with a white one, I have a different meaning 



59 



... so it seems to me that both of you are dealing with a sort of dualism 
or dialectical situation that is there, but which could disappear. You are 
proposing a vulnerability, but a vulnerability that is aggressive. When 
you break or touch an object, you feel guilty. Vulnerability becomes an 
issue of respect and sensitivity. I see both ideas on the same die. 

H.S. But though you may think positively about these things, the 
issue of the disintegration of the work is an issue of the reality of objects. 
The focus in my work is not the new; the work also extends to old 
objects, and to objects that have been damaged — they may be aging, 
aged, disintegrating, or disintegrated, but they are objects nonetheless — 
they may have or have had an ideal reality at one point ... it was a 
machine that worked, an object that was a vibrant orange that happened 
to be made of plastic, that got left out in the sun and lost its original 
color. That doesn't mean that the object has stopped living; its life has 
taken on a new reality. 

G.C. \es, but the difference is we're not talking about the 
deterioration of individual objects, we're talking about what happens 
when we manipulate the configuration of the objects. 

H.S. Well, in my work, I put the pieces like pieces in a chess game 
and I say, this is the order. The institution where the works are installed 
protects the work, because it needs it. Too much touching or handling 
destroys the work. But since the work involves selection and 
arrangement, since the collector becomes an accomplice in the act of 
arranging, the viewer, too, is implicated in this interaction. 

I understand the ideological side of what Ettore is doing. I 
understand and respect it. But I think that he has built into his work 
the problem of maintenance. Even if no one touched the work, even if 
everyone venerated and respected it, it would have to stay in one place 
and never be moved because the minute someone acquires it, they have 
to touch it to move it, and so the surface must be violated. In my work 



60 



people have co place the objects and follow my instructions, but they 
may miss doing so and that's a problem, but it's also a. problematic of the 
work. I made a conscious choice not to glue or bolt the objects to the 
shelf or box to which they are assigned. 

E.S. The problem of tactility is fundamental, and I feel very 
strongly about it with respect to my work. But the tactile cannot always 
be resolved with touch itself, just as not all expressions of desire can 
really be lived. 

G.C. But you have to respect the desire of the "other." 

E.S. The fact of desire being lived as something always legitimate 
is a profoundly materialistic notion. What I see as being really 
materialistic is the desire to touch and discover everything. I like the 
idea of a surface expressing a strong tactile desire, and at the same time I 
like to discover that it is possible to live this desire in the very 
restraining of action, in the impossibility of realizing the desire itself. 

H.S. We are talking about the construction of desire's physical, 
psychological, and spiritual aspects. It consists of possibilities and 
impossibilities as well as allowances and disallowances. Also there is 
appreciation and lack of appreciation, sophistication and lack of 
sophistication, culture and lack of culture, civilization and lack of 
civilization. Children, at first, have more liberty to have all kinds of 
sensual experiences; they are allowed to touch. Then they are allowed to 
touch but not to hit. Later on, they're not allowed to touch anymore. The 
social being becomes more self-controlled in relation to touching and 
interaction, as well as to erotic desire and its expression. Then society 
changes the terms and there is a bit more tolerance. That doesn't mean 
that because there's more tolerance it all becomes materialistic — it may 
be an art. Dancing involves touching but it's an expression, not 
materialism. Touching a surface doesn't have to be materialistic. 

E.S. A nude painted by Titian comes to mind.

G.C. Desire is the secret lymph that fuses the high with the low, 
the periphery with the center, the spirit with the body: it represents the 
feverish pulse toward the "other." There are varying degrees of contact or 
even seduction, but these are always bound to a body that is not 
possessed. In the case of the overflow of objects of consumption one may 
speak of a fragmented body that cannot be pieced back together. The 
strength of the desire to possess them makes it clear that the person is a 
nonunified combination of elements. Thus the consumer seeks the 
means to satisfy the eyes, the sex organs, the ears, the nose, the mouth. 
There is, on the other hand, an attempt to possess a body that cannot be 
possessed: i.e., one's own body, as "designed" by body building. In this 
case desire is bound to a "poorly built" entity, a body that people want 
to bring back to the dissection table, to free it from excess and 
deformation. Here the transubstantiation of Titian's Venus coincides with 
the rebuilding of a Schwarzenegger in a reconstituted body. The new 
being is the being that mirrors itself, like the witch in Snow White, in 
order to emerge as the new technological Narcissus, purified of all dross 
and all error. 

H.S. This concept brings back the idea of narcissism, which has to 
do with the preservation of youth and beauty. It consists of historically 
cultural conditions. Yxi have beauty parlors, hairdressers, physical- 
fitness programs, clubs ... all are part of the desire to maintain the 
integrity of health and beauty. One way that'we maintain this desirable 
condition is by looking in the mirror. Yo\i look at your body and how it's 
developing. Yow are involved with its upkeep, fighting against time, 
fighting against aging. 

E. S. I'm not too sure how fitness culture can construct a body; 
rather, it manages quite well to shape it. When I saw an image of Ben 
Johnson, I was struck by the power that his body expressed. I think it is 
this aspect that modern society is in some way trying to imitate. 



62 



Ironically, although he created a model figure of the contemporary 
athlete, he was immediately punished for it. 

H.S. Ben Johnson is also a symbol of the body's overcoming time 
or distance. Steroids are the technical aspect of the transformation of 
bodies, as opposed to the ideology of the body as an organic, natural 
whole. Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator represents a body that 
is a synthesis of the organic and the inorganic. 

G.C. The idea of a supreme, sublime body becoming pure through 
a process of gradual rarefaction is recognizable over the course of art 
history, from Phidias to Canova, from Classicism to Neoclassicism. The 
attempt at artistic mimesis has always been an attempt to transform 
human presence into concept, passion into idea. To sculpt the pure body, 
at the limit of its unnatural beauty. The perfect blend of gesture and 
material in Canova inspires the balance of pigment (polvere di colore) and 
volume in Spalletti, yet it likewise informs the industrial assemblage in 
The Terminator and the liquification of the character in Total Recall. The 
subject is always the metaphysical body when the skin is a surface of 
marble or platinum, an extremely vital body that expropriates life. It is 
the same duality that one finds in the dialogue between objects of 
consumption and the minimalist structure in Haim, or in the dialectic 
between the active, light material (the pigment) and the passive heavy 
form (the vases and bowls) in Ettore's work. Poetry lies in the double, in 
the mirror as in the water, in the surface and in the objects to be 
touched, entities in which our bodies are reflected. 

E. S. I can only say that when I see a body sculpted by Canova I 
recognize a quality that I had never previously seen, not on the street 
nor on the beach — nowhere around me, in short. Not a progression, but 
an invention. It was certainly an intimate nature, a private desire that 
Canova possessed, an inner vision and image all his own, and he was 
able to offer it to all, to let everyone see it. In this way, different 



63 



expressions of the body always represent different realities. These 
realities are true constructions. I very much like Paul Valery's saying, 
"The skin is deepest," because I tend to think — given my physical 
inactivity, among other things — that the beauty of the body is also 
achieved from the inside out. Of course the body of a great athlete is 
also beautiful; these are two different ideas. 

G.C. Do you see your work, in some sense, as figurative sculpture? 

E. S. I try to make color be a figurative imagining; oftentimes I 
hear my work described with expressions of a figurative nature. I use the 
color pink with flesh in mind. 

G.C. Is your color a kind of skin? 

E. S. I do not think of color as surface color. A painting painted in 
oils lacks the ability to absorb; the colored matter can only thicken 
outwardly. In the end you might also think of overturning the palette 
onto the surface of the canvas. 

For this exhibition I am thinking of the mirror that Haim uses and 
I think of it inside the reflection containing the color of the mirror, a 
color ranging from silver to mercury. That is my vision. Through the 
mirror, through the reflection of color in the mirror, we should find a 
different volume. I think of the objects used in physical culture, the 
chrome weights that will be reflected; perhaps all will become like 
water. I had considered building a little fountain that would spout a jet 
of vodka. 

H.S. Speaking of a fountain, you know that water doesn't fall in a 
lump, but has a different dynamic with respect to gravity from static 
objects. And the body is some ninety percent water. So I'd like to talk 
about how gravity relates to the bodies you create. With this sort of 
sculpture especially there is a play on gravity. If you have a cone that 
goes up in reverse and is heavier on top than on the bottom, it bears on 
a certain kind of lifting or coming down, it has to do with the bottom 



64 



and the top. It concerns a point of contact with the ground in relation to 
gravity. Then it brings to mind ideas about weightlessness and 
movement; you even have a reference to a flying saucer in one of your 
sculptures. 

The tradition of Italian Mannerism has to do with gravity. In 
Pontormo's Deposition from the Cross they lower Christ's body and you see 
and can almost feel how they're holding it. That's about gravity, that's 
about taking the body down from the cross and the weight of it and how 
it falls in people's arms. A medicine ball is also about gravity. I'm 
interested in how these contemporary technological references, like 
flying saucers and medicine balls, overlap with the tradition of Christian 
iconography of spiritual transcendence. 

G.C. In your sculpture/paintings the shelf contains and sustains 
the event. It is like a space that grinds and gives birth, generates and 
elicits tenderness and cruelty, irony and tragedy, intimacy and 
impetuosity — a horizontal, pregnant womb engendering the breath of 
the everyday: the substances and relations between life, both private and 
social, and things. 

H.S. When I started building these shelves, I was thinking about 
them in terms of architecture and in terms of objects as being the 
modifiers, the translators, the mediators by which we understand space 
socially, institutionally, artistically. Similarly, in my work Untitled 
(French walnut armoire, Cuban mahogany armoire) an architectural 
reference is present. These very large armoires from the eighteenth 
century were made for the big rooms of the chateaus of the aristocracy. 
They were meant to play with the scale of the rooms. They were about 
spaces within spaces as well as the affirmation of mass and gravity. And 
yet they were lightened up by the ornate curves of their fringes. 

Of course, the shelf unit is very different psychologically than the 
cabinet or the closet. In the cabinet, the situation is always one of 



65 



protruding from the wall into one's space. 

G.C. The shelf allows you to move and permute objects, whereas 
these massive box-like containers imply a different weight in society, an 
occupational space, a symbolic implication of space. 

H.S. The position of the viewer in his space in relationship to the 
object. 

G.C. In a certain way the armoire is something that controls you. 
\bu have to go up to it. \bu cannot bring it with you. 

H.S. Exactly. There's a sociological and psychological language 
that has to do with one's mobility in space, with the proximity or 
distance regarding people and objects. 

G.C. It has to do with territory. 

H.S. \es, territory and boundaries regarding self and possessions as 
well as use of and interaction with objects. 

G.C. Ergonomics — when they study how the configuration of 
benches at school affects the way children relate to each other and form 
groups. 

H.S. And it relates to my interests in institutions, in the 
institutions in which objects exist, or the institutions that make them 
be what they are or the institutions that they make because of what they 
have become. 

G.C. Let's discuss the dialogue between this construction — the 
shelf — and the selection of objects, which is a' different attitude. It's an 
important point, because in your work and in Ettore's there is a similar 
system. There is a construction that you control, and a construction that 
can be touched. For Ettore, there is a form that is a pedestal, a base, on 
which there is pigment. For you, the shelf is a pedestal to display your 
sensitivities, a dialogue or analogy of sensitivity. 

H.S. I work with formal, material, and sensory issues, mediums 
that are used to convey messages conceptually and visually. At a certain 



66 



point, I wanted to throw myself into the world, to enter the realm of 
improbabilities, risk, and insecurity. If my medium is paint and a brush, 
I have a certain control. But if I throw myself into the world of objects, 
and say anything is allowed, any arrangement, then it is chaotic and 
confusing . . . where is my artistic control? So I have to give myself some 
kind of an anchor, some kind of a set-up. I have to make a structure 
within which I can introduce, direct, organize the unstable object. I 
wanted to find a way to employ formal devices in order to elaborate on 
the social reality inherent in objects. I invented the shelf in the way that 
someone invented the tuba. The tuba can't play like a violin, but it has 
certain flexibilities, and within those flexibilities one can make certain 
emphases to create a sense of time, a sense of empathy. My shelf 
becomes an instrument that has absolute structural and aesthetic 
parameters. I use that instrument in order to emphasize and de- 
emphasize different aspects of the objects. The objects are highlighted; 
correspondences between elements of their design and shape are 
underscored. I want to make their surfaces and skins talk, exposing their 
contents and their relations. 

G.C. How about your selection of objects? Take, for example, the 
piece with the wooden shoes. Are you satisfied by the way the artisan 
has done this object for you? Did you commission it or did you find it? 

H.S. I bought them from this guy here in Venice. These wooden 
boots are not necessarily my ideal standard of beauty nor Ettore's, I 
assume. These are not two boots carved by Canova, either. This work is 
about the relativity of desire and standards of beauty other than the 
artist's. 

G.C. Ettore, if your forms are pedestals for color, where do your 
choices of color come from? 

E. S. I get up in the morning and go into my studio; I don't know 
what to do, so I stroll through my work, suddenly stopping in surprise 



67 



at the sequentially of forms and colors: "I don't like that pink so close 
there, so I move it and put a neutral gray in its place, then a cobalt blue, 
an ultramarine, then a Prussian blue." I am in the studio; only a faint 
light indicates the outside to me. I don't like the idea of work in art; I 
prefer the idea of a painting that appears miraculously. When it 
succeeds. 

For the collaboration, I had the idea of constructing a large tub. I 
thought of medicinal flasks, and of how to pour water into the tub; I 
thought of the work in entirely chromatic terms, charcoal black for the 
tub, leather black for the medicinal flasks; and I thought of these colors 
in relation to all the others, so as to be able to present a great fresco, and 
another one on top of this, which would appear frozen in the mirror's 
reflection. On the real surfaces, the pigments, through abrasion, are 
fragmented once again. In the apparition there is no notion of soft or 
hard; one is as though enfolded in an atmosphere of color: chalk white, 
coal black, earthen brown, sky blue, flesh pink. 

G.C. You describe form as enfolded in color, yet many of the forms 
themselves resemble containers: vases, pots, bowls. There is thus a 
dialogue between container and contained, between full and empty. 

H.S. Like Ettore's forms, a mirror may evoke a blue surface that 
could be empty or full, like an ocean. A black well has the same 
ambiguity. I see Ettore as filling up minimalist forms with evocative 
spaces, with sensuality. It could be a response to twentieth-century 
gridded cities and their highly rationalized forms. 

E.S. I do not complement, as Haim says, minimal forms with 
sensuality; I fill the surface of the panel with drawing and color, or else I 
roll the panel until I have a vase or a column. I have always imagined a 
long wall on which I would place all my work, one piece after another: a 
great fresco, a great landscape. I think of Minimalist art when I look at 
photos of my work. A photograph gives me something different; I prefer 



68 



black and white. 

H.S. To the extent that we both use primary geometric forms, 
however, I think it has to do with a response to our high-tech, mass- 
production, functional era. We have a shared yearning CO engage these 
forms on our terms. This show is about that sort of criticism. Ettore's and 
my work have a critical dialectic with reductive and minimalist ideas. 
Despite talk of objects, there may be no objects, just paradigms of 
objects. 

G.C. Ettore, do you think of your works as objects? 

E. S. I always refer to my works as paintings or sculptures. The 
eternal form of the panel encloses, as it always has for me, the inner 
content. Inside is the figurative imagination that the fragmentation of the 
pigment produces in the desire for an atmosphere, for an atmospheric 
image. . . . We're in Venice, I'm thinking of San Marco, an amazing place, 
or of Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa, the cathedral square: to look at those 
"objects" placed on the grass and then to think that de Chirico's little 
painting with the tower is as big as that piazza.
