Pablo Picasso arrived at many of his greatest breakthroughs in 
the context of his association with other artists, such as his Cata- 
lan compatriot Julio Gonzalez. During a brief collaboration be- 
ginning in 1928, they created astonishing sculptures in which 
they used iron as a draftsman uses line (a development that 
would be termed "drawing in space"), and— for the first time in 
art history— space was given the same consideration as matter. 
Their work in turn became a reference point for American 
sculptors Alexander Calder and David Smith, who assimilated 
the ideas of European Modernism and forged the foundation for 
a new Modern art in the United States. At the same time, Swiss 
artist Alberto Giacometti employed the physically solid and 
durable medium of iron to explore the elusive and immaterial 
realms of human psychology. 

This book, published in conjunction with a major exhibition 
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, 
brings together an impeccable selection of sculptures by all five 
artists from many of the greatest public and private collections in 
Europe and the United States. Also included are several related 
paintings and drawings by Picasso, whose audacious and vital 
vision was, in this case, as with Cubism, the source from which 
other artists took their inspiration. 

This rich publication includes an extensive essay by the distin- 
guished art historian Dore Ashton, who charts the course of

Preface 

It would be impossible to imagine twentieth-century art history without Pablo 
Picasso, whose lifelong creative invention repeatedly changed the course of visual 
thinking. His defining influence is felt not only in painting and the graphic arts 
but also in sculpture, as this exhibition and catalogue demonstrate. Yet Picasso was 
only one of five great artists whose work, taken together, comprises the "Age of 
Iron," the period situated historically in the tumultuous years between the two world 
wars, and geographically between Europe and America. In the present exhibition, 
select sculptures by Picasso, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Julio Gonzalez, 
and David Smith are placed in a rare formal dialogue with each other— and with 
Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum. 

Picasso developed many of his greatest ideas in the context of his association 
with other artists, most famously (in the case of Cubism) with Georges Braque. 
Another such encounter, also of groundbreaking importance, occurred from 1928 to 
1931, during his collaboration with his Catalan compatriot Gonzalez; together they 
developed the concept of "drawing in space." Picasso's and Gonzalez's work in turn 
became a reference point for American sculptors Calder and Smith as they assimilat- 
ed the ideas of European Modernism in and around Paris. Forging innovative 
approaches to the medium of iron sculpture, Calder and Smith helped lay the foun- 
dations for a new Modern art in the United States. At the same time, Swiss artist 
Giacometti employed the physically solid and durable medium in order to explore 
the elusive and immaterial realms of human psychology, equating sculpture and 
mental space. 



Calder, Giacometti, Gonzalez, Picasso, and Smith shared a passionate fascina 
Hon wiili the ancient, mythical tradition ol iron sculpture .is well as the modern, 
tangible dynamics oi "drawing in space." Then sculpture relies on an essential, ele- 
mental process ores from the earth are transformed by fire through a liquid (water- 
like) state into sculpture thai envelops air. Iron, finally, is as resistant and enduring 
as space is elasti( and ephemeral. In a dialectic where material and space become 
equal, these sculptural objects are as irredudbly unique as they are part ol the fabric 
ol our environment. 

Wright's Guggenheim Museum can be described in similar sculptural terms— 
the sinuous line ol the spiral creates an interior ol active space yielding at its dome 
to the sky and a universal cosmos. The museum has played host to works by these 
live great artists many tunes ewer the past decades. The Guggenheim introduced 
their work to generations ol museum goers through landmark retrospective exhibi- 
tions devoted to Calder (1964), Giacometti (ts)ss and 1974), Gonzalez (1983), and 
Smith (1969); of course, the Guggenheim's permanent collection is also one of the 
richest in us holdings ol the work oi Picasso. 

And so it is litting that the Guggenheim should bring together works by 
these five greal artists who together wrote one vital chapter in art history. My thanks 
go to Carmen Gimene/, Curator ol Twentieth-Century Art, and her collaborators 
on this project, the art historians Dore Ashton and Francisco Calvo Serraller and 
the designer Juan Anno, for the rigor ol their selection and the visual poetry of 
theil installation. We are all most grateful for the essential cooperation of the artists' 
families, which allowed the realization oi Picasso and the Age of Iron. The result, 1 
believe, truly represents the visual and historic drama ol the "Age ol Iron."

Acknowledgments 

Picasso and the Age of Iron has been realized through the generous cooperation of a 
number of people to whom we must express our deepest gratitude. First, we wish to 
thank the artists' families and heirs who aided our project. The children and grand- 
children of Pablo Picasso— in particular Bernard Ruiz Picasso, Marina Picasso, 
Paloma Picasso-Lopez and Rafael Lopez-Cambil, and Maya Ruiz Picasso de 
Widmaier— have been a great help to us. The essential works of art that they have 
entrusted to the exhibition as well as their invaluable advice and information have 
been crucial. Carmen Martinez and Viviane Gnmminger collaborated with the loan 
of important works by Julio Gonzalez and also with vital documentation from the 
artist's personal archive. We sincerely appreciate Mary, Howard, and Holton Rower's 
consistent, generous support and tireless efforts, which testify to their deep esteem 
for and knowledge of Alexander Calder's oeuvre. Candida Smith offered an enthusi- 
astic response to the exhibition, and, together with Peter Stevens and Rebecca Smith, 
actively participated in the various phases of its development and entrusted to it an 
important group of works by David Smith. Through their significant loans and 
counsel, the artists' families have allowed the exhibition to be realized. 

We thank all of the participating private collectors, including those who 
chose to remain anonymous, for their invaluable loans that contribute so greatly to 
the success of the show; we would especially like to acknowledge Ernst and Hildy 
Beyeler, Dr. and Mrs. Arthur E. Kahn, and Jan Krugier and Tzila Krugier. 

We received generous loans from each and every one of the participating 



museums. We would like to recognize our debt to the following institutions, in par- 
ticular: in Europe, to the Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul-de-Vence; Alberto Gia- 
cometti Foundation, Zurich; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice; the Estate of 
Hans Hartung; Institute Valenciano de Arte Moderno, rVAM Centre Julio Gonzalez; 
Kunsthaus Zurich; Kunstmuseum Basel; Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg; 
Louisiana Museum, Humlebaek; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Moderna Museet, 
Stockholm; Musee national d'art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musee 
Picasso, Paris; Tate Gallery, London; and, in the United States, to the Hirshhorn 
Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., The Museum of Modern Art, 
New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and Whitney Museum of 
American Art, New York. We are especially grateful for the help of many directors 
and curators, among them Carmen Alborch, Felix Baumann, Dominique Bozo, 
Dr. Christoph Brockhaus, Magdalena Dabrowski, James T Demetrion, Dieter 
Koepplin, Steingrim Laursen, Brigitte Leal, Franz Meyer, Richard Oldenburg, Earl 
A. Powell III, Jean-Louis Prat, Gerard Regnier, Cora Rosevear, David Ross, Margit 
Rowell, Philip Rylands, Mark Scheps, Katharina Schmidt, Helene Seckel, Nicholas 
Serota, Bjorn Springfeldt, Vicente Todoli, Kirk Varnedoe, and Germain Viatte. 

We would also like to express our gratitude to a great many people who made 
contributions through their patient research and their answers to countless ques- 
tions. Among them are Douglas Baxter, who supported our undertaking from the 
beginning; David McK.ee, who afforded his great knowledge of Smith's work and 
spared no efforts toward our project's success; Joan Washburn, who always showed 
her generosity towards the exhibition; Jacques Dupin and Lisa Palmer, who proffered 
their help and resources with regard to the work of Giacometti; and Daniel Abadie, 
Heiner Bastian, Evelyne Ferlay, Alvin Lane, Claudia Neugebauer, and Catherine 
Thieck. 

In addition, we wish to thank Juan Ariho, who designed the catalogue and 
exhibition, and Santiago Saavedra, who oversaw the various phases of the produc- 
tion of this publication, which exists as a result of his enthusiasm and constant 
efforts. 

We are greatly indebted to Francisco Calvo Serraller, for his contribution to 
the concept of the exhibition and his catalogue essay; and to Dore Ashton, for not 
only her illuminating essay but also her irreplaceable ideas and advice for the show's 
development. 



We would like to recognize some of the many Guggenheim Museum staff 
members who fulfilled the demands of the project. In Madrid, M. Dolores Jimenez- 
Bianco and Martina Schneider were essential to the development and coordination 
of both the exhibition and the catalogue. In New York, the support of Thomas 
Krens, Director; Michael Govan, Deputy Director; Gail Harrity, Deputy Director, 
Finance and Administration; Maryann Jordan, Director of External Affairs; Paul 
Schwartzbaum, Assistant Director for Technical Services and Chief Conservator; and 
Lisa Dennison, Curator of Collections, was invaluable to the exhibition. Carole 
Perry, Assistant to the Curator; Joanne Chan, former Assistant to the Curator; and 
Essicka Kimberly, former Administrative Assistant, contributed throughout different 
periods of the exhibition's development. Amy Husten, Manager of Budget and 
Planning, coordinated financial matters, and Lynne Addison, Associate Registrar, 
Exhibitions, handled the complex transportation arrangements. 

Pamela L. Myers, Administrator for Exhibitions and Programming, oversaw 
the exhibition's installation and its many technical requirements. Scott Wixon, 
Manager of Installation and Collection Services; Peter Read, Manager of Fabrication 
Services; Laura Antonow, Senior Lighting Technician; and AH Hocek, Architect, 
directed various aspects of the exhibition's production and installation. For their 
efforts, we would also like to thank the technical team that worked on the mount- 
ing of the exhibition. 

To all of those contributing to the success of Picasso and the Age of Iron, muse- 
um staff as well as outside participants, we wish to convey our sincere gratitude.

Introduction 

"Within this century, then, Julio Gonzalez stands alone, the rare blend of an artist 
who is both modern and a humanist," wrote Leo Steinberg in 1956, when the 
Spanish sculptor had his first major American exhibition. "Modern he is because 
his forms are vital, open processes in space. He is a humanist, firstly, because man is 
his lasting theme, and his works, when they seem least anthropomorphic, remain 
anthropo-kinetic. And secondly, because the kind of kinesis he imputes to man 
tends to be proud, free, energetic, eliciting not pity or recoil but admiration." 

At the time of that Gonzalez exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New 
York, sculptor David Smith, who had first seen the Spanish artist's metal sculpture 
in the 1930s in John Graham's collection, wrote a letter to Gonzalez's daughter 
Roberta, both to tell her of the impact that her father's exhibition was having on 
local artists and to express his conviction that Gonzalez would be remembered "as 
the father of all iron sculpture of this century." While this is not the place to dis- 
cuss the critical merits of such an emphatic judgment as Smith's, it is certainly a 
true reflection of Gonzalez's importance to Smith's own subsequent development. 
In any event, even allowing for the slow process of critical recognition of the value 
of Gonzalez's late works, it is quite surprising that, until now, there has not been an 
exhibition examining their historical and aesthetic context in order to fully reveal 
the contribution of those works to twentieth-century sculpture. Even more startling, 
given the almost tiresomely reiterated insistence on the close relationship between 

&lt; Pablo Picasso's Figure (fall 1928), proposed by the artist 

as a monument to Guillaume Apollinaire. Gonzalez and Smith, is that there has never been a specific exhibition making man-

ifest not only those two artists' formal affinities but also their contrasting attitudes 
and world views, through which one addressed the sacred, the other the profane. For 
this as well as other reasons, I believe that an exhibition dealing with these issues 
would be welcomed, although a show restricted to these two artists alone would only 
yield a strictly correct academic approach. Without the tutelary presence of Picasso, 
such an exhibition would not only lack an essential historical context, but, more 
important, would not communicate the full dialectical strength of iron sculpture as 
dessiner dans I'espace (drawing in space), to borrow the much-quoted description used 
by Gonzalez in one of his writings. 

Almost all the experts who have studied the birth and development of this 
type of iron sculpture agree that the original conception came from Picasso and rec- 
ognize the importance of Gonzalez and Smith in creatively exploiting its syntax and 
vocabulary. Therefore, from the perspective of a strictly historical reconstruction, I 
believe that an exhibition based solely on the iron sculpture of these three great 
artists, Picasso, Gonzalez, and Smith, would have been well justified in historio- 
graphic terms. However, I, and everyone else who has worked over the last several 
years on the project presented here under the title Picasso and the Age of Iron, feel 
that such a restriction would have resulted in an oversimplification, devoid of those 
complex aspects surely necessary to a full understanding of the work of the three 
sculptors and of their significance within twentieth-century sculpture. 

The exhibition ranges from about 1925 to 1950, encompassing what in art his- 
tory has been called the dramatic high point of the 1930s: the crisis of the avant- 
garde. In the 1930s, Gonzalez's work finally matured, and Smith began to develop 
his later style; only Picasso seemed to be slightly ahead of them. The fact that in the 
early 1930s he was making iron sculpture as well as heavy, sensual, rounded stone 
pieces— the work that so impressed Brassai' and Andre Breton when they visited his 
Boisgeloup studio— confirms Picasso's creative restlessness. 

The 1930s was not only the decade of "realisms," a term that has been used to 
summarize its spirit of politically committed art, but also a time of radical self-criti- 
cism by the European avant-garde, a process whose antecedents can be traced to 
Dada and Surrealism and to the first stage of the Soviet avant-garde. Along with the 
serious social and political events weighing so heavily on the era's more lucid 
minds, artists had to confront the widespread renunciation of artistic formalism 
and the institutionalization of the avant-garde. It is significant that the two domi- 



H 



nant avant-garde positions in the 1930s, the Abstraction-Creation group and the sec- 
ond, "rational," wave of Surrealism, agreed upon the need to re-create and redefine 
the language of the avant-garde, with a new emphasis on its meaning. 

In light of these underlying historical and artistic problems, is an exclusively 
formalist frame of reference sufficient to understand the meaning of the work of 
these innovators in iron and to encompass in the term "Age of Iron" all that they 
produced using that one metal? Although the Industrial Revolution, with its large- 
scale use of iron, had transformed the old material into a symbol of progress, it was 
also seen as a destroyer of traditional ways of life and culture, thus generating the 
false idea of a radical incompatibility between art and iron, similar to that under- 
stood to exist between art on one side and the machine and all industrial produc- 
tion on the other. The importance of iron in sculpture cannot be reduced merely to 
the avant-garde's desire to be provocative by using such an unconventional artistic 
material. It seems necessary to explain, therefore, that in these pages "iron" not only 
refers to the use of a specific material at a certain time in the evolution of Modern 
art, but also represents a metaphor for the crisis that arose in both society and the 
avant-garde itself between the two world wars. 

Steinberg pointed out the dialectical tension between the modernist and 
humanist spirit in Gonzalez's work, a tension that has also been noted by other crit- 
ics, although they may interpret it differently. The simultaneous exhibition in Paris 
in 1937 of two such totally different works by Gonzalez as Montserrat and Woman 
with a Mirror illustrates this duality. While it is often stressed that Gonzalez was 
originally a craftsman and therefore interpreted modern ideas from a traditional, 
anthropomorphic viewpoint, even Picasso, that champion of the modern, always 
stubbornly opposed a totally abstract art. In fact, the majority of the Spanish avant- 
garde during the first third of the century felt this same reluctance toward complete 
abstraction, which may be explained by their forebear's anthropomorphic tradition. 

Whatever importance we ascribe to them, cultural traditions alone cannot 
account for Picasso's and Gonzalez's use of iron in sculpture, because a cosmopoli- 
tan language such as that of the avant-garde cannot be contained within a national 
culture. Perhaps the crises of the 1930s created a window of opportunity for a clear 
expression of cultural roots, both in Spain and abroad. In fact, as the institutional- 
ized avant-garde established its own conventions, the reactions of Smith, Calder, 
and Giacometti to the return to the figurative were perfectly in tune with those of 



IS 



Picasso and Gonzalez, even though these five artists came from countries as distinct 
from each other as the United States, Switzerland, and Spain. 

The decisive artistic question was posed by Gonzalez in his "drawing in 
space," a phrase that sums up and clearly defines the styles of Picasso, Gonzalez, 
Smith, Calder, and, to a lesser degree, Giacometti. Accordingly, although an acade- 
mic approach would have advised a prudent limiting of our exhibition to certain 
works by Picasso, the later works of Gonzalez, and the early sculpture of Smith, we 
decided that works by Calder and Giacometti— the real activators of that dialectic 
tension of sculpture as metallic drawing in space— should be included. Thus, while 
we realized the conceptual and practical complications of using five voices instead 
of three, we felt that it was worth the risk. This dialogue among five voices, more- 
over, confirmed the fluid exchange of ideas initiated by Picasso and Gonzalez and 
extended by Calder, Giacometti, and Smith. 

The inclusion of drawing and painting by Picasso is essential to this sculpture 
exhibition rather than merely complementary. His preliminary series of line and dot 
drawings from 1924 and 1926, as well as his series of drawings from sketchbooks 
1044 and 021, both from 1928, are often invoked to explain the ideas that would be 
crystallized in his monument to Guillaume Apollinaire. Similarly, Picasso's paint- 
ings of the 1920s and 1930s reflect the problems that he addressed in his "drawing 
in space." 

It must be noted that the number of works by each of the artists varies in 
accordance with the ways in which each dealt with the underlying questions. The 
versatile and restless Picasso soon abandoned a form that was to constitute an obses- 
sion tor the steadfast Gonzalez and the focus of his most interesting and fruitful 
period. Gonzalez and Smith were to devote their energies to developing the possibil- 
ities of iron for "drawing in space," in sharp contrast to Giacometti's approach. In 
addition, we were unable to obtain some works by Giacometti that undoubtedly 
would have improved the exhibition because their fragility or state of conservation 
prevented them from traveling. 

Finally, it must also be mentioned that after this brief period in which the 
creative energies of these artists coalesced, all of them, except Gonzalez (who died 
shortly afterward), began to develop very different styles. For this reason, we have 
included at least one later work by each artist, which can be seen either as the clos- 
ing of one chapter or the opening of another.

The Forging of New Philosophical Armatures: 

Sculpture Between the Wars and Ever Since 

Between the wars: "nothing durable, nothing solid" 

During the uneasy years between the two world wars, Paris was still considered the 
incomparable crucible for new ideas, at least in the arts, as so many memoirs writ- 
ten by expatriate Argentineans, Japanese, Cubans, North Americans, and 
Scandinavians inform us. Yet, over the city hung a cumulus of vague but keenly 
sensed forebodings expressed again and again by French intellectuals and their for- 
eign guests. A prolonged threnody wound through those troubled years until its pre- 
dictable denouement in the eruption of World War II. As Europe edged toward dis- 
aster during the 1930s, the tone darkened: "These last twenty years have indeed wit- 
nessed the most considerable intellectual tumult imaginable. Nothing durable, noth- 
ing solid, nothing which is constructive; everything is crumbling, losing its verte- 
brae."' So said an unusual group of intellectuals, among them Roger Caillois and 
Georges Bataille, in their 1936 "Manifesto for a Sacred Sociology." That year, an 
erstwhile Surrealist, the actor and writer Antonin Artaud, told an eager audience at 
the University of Mexico that French youth were no longer content with ideologies, 
and that "these young people feel that Europe has lost its way, and they think that 
it is knowingly and one may say criminally that Europe has lost its way."' In anoth- 
er 1936 lecture he echoed what many other intellectuals in Paris were intoning in 
newspapers and journals: 

Anyone who knew Paris three years ago and returned there now would not 
recognize it. In appearance the city has changed little, but the life of Paris, 
everything that made it exciting, the youth, the movement, the zest, the 



19 



enjoyment, all this has changed terribly. . . . And French youth, left to them- 
selves—I am speaking especially of the young painters, sculptors, actors, film- 
makers, etc.— are on the edge of despair.' 

This despair had been mounting year by year as the temporary relief just after 
World War I evaporated into what the sociologists had called intellectual tumult. No 
matter from what direction, the news was disheartening. In 1928, a scholar remote 
from the artistic circles Artaud moved in, Julien Benda, published his outcry The 
Treason of the Intellectuals, causing a furor by accusing the thinking caste of giving 
way to nationalism, xenophobia, and class hatred and of acquiescing to what he pre- 
dicted would be a horrible conflagration, which indeed occurred a decade later. 
Benda rejected the blatant Surrealist attack on reason, and even though he was far 
from the artistic milieus that shared certain of his views, his belief that Europeans 
had betrayed the great tradition of disinterested thinking and spiritual values was 
widely shared. 

While it is true that immediately after World War I there were optimistic voic- 
es heralding what Jean Cocteau called a rappel a I'ordre, it took only a few years for 
most intellectuals to begin to doubt the value of such order. By 1924, the Surrealists 
were mounting their energetic attack, and the rout of the "recall to order" was under 
way. There were great artistic battles, but somehow everyone was losing ground. The 
Surrealists, who proclaimed the value of "thought's dictation" and the free associa- 
tions inspired by dream imagery, were opposed by artists schooled in the rigors of 
Cubism. In 1929, a motley international group of painters and sculptors formed a 
group, Cercle et Carre (Circle and Square), to defend the basic idea of "structure 
and abstraction." Among them, however, were artists who could just as easily have 
exhibited with the Surrealists, such as Jean Arp, who in fact sometimes did, and 
Joaquin Torres-Garcia, whose sojourn in Paris from 1926 to 1932 brought him to 
consider the ancient symbols of pre-Columbian art, which also greatly interested the 
Surrealists. In 1931, another group, Abstraction-Creation, was established by an 
important international group of artists numbering in the hundreds, to battle the 
pernicious Surrealist habit of smuggling realism into painting and sculpture, but 
even here a softening of principle was evident. Many practitioners of "abstraction" 
had already been seduced by the Surrealist notion of biomorphism. Theo van 
Doesburg could rant against what he called the "Jack the Ripper style" of the 
Surrealists, but their widespread incursions were apparent. (And van Doesburg him-

self, after all, had ambivalent loyalties when, a few years before, using the pseudo- 
nym I. K. Bonset, he had written Dada poetry for De Stijl magazine.) For all the 
passionate idealism of certain prominent members of Abstraction-Creation, the 
group as a whole offered an amalgam of mixed idioms, even a fundamental confu- 
sion. 

Sometimes, especially during the late 1920s, the commentators of quotidian 
artistic life would refer vaguely to the existence of a "crisis," and the word became 
ubiquitous in the 1930s. There were those who tried to put a healthy skew to the cri- 
sis in artistic values. When Christian Zervos founded Cabiers d'art in 1926, he 
watched the new generation closely for signs of vitality. His colleague E. Teriade 
kept trying to discern positive trends, as when he wrote in 1930 that both painters 
and sculptors often begin with plastic ideas of Cubism but now arrive at "a lyrical 
reality, exalted by memory and mysterious magic." 4 Far away, in the United States, 
the artistic life of Paris was watched very closely by anxious aspirants to the interna- 
tional avant-garde, but by 1936, even they were disillusioned: 

In 1936 it should have been apparent— heaven knows— that something was 
about to happen in art as in everything else. But there was a comfortable feel- 
ing at the time as though the critical years of revolution had already been 
surmounted. Most of the European innovators themselves gave indications of 
getting back to "normal"; certainly they produced nothing so insulting to tra- 
dition as in the stormy days of cubism and the fauves. In the light of subse- 
quent developments it becomes difficult indeed to recall the precarious posi- 
tion of an experimental artist during the reactionary thirties.' 
It was in the "reactionary thirties" that smoldering embers of rebellion would 
flare up in works of distinct originality— works strong enough to have survived and 
inspired generations of artists to come. To what extent the troubled epoch was 
responsible for the generation of such works is probably incalculable, yet we cannot 
discount th? heated philosophical, social, and aesthetic arguments that engulfed 
artists in Paris during the late 1920s and 1930s. The idea forces of the time included 
the Surrealist assault on the strictures of classical reason and the rebel-Surrealist 
assault on classical idealism. Andre Breton exhorted artists to break free from all 
habits of thought by journeying to the deepest, the oldest sources, and by commit- 
ting themselves to what Octavio Paz called a "stubborn belief in a paradisiac age, 
coupled with the vision of the primordial couple,'"' exalting the powers, he said, of 



21 



the word "love." Breton's affirmation of the original innocence of man, Paz said, 
distinguished him from all his contemporaries, including Bataille, for whom "eroti- 
cism, death and sin are interchangeable signs whose combinations repeat the same 
meaning again and again, with terrifying monotony: the nothingness of man, his 
irremediable abjection." 

And yet, it was Bataille who instigated the manifesto for the College de 
Sociologie, devoted to a sacred sociology that would study three principal problems: 
"that of power, that of the sacred, and that of the myth . . . the total activity of the 
human being"— problems very much at the heart of Breton's own writings. Bataille's 
hyperbolic style was in many ways symmetrical with Breton's: Bataille, for example, 
wrote, "Le desespoir intellectuel n'aboutit ni a la veulerie ni au reve, mais a la vio- 
lence,"" while Breton wrote, "La beaute sera convulsive ou sera pas."'' And the two 
chefs d'ecole both helped to provoke the immense renewal of interest in primitive arti- 
facts, but, this time around, imbued with a scientific cast. In 1925, the Sorbonne 
established its Institut d'Ethnologie, where Marcel Mauss later taught the young 
poet Michel Leiris, whose life among avant-garde artists was legendary. By 1930, the 
old Musee ethnographique du Trocadero, in whose musty halls Pablo Picasso, 
Georges Braque, and Henri Matisse had learned about so-called primitive art, was 
organized in a scientific way, and by 1938 was reorganized as the Musee de 
l'Homme, in which Leiris worked as a social scientist. From the late 1920s, the pub- 
lications most important to the artistic community— Zervos's Cahiers d'art, Bataille's 
Documents, founded in 1929, and Minotaure, founded in 1933— published articles by 
some of the most distinguished ethnologists of the period, including Marcel 
Griaule, Abbe Breuil, Georges Henri Riviere, and Otto Frobenius, as well as serious 
reviews of the work of American anthropologist Franz Boas. 

No doubt the level of scholarship of these articles was far less important to 
visual artists than the excellent reproductions that accompanied them, which pro- 
vided a range and variety of inspiration, particularly for sculptors seeking ways to go 
beyond prewar Constructivist inventions. In 1930 alone, Documents published a sub- 
stantial article with illustrations of the carvings of the Haida in the Pacific 
Northwest, and long essays by Frobenius on newly discovered works in Africa and 
on the elongated Etruscan bronzes; for its part, Cabiers d'art published articles on 
works from the Colima region in Mexico, from Vancouver, and from West Africa, 
and, perhaps most important, the rarely reproduced statuettes of elongated metal

Such concentrated interest in non-European art perhaps signals a kind of 
flight from the European malaise, a desperate rummaging for other traditions to 
fulfill deep psychological needs. A few prominent figures in the pre-World War I 
avant-garde followed up their initial interest in non-European art after the war by 
traveling to the fabled sites, while others stayed in Paris and associated with expatri- 
ates and visitors from those foreign cultures. In 1923, Blaise Cendrars made his pil- 
grimage to Brazil, where he experienced the wilder side of folk life. That same year, 
Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos came to Paris for a few years; at first he was 
scarcely noticed, but by 1927 Paris was avid for reports from other cultures and keen 
to experience the direct impact of what it imagined to be authentic primitive feel- 
ing. Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro had lived in Paris since 1916, and was a 
cofounder of the important postwar literary journal Nord Sud, along with 
Guillaume Apollinaire and Pierre Reverdy. After working for twelve years on his 
long poem Altazor, he published it in 193 1 with the subtitle "Voyage in a 
Parachute" regaling such friends as Arp, Juan Gris, and Picasso with its hurtling 
spatial images and its magical message of flight, punctuated by the urgent refrain 
"there's no time to lose."' 

The presence of innumerable eccentric personalities contributing to a shift in 
perspective in Paris certainly had an impact on restless artists, and notably on sculp- 
tors. The Surrealist preoccupation with objects naturally affected the kind of work 
made by sculptors, among whom the issue of objectness had become increasingly 
important since the turn of the century. In a penetrating study of the evolution of 
Modern sculpture, the sculptor William Tucker identified the issues: 

If one word captures the aspirations of modernism from about 1870 to the 
Second World War, it is surely object. Firstly in poetry and painting, then in 
sculpture, music, and architecture, the word came to denote an ideal condi- 
tion of self-contained, self-generating apartness for the work of art, with its 
own rules, its own order, its own materials, independent of its maker, of its 
audience and of the world in general. . . . Sculpture, of its nature is object, in 
the world, in a way in which painting, music and poetry are not; thus, ambi- 
tion of the poem-object, the objet-tableau , continued to be active. ... In fact, 
the object-status of the poem or painting tended to release and enlarge the 
evocations and associations in the component words or depicted subject, 



23 



whereas the effect in sculpture was the reverse: as the sculpture-object of the 
poem approached the reality-object in the form of intention, the gap between 
them dwindled to the point at which all reasons for making sculpture and 
indeed art in general, seemed to disappear. This was the nature of the crisis 
that was experienced by advanced art in the 1920s, when most artists— includ- 
ing those who had been chiefly responsible in achieving the success of "the 
object" in sculpture and painting, Brancusi and Picasso— seem to have felt an 
impulse to move backwards or forwards violently' 1 

The spasmodic violence of this backward-and-forward movement was evident 
to many viewers, and, as was so often the case, was epitomized in the between-the- 
wars work of Picasso, whose 1932 retrospective revealed the extremes of his moods 
and techniques. Surely Breton found confirmation of his notion of the crisis of the 
object when he visited Picasso's studio in 1933, accompanied by the photographer 
Brassai. The photographs that Brassai' shot there focused noticeably on objects, both 
those created by Picasso and those with which he surrounded himself in his envi- 
ronment, which together constituted what Breton would call Picasso's "element."' 
Breton had long understood the importance of Picasso's most radical gestures. It was 
he who insisted to his patron, collector Jacques Doucet, that Les Demoiselles 
d'Amgnon was essential to his collection. He wrote to Doucet on November 6, 1923, 
"A single certitude: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon because one enters completely into 
Picasso's laboratory and because it is the mode of the drama, the center of all the 
conflicts Picasso has given birth to, and that will continue eternally" And a year 
later, on December 12, 1924, he wrote again, saying, "It seems to me impossible to 
talk about it other than in a mystical fashion. The question is only posed afterwards. 
. . . For me it is a pure symbol, like the Chaldean bull, an intense projection of the 
modern ideal that we begin to grasp bit by bit . . . it is for me a sacred image." 
Later, Breton, in an article entitled "The Crisis of the Object," located "the whole 
pathos of modern intellectual life" in the fact that it resides in an unremitting quest 
tor objectification. In the article, he quoted the philosopher Gaston Bachelard, who, 
he said, asks what is the primordial metaphysical function of the real and answers 
that it is the conviction that "one will discover more in reality than in the immedi- 
ate data surrounding it."" 

Where else but in sculpture would the "objectification" Breton spoke about 
find its apotheosis? Judging by the pages of the most widely read reviews, sculpture

was at last finding the kind of serious critical attention it had long been denied. 
Picasso's reputation helped focus attention on sculpture once again when, beginning 
in the late 1920s, for the first time in years he turned his full attention to the mak- 
ing of three-dimensional objects. He heralded a widespread renewal of interest in 
experimental sculpture, not only in France but throughout the Western world. It was 
still Paris, and Picasso, to whom most artists in the Western hemisphere looked, and 
still Paris that provided the foundation for the work of those artists, even Americans 
who tried to resist the influence. Foundation, as Gertrude Stein illustrated in a cun- 
ning anecdote about Paris on the brink of World War II, was everything. A friend of 
hers, a captain, approached the garrison cook and said: "Will you, said Captain 
dAiguy, make us a good risotto, I cannot, my captain, said the soldier who was a 
cook in one of the big restaurants in Paris, because I have not the foundation for 
the sauce. Foundation for a sauce, said the captain, pale with fury, you have materi- 
al to cook with, everything you want and you cannot make your sauce you have to 
have a foundation, what do you mean by a foundation. If you please, said the trem- 
bling cook, in Paris we always have a foundation for a sauce and we put that in and 
then mix the sauce." M 

The new foundation being laid in Paris would provide the basis for many a 
piquant sauce, but also for genuine innovations. The general climate of thought, the 
necessity for violent changes— these were quickly communicated, with artists 
responding and retreating in different stages, and with constant realignments and 
shifts of direction. Into this continuum entered the five artists represented in this 
exhibition, each carrying his own art-historical influences and antecedents, and in 
each of whom the idees forces of the period worked differently. Quite aside from gen- 
erational differences, there were differences in their formative encounters and their 
subsequent development that account for the diversity and strength of their contri- 
butions to Modern art history. That history, so difficult to elucidate, can be seen as 
more like a ade chart than as the trajectory of an arrow, full of the whorls, circles, 
and eddies, the digressions and shifts, that a tide chart documents. None of these 
five artists was a native Parisian, yet all of them drew upon the singular history of 
Paris between the wars for their independent artistic discoveries. It was above all 
Picasso whose initial moves were indisputably the source of the crisis in sculpture, 
and who initiated the metaphorical age of iron, with all the implications that this 
show documents.

Picasso's many forked paths 

Without speculating on the circumstances of Picasso's personal life— which was in 
turmoil— or on any of the intangibles that govern the moods of artists, one can see 
in his moves of the 1920s apparent trails leading toward his concentration on sculp- 
ture. After World War I, he had turned away from the logic of Analytic Cubism (a 
logic he sometimes stressed when he talked of African sculpture, although at other 
times he spoke of its "exorcist" powers). The conflict born in Les Demoiselles was sus- 
tained by Picasso in the work that followed, even as he continued his sporadic flir- 
tation with classical art. He pursued many forked paths simultaneously, as when he 
painted the fiercely expressionist The Dance in June 1925, and the classicizing Studio 
with Plaster Head a few weeks later. Only a year before, in June 1924, he had created 
the scenery and costumes for the ballet Mercure, inventing for the tableau called 
"Night" a rattan framework within which he placed mobile cardboard shapes. It was 
perhaps the first indication that he would move toward three-dimensional wire 
sculpture, since his construction plan for the decor of "Night" looks very much like 
many of his subsequent sculptures. It was also a succes de scandale. The Surrealist 
band, led by Breton, at first condemned Picasso, and nearly caused a riot by hissing 
and booing the opening night. The next day, however, in Paris-journal, they issued a 
public apology in which they praised Picasso for despising all sacrosanct conven- 
tion, and for never pausing in his "perpetual creation of the disquiet, the searching 
anxiety of our modern days."" While many Picasso commentators have been at 
pains to insist on his remoteness from Surrealism, it is obvious that Picasso was 
keenly interested in the expansion of possibilities inherent in Surrealist notions. 
Moreover, because the original group consisted largely of poets— and he had always 
preferred the company of poets to artists— it was natural for him to warm to their 
advances. His close and lasting friendships with Leiris and Paul Eluard date from 
around this time, as does his closer relation with Breton, who published works by 
Picasso in almost every issue of La Revolution surrealiste, beginning with the first 
issue in 1924. 

In the years immediately following the initial rapprochement with individual 
Surrealists, Picasso began to propose in his many sketchbooks a series of outlandish 
projects that appeared to echo the Surrealist preoccupation with metamorphosis, 
and that increasingly demanded a three-dimensional realization. These included, for

example, his 1927-28 drawings of heavily modeled, metamorphic figures that he 
explicitly thought of as monumental sculptures to be erected along the promenade 
in Cannes. During the summer of 1928 in Dinard, he saw the Surrealist poet 
Georges Hugnet almost daily while he was assiduously sketching the lineaments of 
his wire sculptures, which he produced as soon as he got back to Paris (cat. no. 27). 

There, sculptor Julio Gonzalez, Picasso's old friend from Barcelona, had also 
been living for many years. It is usually assumed that Picasso had renewed his 
friendship with Gonzalez the previous spring with the specific purpose of acquiring 
techniques of welding. But why iron forging and welding, and why Gonzalez? Surely 
there was a need that went beyond simple practicality. Throughout his life Picasso 
maintained relationships with fellow Spaniards, and most particularly, with Catalan 
artists. Since most commentaries on Picasso's oeuvre have been written by French, 
American, or European critics, the issue of his Spanish nostalgia is usually handled 
gingerly, if at all. The fact remains that he was careful to stay in touch with his earli- 
est memories through relationships with such artists as Pablo Gargallo, Manolo 
Hugue, and Gonzalez. The last wrote in a 1935 article that, although Picasso 
deserves to be claimed by every country, he is "ours": 

I have known Picasso for more than thirty years, and whenever I have seen 
him and talked to him— which has happened often— we have talked about 
Catalans, and he has spoken nostalgically of Barcelona, of Perpignan. He 
remembers their festivals, their traditions, sardana, dancing, fairs, demonstra- 
tions, and all kinds of events, and he remembers things in great detail. 
Everything Catalan is of interest to him.'" 
Picasso's earliest biographer and lifelong friend, Maurice Raynal, did not hesitate to 
attribute to him what he thought of as Spanish characteristics (such as a sense of 
tragedy, a characteristic that Gonzalez confirmed) and commented: 

Though no chauvinist, Picasso is a Spaniard through and through. . . . For all 
his long years of residence in France, the country of his choice, he has 
remained deeply sensitive to events on the other side of the Pyrenees. I 
remember his bitter and outspoken indignation in 1909, early in the reign of 
Alphonso XIII, when Ferrer, one of the socialist leaders of the uprising in 
Barcelona, was hailed before a military court and summarily executed.'" 
One of the things Picasso never forgot, it seems, was his early exposure to the 
art of the ironworkers of Spain, among them Joan Gonzalez, Julio's older brother, 



27 



whom Picasso knew in the years before his first trip to Paris in 1900. Perhaps an 
even more plausible source lay in his youthful admiration for Santiago Rusinol, a 
Spanish artist who was twenty years older than he, and whose cultural center in 
Sitges was a magnet for the art students of Picasso's generation in the mid-to-late 
1890s. Rusinol was an enthusiast of the ironwork traditions and owned an extensive 
collection. In an 1895 lecture he had spoken of the forges of old Barcelona: "There, 
in the darkness of those sooty workshops, under the ringing chorus of constant 
hammering on the anvil, I think I see springing from the tire . . . an art without 
aesthetic rules or absurd restrictions, an art free as smoke, born from fire, and 
wrought in tire." 

Gonzalez insisted in his article that Picasso was influenced above all by the 
"milieu of his formative years," a belief shared by most Spanish writers and by many 
Spanish artists who kept in touch with Picasso over many decades. He was, as so 
many remember him in the Barcelona days, an attentive listener, and, as young as 
he was, he knew where to go and whom to seek out. In 190 1, for instance, he spent 
a few months in Madrid, where he met the Catalan writer Francisco de Asis Soler, 
with whom he decided to publish Arte Joven, a literary and art review. The first issue 
included poems by the venerated Miguel de Unamuno and an essay by Pio Baroja, 
both of them major figures in the Generation of '98 and probably a direct influ- 
ence on the young Picasso. Unamuno's views, especially, were not only congenial to 
Picasso's temperament but were also used by others to describe or explain him in 
later writings; at the very least, they were an important component in the milieu of 
his formative years. In an introduction to a collection of Unamuno's writings, 
Salvador de Madariaga asks, "Who but Unamuno could have invented that title 
Nadu menos que todo un hombrei n and describes the paradox of Unamuno as follows: 
"This apostle of life, this eloquent advocate of irrationality and experience versus 
reason and intellectualism lived mostly in the mind."" Unamuno unabashedly 
spoke of the "soul of the Spaniard," an aspect of himself and his countrymen that 
Madariaga explains in terms of "the deep tendency of the Spaniard to deny reality 
the right to be itself and to dare force it to adjust itself to our inner dream."' 

The concatenation of events that brought Picasso to Gonzalez's cluttered 
working atelier in 1928 included not only his technical needs but probably an 
instinctive need to retreat in the company of an old countryman who, as is always 
stressed, had an equable temperament and a modesty that appealed to Picasso. It was

while working side by side with the superb craftsman that Picasso remarked that he 
had not been so happy since 1912, a year of singular artistic efflorescence in his 
work. But that happiness was also a function of his strong sense that he was forging 
ahead, inventing new approaches to sculptural form. The liberation that he felt 
wielding the torch, and inventing an art "free as smoke," as Rusihol had described 
the iron forger's art. had also been stimulated not only by his association with the 
Surrealists but by the increasingly frequent allusions in the art journals to the iron 
and bronze sculptures ot other and often ancient sculptors. As Rusihol had so pre- 
sciently declared in 1893, "The tendency of most modern art is to drink at primal 
fountains." 1 Just a cursory glance at the art journals of that period indicates how 
very much the "primal" metal sculptures of all eras and cultures preceding the 
Modern epoch were the focus of renewed attention, including such diverse examples 
as wrought-iron animals from Luristan, Iberian pre-Roman heads, and Hispano- 
Arabic elongated, forged-and-hammered figures. 

Finally, there was the Surrealist obsession with the found object, initiated by 
Marcel Duchamp, which by 1928 had been clearly articulated, and which was cer- 
tainly not a foreign idea to Picasso. As early as 19 12. he had used scraps ot found 
materials in his collages and constructions, a practice that Apollinaire wrote about 
in 19 13 in terms ot the human associations evoked by the use of such materials. The 
Surrealists only spurred him to retrieve and develop certain ot his early Cubist ideas. 
Picasso's long history of cutting shapes from cardboard, tin, and burlap in making 
bas-reliefs and sometimes sculpture in the round gave him a head start in his adven- 
ture in Gonzalez's studio. 

In fact, he had turned to Gonzalez even earlier, modeling the singular Cubist 
Head (Fernande) oi 1909 in his friend's studio. Speaking of that work, Picasso later 
told his biographer Roland Penrose: "'I thought the curves you see on the surface 
should continue in the interior. I had the idea of doing them in wire." This solu- 
tion, however, did not please him because, he added, 'It was too intellectual, too 
much like painting. '"" Whether or not this remark was an afterthought, the tact 
remains that his general approach in the early years tended toward the same econo- 
my and use of volume and space found in the iron sculptures from 1928 onward. 
The first work that he did with Gonzalez— the painted construction Head ot 1928 
(cat. no. 26)— with its tripod metal armature and its double-image head, clearly 
derives from paintings of the period. Yet within a tew months, the painterly source 



19 



of his interest was transmuted. Picasso returned to the linear inventions he had once 
only imagined, this time carrying them out with intense concentration on the possi- 
bilities of the technique of assemblage. He had already partially explored this 
approach in such works as the wood construction Mandolin and Clarinet of 19 13, in 
which one of the principal shapes is clearly a leftover from a piece of wood from 
which a curving shape had been sawed out; Bottle of Bass, Glass, and Newspaper of 
19 14, with its curving tin member; and a detailed sketch, a study for a construction 
with a guitar, clearly depicting a three-dimensional sculpture with strings or wires 
for the guitar, and a table or chairs, with legs of zig-zagging planes reminiscent of 
African sculptures. The way Picasso's mind worked even from that period is reflect- 
ed clearly in remarks he made later to Helene Parmehn: 

If I paste three bits of wood on a placard and if I say that that is painting, 
that does not represent freedom— in what way is that freedom? It's making 
something or other with three bits of wood. That has nothing to do with 
freedom. If there is a freedom in that which one makes, it is in the act of 
freeing something in oneself. And even that— that doesn't last. 21 
In Gonzalez's studio, Picasso obviously freed something in himself— for instance, 
the impulse to work out intricate linear spatial games, a thought that had long ago 
occurred to him in the course of his playing the old draftsman's game of drawing a 
single line without lifting the pencil from the paper, as in his numerous 19 18 draw- 
ings of harlequins in simple, open configurations of bent-wirelike lines. Or the 
impulse to whittle down shapes, played out also in the group of slender wood sculp- 
tures carved in 193 1 from what were undoubtedly framing strips that he found 
around the studio. When working on a sculpture, his drive was to use a minimum 
of means to reveal highly suggestive shapes in space, or to let loose the characteristic 
tendency throughout his life to explore the uninhibited realm of the baroque. In 
this too, his Spanish formation certainly figures. In those cafe sessions of his stu- 
dent years, Picasso absorbed the lessons of the poets of Spain's golden age— particu- 
larly Gongora, whom he would later lovingly illustrate. One of Gongora's seven- 
teenth-century admirers, the Jesuit Baltasar Gracian, characterized the Baroque men- 
tality in his Third Discourse: "Uniformity limits, variety expands; and variety is sub- 
limer to the degree that its noble perfections are multiplied.'"' In his iron sculp- 
tures, Picasso took great pleasure in the variety of effects he could achieve by bend- 
ing iron to his formal will, as can be seen step by step. The initial resistance and

eventual ductility of the metal medium stimulated his imagination and, even more, 
enabled him to clarify his unremitting search for the essential sign, the reduction 
that yields imaginative amplification. 

There is not a single sculpture by Picasso that cannot be found announced in 
his drawings. In drawing, he sought the "signs" that he said were the keys to his art. 
"Raphael's image of a woman is only a sign," ;i he said, and "an artist should 
observe nature, but never confuse it with painting. It is only translatable into paint- 
ing by signs."' 1 ' Signs are extreme reductions, and often in Picasso's drawings, the 
human figure and its various parts are reduced to skeletal signs. At the moment he 
was drawn back to Gonzalez's studio, he and many other artists were concerned with 
such reductions. His countryman Joan Miro, for instance, made statements after 
1923 in which the French word depouiller was repeatedly invoked: "to strip down to 
essentials." In Picasso's sketchbooks from the mid-i920s, there are numerous 
stripped-down drawings, including some, called Surrealist, in which the bony arma- 
ture beneath human flesh is all that interests him. The hieroglyphics that were sug- 
gested to him in the course of working iron fortified many artists after him, includ- 
ing Gonzalez, who, as we know from his commentaries on Picasso, watched closely 
and with intelligent analysis while Picasso worked. 

The first few experiments with iron wire were worked out in scores of draw- 
ings that Picasso made in Dinard in the summer of 1928. Here, his initial idea of a 
figure near a beach cabana (which can be seen in paintings of that summer) evolves 
fancifully, looking back to earlier drawings in which he used a syntax of lines and 
dots linked up as in the parlor game, such as his illustrations for "The Unknown 
Masterpiece," and forward to paintings in which the suggestion of distance is made 
by making the sign for a woman's head the mere head of a pin. Looking at the pro- 
gression of drawings over that summer, one sees Picasso seeking the means to fuse 
the figure and its environs (the latter in this case consisting of the horizon and the 
beach cabin}, an old sculptural problem already addressed by Auguste Rodin, 
Medardo Rosso, and Umberto Boccioni. (For the exhibition catalogue for his show 
at the Galerie de la Boetie in 19 13, Boccioni had reprinted his 19 12 "Technical 
Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture," in which he called for the "absolute and complete 
abolition of definite lines and closed sculpture, we break open the figure and 
enclose it in its environment."^ Picasso himself was on the same track, and in 1914 
had produced his Glass of Absinthe, in which the forces of the environment invade 



31 



the heart of the sculpture.) At the same time, the Dinard drawings play around the 
witty vision of the human body as an armature for its house of flesh, and of the 
whole environment as a house within which the body moves. The problem of creat- 
ing an alternative to the usual monotonous base is also addressed, as Picasso sug- 
gests several points of contact for the gravitational pull of the figure, finding decid- 
edly original solutions. 

Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of his solutions to these problems, 
particularly in the 1928 series of wire-sculpture maquettes for a proposed monument 
to Apollinaire, is the way he establishes a three-dimensional frame and thus intro- 
duces a pictorialism of a new order (for which many commentators have criticized 
him). In conventional sculpture there was always the notion of virtual enclosure sug- 
gested by the original quadrature of a block. Here, the intercession of complicated 
planes of perforated space simultaneously breaks the consistency of the quadrature 
and reinforces its inevitable perpetual presence, more or less on the Gestalt principle 
(i.e., where the overall configuration dominates one's attention to individual parts). 
Picasso's interest in preserving an interplay of form is evident in the slight varia- 
tions of certain elements that he makes within this series, modifying the thickness 
of his iron wire and emphasizing or minimizing the slight curves produced in the 
soldered joints. While these sculptures are drawings in space, they are also highly 
complex sculptural evocations of space. The cat's-cradle complications of the draw- 
ings are sustained but clarified by a shaper's hand that unerringly draws out the 
form from line. 

Picasso's initial collaborations with Gonzalez inspired him, and, in works 
completed between 1930 and 1935, in which the use of found materials with their 
inevitable poetic (that is, metaphoric) associations becomes essential, he established 
a modern idiom that has had a lasting influence. One of the most influential sculp- 
tures was Head of Woman of 1929-30 (cat. no. 29), with its flexed legs, as in a 
Bambara or Bakota tribal piece, its prominent use of a found object (the colanders 
that he sent Gonzalez to buy), and its hieroglyphic composite of wire springs and 
shaped metal to represent a rakelike sweep of hair. Widely reproduced, this work 
became the touchstone for countless artists embarking on assembled metal sculpture 
experiments, as did the more flamboyant Woman in a Garden of 1919-1,0 (cat. no. 
28). The latter work, which Picasso hammered and welded without Gonzalez's assis- 
tance, was the first sculpture assembled out of found iron parts of monumental

proportions— some of them almost seven feet high— and the first modern example of 
an environmental sculpture with a playful, and emphatically baroque, character. 
These pieces, which establish a line in the history of Modern sculpture from Picasso 
to Gonzalez to David Smith to Mark di Suvero and onward, could never have been 
realized without the unique contribution of Gonzalez, who himself carried a line 
from Barcelona to Paris and back again to Spain in the works of Eduardo Chillida 
and others. That line can only be traced if the importance of iron as a medium— 
and its variant, steel— is acknowledged. 

It was not only Rusihol who envisioned the possibilities. Paul Gauguin, in his 
notes on the Universal Exposition of 1889, called it "the triumph of iron," and his 
intuition concerning the tectonic and modern adaptability of iron has some bearing 
on Picasso's innovations in the medium: 

To the architect-engineer belongs a new decorative art, such as ornamental 

bolts, iron corners extending beyond the main line, a sort of gothic lacework 

of iron. . . . Imitation bronze statues clash alongside iron. Always imitation! 

Better to have monsters of bolted iron. 2S 

Gauguin's vision of such monsters came into being in the more violent imagery of 

some of Picasso's 193 1 sculptures and heralded works by artists such as Smith and 

Richard Stankiewicz. 

Gonzalez and the iron arabesque 

Gonzalez, who was fifty-two years old when Picasso engaged his services, was a 
thoughtful craftsman who had lent his skills to others to earn his bread, and had 
long harbored ambitions as a painter. Occasionally he had undertaken sculptural 
projects, but they were usually reliefs, or masks that grew directly out of his work as 
an ornamental ironworker. Without the experience of working side by side with 
Picasso, perhaps he would never have succeeded in liberating his latent talents as a 
major sculptor. Yet, as the American sculptor Smith wrote in a genial article on 
Gonzalez, "The technical collaboration made neither change nor influence in the 
conception of either artist. During the several years it existed, each pursued his own 
work in his own way."" 

What Picasso undoubtedly did teach Gonzalez was the value of the large ges- 
ture, the free-spirited play of the bricoleur, and the role of chance in experimental 



33 



work. Where things are concerned, Picasso used to say, there are no class distinc- 
tions. With his fellow artist's entrance into his studio, Gonzalez's lifelong habits as a 
meticulous craftsman, drawing objects in precise detail, cutting them from sheets of 
iron, and carefully welding them in seamless perfection, were disrupted critically. In 
complying with Picasso's needs, Gonzalez discovered his own, and found the means 
to realize them not only through his own technical expertise but by giving free rein 
to his innate sculptural intelligence. 

Gonzalez was well aware of the sculptural ideas born in the new century's 
first decades and, in general, with the Modernist discussions animating Paris ever 
since he had arrived at the turn of the century. He had watched Picasso during the 
crucial Cubist years, and he had also learned from others, including Constantin 
Brancusi, for whom he worked during the 1920s, perhaps building armatures. His 
friendship with Torres-Garcia, the Uruguayan artist who had studied in Barcelona 
alongside the Gonzalez brothers, and had worked with Antoni Gaudi, was resumed 
when Torres-Garcia settled in Pans in 1924. Torres-Garcia was immensely gregarious 
and knew artists in many circles in Paris. The well-frequented Saturday afternoon 
gatherings in his studio brought Gonzalez into contact with many spirited artists 
who were filled with energetic visions of aesthetic change. It was in Torres-Garcia's 
studio in 1929 that the plans for the group Cercle et Carre were formed, and, 
although it was to be committed to the basic idea of "structure and abstraction," 
and some of the members were passionate and intolerant Neo-Plasticists, the pres- 
ence of Arp, Georges Vantongerloo, and Torres-Garcia himself assured fruitful dif- 
ferences. In fact, it was during this period that Torres-Garcia began to work with 
pre-Columbian symbols, breaking with the rigorous non-objective principles of 
some of his colleagues. 

The big discussion in those days hinged on the concept of space, which had 
already altered significantly during the first decades of the century. Since Paul 
Cezanne (and theoretically at least, since the Romantic period in the nineteenth 
century), space was not only perceived as a continuum through which matter articu- 
lated itself, but as almost a material in itself that could be shaped within a created 
work. Gonzalez, as his statements make clear, was much preoccupied with the issue 
of space, approaching it from his long experience as a draftsman. Space became his 
partner. When he spoke of stars as points in the infinite, he conceived of them as 
points to be linked by means of "drawing in space." As a draftsman, he knew that 



34 



his hand sought points in space and a virtual axis in which to establish the compo- 
sition, and from which to abstract the illusion of something now closer, now more 
distant from the perceiver. His "marriage of material and space" by the "union of 
real forms with imaginary forms, obtained and suggested by established points, or 
by perforation" grew directly from the abstracting process every draftsman knows. 
When he discovered that he could translate those "established points" into his 
beloved material, iron, Gonzalez discovered himself, just as Plato's child student dis- 
covered geometry. 

The work of Gonzalez's maturity, beginning around 1930, is often said to 
have introduced a new syntax, but probably his great strength lay not so much in 
changing syntax as in finding a fresh means to extend a long sculptural tradition. 
He did not linger with the Cubist planar vision, although his earliest experiments 
with cutting sheet iron around 1927 began there. Rather, he reached back to retrieve 
the character of sculpture-in-the-round developed during the Renaissance, but with 
new means. In his most compelling works, such as Woman Combing Her Hair (ca. 
193 1 ), the torsion is carefully calculated. Almost all of the larger works thereafter are 
conceived according to the contrapposto principle: Nothing is permitted to rest on a 
single plane; everything is contrived to turn in space, drawing space into itself 
through shaped perforations that constantly move. In his total integration of the 
surrounding space and his avoidance of frontality, Gonzalez, as Margit Rowell has 
argued, advanced Modern sculpture perhaps even more than Picasso. 5 ' 

And in Gonzalez's own eyes, his means were derived from a great tradition, 

which he wanted to extend. His companion in the workshop, Picasso, was in his 

own way a great traditionalist, and the two shared the sensual pleasures in cutting 

into the slabs of iron and, by means of fire, forcing them into new configurations, 

both knowing the venerable artistic history of their material. Gonzalez, who was 

religious, knew the history of ironsmithing back to the Old Testament at least, in 

which the prophet Jeremiah used the metaphor of iron as "stubbornly defiant" to 

describe his people." To use this hallowed material as a means of "drawing in space" 

was a challenge to both artists. Tucker has captured the excitement of metalworking: 

The seed of Picasso's original Cubist constructions in wood bore fruit in steel 

in the hand of Gonzalez: not only the assembly part by part, but the previous 

and separate shaping of parts— bar forged, drawn or bent, sheet rolled, cut or 

folded, volumes made by the enclosure of the void: the component thus 



35 



made, joined at points and edges, and situated in relation to gravity in ways 

inaccessible to the traditional materials of sculpture." 
Gonzalez often returned to the carved slab of iron, which he had begun cutting, 
bending, and shaping in the reliefs of 1929. He extended his technique with a varia- 
tion of Picasso's painterly conception of The Kiss (ca. 1930), which in its frontality, 
its clear superposition of planes, and curvilinear wire definition harks back to 
Gonzalez's decorative masks of the mid-to-late 1920s. Eventually, as in Head Called 
"The Swiss Woman" of 1932 (cat. no. 39), he drew out the most expressive possibility 
of suggested massive volumes with minimal manipulation of the sheet of metal. 

The great challenge for both artists lay in the mastery of the process itself, 
which entailed both careful imagining beforehand and improvisation in the event. 
Just as etching had intrigued Picasso, not in the least because it had to be imagined 
in stages and in reverse as well, so he became engaged in this process of working 
piece by piece, hammering, cutting, and torching. Gonzalez must have been aston- 
ished at first by Picasso's way of surveying the studio and finding scraps that could 
be bent to his will. Postage stamps and bits of tin cans were one thing, iron another. 
What Gonzalez learned about free association from Picasso during those long hours 
together in the studio was augmented by the art talk of the period. It was a time 
when the Surrealists were demonstrating the evocative power of fragments, and 
reproducing in their magazines the strange objects they turned up in the flea mar- 
ket. And it was also a time when, in other quarters, there was a lot of talk about 
truth to materials and about direct carving, for which Brancusi was the revered 
model. Gonzalez might have felt a special kinship with Brancusi when he cut into 
his iron sheets and followed the internal demands of the metal he knew so well. 

During the few years Picasso collaborated with him, Gonzalez was assembling 
his working principles and his essential vocabulary. After The Kiss, Gonzalez began 
to weld disparate, sometimes found bars or rods, together with cut-out shapes, as he 
had seen Picasso do in Woman in a Garden. He refined his execution (Picasso was 
not concerned with the elegance of the weld, or the discreet polish of a single part), 
and began to stress the arabesque, an abstract tendency quite foreign to Picasso. He 
also experimented with semienclosed shapes, as in Head Called "The Tunnel" (cat. 
no. 41), with its plays on dark and light of an entirely new character. Then, toward 
the mid-i930s, Gonzalez developed an alternate way to use his materials by joining 
several slabs together to create hollow, boxlike volumes, as in Seated Woman I (cat. 



36 



no. 53). (Rowell attributes this new concept to his encounter with Alberto Magnelli, 
who, during the mid-i93os, was working with the imagery of split and piled stones.) 
In a sculpture of around 1935, Large Standing Figure (cat. no. 50), he returned to the 
iron rod, making a magisterial drawing in space in which the wrought-iron tradition 
of Spain found its modern fulfillment. Countless artists drew inspiration from the 
elements of Gonzalez's practice between 1930 and 1935, and it was certainly 
Gonzalez's adherence to abstract principles that made his work viable for others. 
Around 1930, he stated: 

A painter or sculptor can give a form to something which has no concrete 
form: such as light, color, and idea. These forms will of course be imagined 
in reference to the human image. Difficult problems to be solved posed by 
these reinvented planes creating a new architecture.' 4 
Such difficult problems called up all his inventive resources. What he learned from 
Picasso was important, but so was his dialogue with Torres-Garcia, who believed that 
the human spirit could be conveyed through color, line, and form, spoke of the tra- 
dition of "Abstract Man," and believed, as he said to numerous acquaintances, that 
art was in a profound crisis and a moment of transition. Torres-Garcfa's concerns 
reinforced Gonzalez's focus on the translation of abstract ideas of color and light, 
their references to the human image, and the tectonics involved as the primary 
issues that would find resolution in his sculpture of the 1930s. 

The idea of the primacy of the material was not an ideological position for 
Gonzalez as it was for so many others, but rather grew from his long experience 
with metal, an obdurate material compared with clay or plaster. There are only so 
many things that can be done with iron or steel. It can be cut, bent, forged, and sol- 
dered, and it almost always resists surface embellishment. The impetus for this new 
genre of sculpture came from Gonzalez's recognition of the nature of his material, 
as well as his romantic temperament, which, in its idealizing tendency, was attracted 
to the abstract— to the arabesque, which had assumed such mystical importance ever 
since the Symbolist movement. In a way, this aligned him more with Matisse than 
Picasso. Irrespective of any influence or affinity, however, it was Gonzalez who 
determined the idiom that so many since have explored, and he did it with a bold- 
ness and a subtlety rarely seen since. The Dream, The Kiss (cat. no. 46), for instance, 
is composed around an invisible vertical axis from which dilate just a few well- 
defined forms that nonetheless give the impression of complexity. The cup-shaped 



37 



node of forged, rounded elements is echoed in the crownlike, open shape, to which 
Gonzalez has appended only the three strands of Hying hair (an image he borrowed 
from Picasso and never relinquished) to indicate that it represents a head. At the 
crest of the major rod, another cluster of shapes suggests a hand. The sculpture's 
verticality insists on anthropomorphic identification, and the signs for hair and 
hand support this reading; but, as many commentators have noted, what ultimately 
gives the sculpture its expressive character is the naked beauty of the material, 
wrought formally with consummate skill. 

Gonzalez was at his best when he made the simplest, most linear sculptures in 
the period after Picasso had left the studio. Around 1934 he created one of his most 
splendid works, Mane of Hair (cat. no. 49), perhaps inspired by Charles Baudelaire's 
superb poem with the same title. Here, the forged arc surmounted by the strands of 
flying hair engulfs a beautifully rounded volume of space, while thrusting itself with 
great abandon into the space around it. Probably that same year, he made a variant, 
Woman with a Mirror, which, for all its classical figural elements (the bottle-shaped 
neck quite evidently represents a neck) is more of an abstraction, one could say, of a 
classical bust in the round. Sometimes, Gonzalez fashions the finest, most tantaliz- 
ing space, as in the nearly abstract Forme tres fine of 1937 (cat. no. 59) and in several 
other pieces, by leaving infinitesimal space between two cut, flat planes of iron, to 
articulate a sense of rising movement. These narrowed apertures, joined ever so 
lightly by visible welds, are characteristic of his mature work, and distinguish his 
work from that of his imitators. Even in works such as Seated Woman 1, with its 
enclosed volumes, Gonzalez leaves small apertures between forms, opening his 
sculpture to crosscurrents of space; and at the same time, he calls attention to the 
innate beauty of the metal and the elegance with which he has married the edges of 
parts with his torch. Smith may have thought that "craft and smithery became sub- 
merged in the concept of sculpture" in Gonzalez's mature period, but, in fact, what 
made Gonzalez's unexpected concept of sculpture singular was his second sense, 
acquired through years of smithery. 



From universe to universal 

Gonzalez began one of his published notes with a reference to "the age of iron," 
which, he said, began many centuries ago when iron was first used to produce beau- 
tiful objects but, unfortunately, was used thereafter mostly for making arms and, 
eventually, bridges and railroads. "It is time this metal ceased to be a murderer and 
the simple instrument of a supermechanical science," he declared, urging that it be 
"forged and hammered by the peaceful hands of an artist."" Gonzalez's age of iron, 
with its implicit denial of the machine-age aesthetic and its contempt for superme- 
chanical science, was a very different iron age from that envisioned by two 
Americans, Alexander Calder and Smith, who made iron and steel their province. 
Both had a healthy respect for industrial materials, were familiar with factory tech- 
niques, and had a keen interest in the sciences. However, neither of them had for- 
mulated an approach to his art as assured as those of seasoned artists such as 
Picasso or Gonzalez, who had had Beaux-Arts training and had shared the cultural 
milieu of Paris for thirty years. 

American artists in general, during the 1920s and 1930s, had had to contrive 
their artistic culture from a variety of sources, most of them secondhand from 
Europe, and thus often suffered from an uneasy sense of colonial inferiority. They 
suspected that Art was born in Europe, and that it continued to flourish there, and 
only there. So, during the 1920s, hundreds of expatriate Americans thronged boule- 
vard cafes in Paris and hungrily sought the secrets of the Modern masters. They 
craved to get the feel of things as simple as what a "real" artist's studio looked like, 
and how artists really lived in the great and fabled bohemia that they had read 
about. Many had seen examples of European avant-garde art in New York exhibi- 
tions, and had seen magazine reproductions of it, but it was important to experi- 
ence the ambience of an authentic artistic center— something New York had so far 
never succeeded in establishing. They came determined to feast at the grand buffet, 
and in many ways found it easier to ingest the various tendencies than expatriate 
Europeans, who often arrived in Paris with a more formed ideological interest in 
avant-garde tendencies. 

Calder, who was by nature gregarious, found it simple to move from one 
milieu to another in Paris, and never really felt the need to take an aesthetic posi- 
tion in a sharply defined way. He seemed to wander about from studio to studio at 



39 



random, taking inspiration where he found it and picking up ideas that were, as 
they used to say, in the air. He was relatively innocent of the tensions that led to 
skirmishes between Cubists, Constructivists, and Surrealists, and was in a far better 
position than they to make a singular synthesis of their artistic convictions. In addi- 
tion, the peculiarities of his own artistic formation shielded him from the peril of 
becoming just a second-generation epigone. The son and grandson of established 
and rather academic sculptors, Calder was not unduly awed by notions of bohemia, 
having known an American version in his own home through which various and 
sometimes eccentric American artists passed. His early mechanical aptitude had 
brought him to the Stevens Institute of Technology, one of America's leading engi- 
neering schools, where he completed his studies as a mechanical engineer before 
deciding to study art. He tumbled into art school in a rather casual way, where he 
studied mainly with his parents' friend John Sloan, a political radical and artistic 
aesthete, whose lessons were not completely lost on Calder. Certainly Sloan's insis- 
tence that his students should master contour-line drawing was vital to Calder's later 
work. Joan Marter quotes excerpts from student notes taken in Sloan's classes, in 
which Sloan describes line as "entirely a sign, a mental invention,""' and declares, in 
another passage, "An ideograph is better than the thing itself. A better work of art 
tries to say the thing rather than be the thing itself." 1 " Calder carried this ideograph- 
ic notion of line into his wire sculptures of the late 1920s. 

It is true that at the Art Students League, where Calder was a student from 
1923 to 1925, the emphasis on contour-line drawing was derived as much from 
Rodin and Matisse, and perhaps even Picasso, as it was from the teachings of the 
older generation of American realists; and it is even possible that Picasso's whimsical 
single-line drawings of clowns and harlequins of 19 18, which look like prototypes of 
Calder's earlier wire-line caricatures, were known to Calder and his classmates. Still, 
the bias of most instructors toward realist illustration was probably the strongest ele- 
ment in Calder's training. Even at that early stage, however, the European orienta- 
tion was not completely absent, for it appeared in Calder's life in the person of 
John Graham, the mysterious Russian cavalryman who, after a sojourn in Paris, 
turned up as a fellow student at the Art Students League. Graham was an exact con- 
temporary of Picasso and was therefore an eminence grise for his much younger class- 
mates, who listened with wonder to his tales of Europe and Russia and his eclectic 
theories of art. (Another Russian very much in view during Calder's student years 



40 



was Alexander Archipenko, who had arrived in 1923 and lost no time establishing 
himself as a teacher of avant-garde sculpture, a rare anomaly in America, where art 
schools were still moored in conventional approaches.) 

In June 1926, Calder followed several of his classmates, including the irre- 
pressible Graham, to Paris, where, like most other foreigners, he went to sketch class- 
es at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere. By all accounts, that summer the twen- 
ty-eight-year-old Calder behaved more like a dilettante vacationer, sampling the 
delights of cafe life and making the most of chance encounters with the rather large 
international community then inhabiting Montparnasse. Often the behavior of the 
Americans, who were taking advantage or the extremely favorable exchange of francs 
and dollars during the mid-to-late 1920s, is described, somewhat denigratingly, as 
pragmatic. In reality, their attitude was identical to the attitudes of the other foreign 
artists who congregated in Paris during the years before the great stock-market crash 
of 1929: They had a language problem. They were unfamiliar with the small but sig- 
nificant differences in mores. They had to make their way among different factions 
without the security of knowing the origins of various ideological quarrels. And like 
all foreigners, they were always regarded by the indigenous artists as naive, at the 
very least. Even such major figures as Vasily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian were fre- 
quently seen as foreign to the French way of thinking, and lived, as did the 
Americans, at the margin of the French art world. The consequence was that the for- 
eign contingent got to know each other quickly, and tended to help newcomers find 
their way around. Calder, during his first short sojourn that summer of 1926, 
immediately met the English-speaking Stanley William Hayter, who had arrived a 
few months before from London, and who was already acquainted with several sig- 
nificant artists of the international avant-garde. Hayter had a lot in common with 
Calder. He was a scientist, trained in geology and chemistry, and worked profession- 
ally as a chemist in England before he threw it all in for a career as an artist. This 
common piofessional background was important in Calder's evolution. When 
Calder returned for a longer stay in Paris the following fall, he also met the Spanish 
sculptor Jose de Creeft, whose studio he often visited, and where he first saw forged- 
iron works by Gargallo. 

According to Calder, during his first years in Paris he thought of himself as a 
painter. Others saw him as an amusing humorist— good fun and an original. His 
experiments with toys with movable parts, which he began in 1926, and his single- 



41 



line wire sculptures, such as the caricature of cabaret singer Josephine Baker, were 
viewed as refreshing and entertaining, as was the early version of his circus begun in 
1927. He was the beneficiary of a discernible fad in Pans, where Americans from 
Baker to Calder himself were regarded as exotic and exciting. But it must be added 
that the growing sense of malaise in the Parisian intellectual world also led to a seri- 
ous interest in the fruits of an extremely different culture. "I wonder if America 
realizes what artistique France is expecting of her," wrote the important critic Andre 
Salmon, in an introduction to a Graham exhibition catalogue in 1929. Salmon, an 
intimate of Picasso and Apollinaire, pointed to the example of Walt Whitman 
"restoring Homeric lyricism to our worn-out naturalism," and said that Graham 
"has struck us as a double and simultaneous phenomenon of assimilation and 
transposition. . . . This painter, away from our midst, deriving so to speak from . . . 
cubism . . . already restores it to us, at the same time purified and enlarged." ; 

Assimilation and transposition: Calder was a master at assimilation, having 
exposed himself in many studios to experiences that often represented contrasting 
artistic values. Through Hayter, who opened his etching studio Atelier 17 in late 
1927, he encountered a great many Surrealists, including Eluard, Arp, and Yves 
Tanguy, and probably also Kandinsky, whom Hayter (and Graham) deeply admired. 
Hayter's point of view was deeply influenced by his Surrealist friends as well as by 
the Russian master whose radical vision of space he would faithfully follow. It may 
be that Calder's initial experiments with mobile elements were informed by Hayter's 
assimilation of Kandinsky's principles. Hayter summarized his views throughout the 
prewar years in a lecture in which Kandinsky's ideas prevail: 

There is a certain development in art, generally known as non-objective, 
which can be seen in the early works of Kandinsky, where there is still a static 
frame of reference but things are sometimes set up which appear to be in 
motion, not in the sense of successive displacements as with the Futurists, but 
themselves moving and involved with elements of speed and time. . . . The 
dimension of time— the fourth dimension— was added to the dimension of 
space."' 

Calder continued to travel back and forth between New York and Paris for 
several years. In the fall of 1928, he rented a studio in Paris, for a stay of a year and 
a half. It was in 1928 that he met Miro, visited his studio, and began his lifelong 
friendship with the older artist. Miro took pleasure in encouraging Calder to settle

down to explore more ambitious avenues, and probably shared with Calder his 
enthusiasm for Paul Klee. Miro's interest in primitive art, his sense of whimsy, and 
his great appreciation for folk art, particularly hand-carved toys, provided the 
grounds lor a real friendship. After a return visit to New York, from lune 1929 to 
March 1930, Calder took another studio in Paris. Six months later he had a second 
important encounter, which he always maintained provided the shock that brought 
him to abstract art: his visit to Mondrian's apartment-studio in October 1930. He 
was smitten not so much by Mondrian's paintings— although he quickly adopted the 
older master's habit of limiting his palette to the primary colors and black and 
white— as by the radiant ambience of the carefully arranged studio, in which 
Mondrian had tacked rectangles of red, yellow, and blue to his white walls. 

It would be hard to attribute Calder's sudden swerve away from literal depic- 
tion to any particular influence, but there were several curious cultural conjunctions 
and historical facts that might be cited. The Great Depression into which America 
was sliding had its impact in Europe as well, making for an unusually anxious state 
of mind that subsisted until the outbreak of World War II. From the chorus of 
laments over the general aesthetic confusion that had begun in the mid-i920s, sever- 
al voices emerged forcefully from different camps. The Surrealists and the 
Constructivists were both vociferously declaring their belief in the value of science, 
but with very different tones of voice. When Breton, for instance, published his 
novel Nadja in 1928, he included a photograph of a strange ob]ect he had found in 
a flea market that had set him off on the quest for mathematical models at the 
Poincare Institute. That object, so mysterious in its irregular shape and network of 
lines, was thought to be a three-dimensional model of a population graph. Breton 
and his friends saw these models of scientific thought as an affirmation of the fan- 
tastic depths of the human imagination. However, Calder's friends among the 
Parisian Constructivists saw scientific paradigms as the necessary accompaniment of 
a progressiva, non-objective art that they regarded as parallel to modern science. 
Among the many Europeans who moved to Paris in the 1930s, there were artists 
who were descendants of both Dada and the initial De Stijl principles, such as van 
Doesburg and his close friend Arp; others who had witnessed the abstract, often 
machine-oriented constructions undertaken in the Bauhaus; and still others who 
knew the original Russian avant-garde that, like Vladimir Tatlin, had drawn quasi- 
scientific principles from Picasso's initial experiments with Cubist structures. Calder 



43 



soon came into contact with most of these artists, as well as the French painters 
Robert Delaunay and Jean Helion, when he joined Abstraction-Creation in the win- 
ter of 19^1. That same winter he embarked on his career as an innovative abstract 
sculptor in metal. 

By the time an exhibition of Calder's abstract sculpture opened at the Galerie 
Percier in April 1931, Paris had seen the works of several artists who had begun to 
work with open-form metal construction. Calder's friend Isamu Noguchi, who had 
worked in Brancusi's atelier, was experimenting with sheet-brass, curving it and cut- 
ting it into irregular free-form shapes that recalled the biomorphic shapes used by 
both Arp and Miro during that period. Transparency as a sculptural value was 
increasingly discussed by critics, and works by well-known sculptors such as Jacques 
Lipchitz and Henri Laurens demonstrated the principle in the late 1920s. But 
Calder's exhibition struck a particular chord, especially the delicate wire construc- 
tions grouped under the title "Volumes - Vectors - Densities" (which Calder was 
showing together with "Drawings and Portraits" in wire). For the catalogue, his 
friend Fernand Leger— whom he had also met in 1930— wrote that Calder's whimsy 
had released him from Neo-Plasticism, permitting him to create works in which 
"the wire became taut, geometric, perfectly embodying the plastic in art, the present 
time, deliberate anti-romanticism dominated by a striving for equilibrium." 40 

Leger may have approved of the "objective" and antiromantic attitude he saw 
in Calder's new works, but Calder himself had ambitions that were quite in keeping 
with romanticism, especially the imaginative variety that his friend Miro incorporat- 
ed into his paintings of stars and planets in the cosmos, which he rendered, as had 
Klee, as simple circles floating in space. Calder himself spoke of the group of works 
he called "Universes" as having some kind of universal or cosmic feeling, and in a 
talk many years later, in 195 1, spoke seriously of the underlying motifs that he had 
established in 1930 and never abandoned: "The underlying sense of form in my 
work has been the system of the universe, or part thereof. For this is a rather large 
model to work from."" Earlier, he had given a statement for the Abstraction- 
Creation almanac of 1932, in which he opened with the rhetorical question: how 
does art come into being? He answered: 

Out of the volumes, motion, spaces carved out within the surrounding space, 
the universe. . . . Out of directional line— vectors representing motion, 
velocity, acceleration, energy, etc. . . . Spaces and volumes created by the

slightest opposition to their mass, or penetrated by vectors, traversed by 
momentum. None of this is fixed. Each element can move, shift, or sway 
back and forth in a changing relation to each of the other elements in this 
universe. 4 ' 

In the Galerie Percier exhibition, Calder showed experiments with delicate 
linear wire structures, so slender that they would vibrate to the footsteps of visitors. 
The empty circles of bent wire were punctuated with tiny wooden spheres, attached 
so as to almost suggest the sound of a small clapper. Marter notes that Calder had 
been fascinated as a child by what he called eighteenth-century toys demonstrating 
the planetary system, and suggests convincingly that these new abstract metaphors 
for the universe may have been suggested by mechanical orreries such as the 
Copernican armillary sphere. 4 ' In any case, the works of 1932 led directly to Calder's 
early experiments with kinetic pieces, at first achieved by attaching rudimentary 
machinery— a simple motor drive or hand crank— and later, using only gravity and 
wind to move the elements. In 1932, he created several works, dubbed by Duchamp 
"mobiles," in which the element of random movement is utilized to achieve a shift- 
ing equilibrium. Calder, who seemed to have been interested in Mondnan's discus- 
sions of dynamic equilibrium, described his own Object with Red Discs (also known 
as Calderberry Bush, cat. no. 67) in similar terms. He said that he suspended a two- 
meter rod with one heavy sphere from the apex of a wire, giving the cantilever 
effect, and that five thin aluminum disks, projecting at right angles, were held in 
position by a wooden sphere counterweight. The effect was that when one of the 
red-painted aluminum pieces was lightly touched, the entire sculpture became ani- 
mated, quivering and slightly shifting in space. From such initial experiments it was 
a short step to the hanging mobile that Calder developed later in the 1930s, in 
which he achieved the lyrical expression of the universe that he had sought since 
1930. Calder's achievement in introducing an aleatory principle in sculpture has 
been compared to the achievements of avant-garde composers, among them Edgar 
Varese (who also created a composition he called Density 21. 5). It is certainly the 
source of most kinetic sculpture ever since, ranging from Takis to Pol Bury. 

Toward the late 1930s, Calder began to work with more fantastic shapes, prob- 
ably encouraged by his closer relationships with various Surrealist artists. Here he 
revealed his affinities with Gonzalez and Picasso, bending large sheets of iron or 
steel, cutting them into billowing, twisting shapes, and bolting them together, proto- 



45 



types of the huge public, bolted stabiles (aptly described by Gauguin's phrase "bolt- 
ed monsters") that he began making after World War II. These works were shown in 
New York in 19^7, and called "stabiles." In Paris that spring, Calder visited Miro, 
who brought him to meet the architects ol the 1937 World's Fair Spanish Pavilion, 
for which he, Gonzalez, and Picasso were preparing works. Calder, who maintained 
friendships with several important members or Paris's Spanish colony, and whose 
politics were always to the left, volunteered his services, and when a Spanish artist 
who had been asked to create a mercury fountain defaulted, Josep Lluis Sert asked 
Calder to take his place. In many ways this extraordinary collaboration can be seen 
as the culmination of the American's long interaction with Spanish artists— a 
moment when the torch that passed from Picasso to Gonzalez was handed to the 
New World. American ingenuity, ambivalently admired and despised by Europeans, 
became, in a mercurial flash, something essential. The drive to conquer new materi- 
als, going back to the earliest decade of the century, found its ultimate expression in 
Calder's harnessing the volatile and dense substance mercury to produce not only 
movement, but new relationships of color and tone. No doubt it was a great and 
symbolic satisfaction both for Calder and his American colleagues to see in all the 
photographs of the Spanish Pavilion, Picasso's epoch-making Guernica behind the 
Mercury Fountain. 

David Smith "there where the others art not" 

Calder had left the Art Students League in 1925, a year before Smith arrived in New 
York. By the fall of 1927, Smith was a full-time student at the League, where he too 
learned from Sloan ("I got anarchy and cubes from John Sloan""). But within a 
year, the Czech-born painter Jan Matulka was teaching at the league, where he 
imbued a whole generation of painters with the principles of European Cubism, 
talked to them about Kandinsky, and urged upon his students an attitude of explo- 
ration that Smith always maintained had been crucial to his development as an 
artist. In 1929, Alfred H. Barr, Jr. inaugurated the Museum of Modern Art, giving 
New York its first coherent series of exhibitions documenting the Modern move- 
ment. That same year, Smith met Graham, who by that time had become a signifi- 
cant figure in the avant-garde art world of New York at least partly because, as the 
agent ol frank Crowninshield, a collector of primitive art, Graham was able to visit 



46 



Paris frequently and could bring back the news of the great world to his eager young 
acolytes. Through Graham, Smith met others of his own generation, such as Willem 
de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, as well as the older Stuart Davis, all of whom, like 
him, were avid for news from the French capital and open to all the shifting winds. 

Smith often recalled Graham's essential contribution to his own development. 
One of the important aspects of Graham's influence lay in his broad intellectual 
interests and his insistence that his younger friends keep up with both the literary 
and art journals of the sophisticated international world. Naturally, these included 
Cahiers d'art, in which Smith saw Picasso's works regularly (he tore out the pages of 
a 1929 issue reproducing Picasso's Projects for Monuments and always kept them), and 
later Minotaure. But there was also transition, in which Smith first encountered the 
work of James Joyce, who would remain a primary source of inspiration. While it is 
true that the reproductions of works by Picasso and, especially, Gonzalez, were the 
fundamental catalysts in Smith's formation as a sculptor, Joyce contributed to that 
which was unique to Smith: his surging emotional, almost dianstic attitude toward 
his work, and his stubborn insistence on the painterly foundation for his life's work. 
The Joycean stress on free association and wordplay— so adaptable to collage, for 
instance— suited his temperament. When, during his mature years, Smith wrote of 
his work, he often alluded to Joyce, and sometimes, in his diction, there are imita- 
tions of Joyce's approach: 

Rarely the Grand Conception, but a preoccupation with parts. I start with 
one, then a unit of parts, until a whole appears. Parts have unities and associ- 
ations and separate afterimages— even when they are no longer parts but a 
whole. The afterimages of parts lie back on the horizon, very distant cousins 
to the image formed by the finished work." 

By 1932, when Smith probably made his first welded works, the rudiments of 
his approach to sculpture were already in place. But its full evolution followed an 
erratic course in which the fact that "Mondrian, cubism, constructivism and surreal- 
ism all came on me at one time, without my even knowing the difference between 
them" 4 '' sometimes undermined the clarity of his conceptions, and led him occa- 
sionally into rather banal experiments. Yet, like his friends, who were all painters, 
Smith benefited from the aesthetic diversity and general absence of partisanship 
enjoyed by New York artists. That liberal atmosphere lasted until the depths of the 
mid-1950s, when the Depression, with its unique by-product of federally sponsored 



47 



art projects, brought forth a strong social demand for realist (and nationalist) art. At 
that point, Smith, along with other progressive artists— including his friends de 
Kooning, Gorky, Jean Xceron, Davis, and Adolph Gottlieb, to mention just a few- 
became fervent standard-bearers of Modernism, which was under attack. Smith later 
wrote that "belligerent vitality and conviction" 1 were, along with affection, the 
attributes of the creative artist. His own belligerent vitality was immense, even dur- 
ing those confused years when so many artists felt torn between their vaguely social- 
ist or anarchist political convictions and their fundamental belief in the formal, 
ahistorical values of Modern art. 

During the mid-to-late 1930s, American artists who were otherwise deeply 
committed to the Modern tradition were, through circumstances, drawn into the 
problems of society at large. The new emphasis on the virtues of the working class, 
and on the need of some of the masses for art, deeply affected young artists. The 
myth of the machine was revived, and many artists, among them Smith, vaunted 
their earthy experiences in which they encountered the working man. Smith had 
spent a summer holiday as a welder and riveter in an automobile plant when he was 
nineteen years old, and later worked in a factory that produced tanks and locomo- 
tives during the war. His pride in being an equal with skilled workers never abated. 
When he found the Terminal Iron Works workshop in Brooklyn in 1932 and rented 
a corner of it near the forge, he rejoiced in his ability to get on with the workers; 
later, in 1950, he even made a sculpture in homage to one of the owners, an Irish 
blacksmith named Blackburn (cat. no. in). (Smith was not alone in developing the 
manly image of the working American artist, consciously adopted as a contrast to 
the elegance of the European tradition: Jackson Pollock always insisted on his work- 
ing-class origins and experiences, as did Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, and others.) 

Many commentators have connected the Abstract Expressionists' radical 
departure from European sources with the generally pragmatic attitudes of 
Americans and their long habituation to advanced technology and skyscraper cul- 
ture; but a more specific source of the sweeping, open gestures, the desire for large- 
scale or monumental images, and the adventurous bravura was the conflict spawned 
during the Depression. That was the first time that modern American artists felt 
acknowledged as legitimate members of society, at least insofar as government spon- 
sorship legitimized them. But many of them, while maintaining their aggressive 
Modernism, also felt a wistful need to function with the muscled power, the swag-

gering gait of the worker as he was idealized during that brief flirtation with social- 
ism. Leger's visit to New York in the mid-1950s was a great success in large measure 
because his modern idiom was adapted to social ideals, couched in terms of "sci- 
ence-organized-by-society" socialism. As brief as this phase was, it left a lasting mark 
on Smith who, in his last years, produced some of his most extraordinary works in 
Italy in an abandoned factory at Voltri. There, side by side with skilled Italian iron- 
workers, he felt at home; it was, as he said, the nearest thing to a socialist experience 
in his life. 48 

The situation of Smith and his generation during the late 1930s was certainly 
as intellectually tumultuous as that of the artists in Paris, but there was one signifi- 
cant difference: New York had the Museum of Modern Art, in which Barr was com- 
piling the first overview of the century's diverse artistic heritage. In the signal year 
of 1936, Barr presented two epoch-making exhibitions organized on broad interna- 
tional lines: Cubism and Abstract Art followed by Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism. 
Both exhibitions had immediate effects on the work of the younger New York 
artists. But Cubism and Abstract Art was perhaps more influential, for in the show 
and in the catalogue— which made its way into virtually every studio— Barr managed 
not only to gather works from many countries, but to touch upon every single twen- 
tieth-century avant-garde tendency, and even to acknowledge the importance of the 
young by including works by Calder and Alberto Giacometti. Barr noted the new 
tendency toward nongeometric abstraction, talked about "abstract biomorphic" and 
"abstract expressionist" approaches, and in general tried to bring together diverse 
views under the rubric of abstraction. As a result, American artists found that they 
could work more freely, drawing upon whatever resources they felt an affinity for, 
without being mired in ideological campaigns. 

When Smith began his initial experiments with welding around 1932-33, he 
still thought of himself as a painter. His work reflected the popularity of Picasso's 
Synthetic Cubist approach among artists he associated with, especially Davis, Gorky, 
and Graham, who de Kooning said were so close that they were called the Three 
Musketeers. These three ringleaders prided themselves on their free adaptations of 
European styles, and tended to include local allusions to real places and real things 
in their paintings. Picasso was very much with the American painters of the 1930s, 
not only through reproductions in magazines but also experienced directly through 
the inclusion of his work in various exhibitions. One truly catalytic painting, The 



49 



Studio (1927-28, cat. no. 19), had been seen in reproduction within months of its 
creation and, in 1935, entered the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. 
Smith kept a close watch on Picasso, and inspired by the issue of Cahiers d'art in 
which Picasso's wire sculptures had been reproduced, began his intermittent experi- 
ments with welded and forged sculpture. 

Smith often traced his own evolution for interviewers, always stressing the 
presence first of Picasso and then of Gonzalez in his imagination, and adding that 
he was a painter for whom the canvas eventually became the ground for sculpture. It 
stands to reason that Smith's method of composing works in direct metal grew out 
of the collage technique with which he experimented in the early 1930s. A direct- 
metal sculptor usually cuts his larger elements and spreads them out on the floor, 
all the while imagining their evolution. In effect, Smith was working horizontally 
with relief elements closely related to his drawings and paintings. The practice of 
contour-line drawing that had been drilled into him at the Art Students League 
stood him in good stead. All during the 1930s he assimilated and adapted whatever 
caught his eye, producing a sequence of works in which the initial impulse had been 
suggested by the works of other artists. In 1934 in New York, he saw an exhibition 
of sculpture by Gargallo and an exhibition of "Abstract Sculpture" by Giacometti at 
the Julien Levy Gallery. Gargallo's curved planes of sheet metal immediately made 
their appearance in Smith's work, while Giacometti's Surrealist freedom, his use of 
the horizontal plane as both base and sculpture, and the irrationality of his imagery 
began to appear in Smith's drawings. Also in 1934, Graham gave Smith a small work 
by Gonzalez and showed him two others in his possession. In 1935, Smith began his 
great pilgrimage to Europe, stopping in Paris, where Graham educated him in the 
latest developments, visiting the Soviet Union, and then returning to Paris and 
spending several weeks in Hayter's Atelier 17, where he certainly encountered a great 
deal of Surrealist talk. 

Smith returned to New York in July 1936— a New York that had been galva- 
nized by Barr's exhibitions. Smith, an assiduous reader, talker, and searcher, would 
have had the glimmering of possible syntheses of all he had seen in Europe by 
perusing Barr's catalogue for Cubism and Abstract Art. There, Barr had reproduced 
one of the five Giacomettis in the show, Head-landscape (1932), which, he said, was 
"from the Surrealist point of view, a successful plastic pun, but it is also an interest- 
ing biomorphic abstraction and a solution of one of the problems which has recent-

ly held the attention of sculptors, namely the composition of isolated forms which 
Arp had suggested in his reliefs and which Giacometti carries further in his project 
for a City Square." 49 In the same catalogue, Barr reproduced Lipchitz's Elle and 
Harp Player of 1931, both of which utilize coiling wiry elements. Barr described 
them as abstract anthropomorphic figures achieving great formal interest by their 
transparent effect of intertwining lines. 50 Barr also showed Calder's 1936 mobile (a 
work strongly reminiscent of Miro) and said that Calder had recently abandoned 
geometric shapes in favor of irregular, quasi-organic forms. 

Fortified by the arguments proposed in this important exhibition and book, 
Smith, and many other artists in New York, were inspired to seek their own tone of 
voice. The late 1930s and early 1940s, as troubling as they were, saw innumerable 
American artists strike out on their own— some out of despair over their long 
apprenticeship to the Europeans, others out of an exuberant, dawning confidence in 
their own artistic destiny. There was a strong feeling among artists of Smith's genera- 
tion that the only answer to their various artistic dilemmas was a kind of reckless 
decision to experiment, take risks, and, as so many of them said, strike out into the 
unknown. Smith was among them. A new quixotic and whimsical note occurred in 
his iron construction Suspended Figure of 1935 (cat. no. 100), and found its full 
expression two years later in Billiard Player Construction (cat. no. 103), a work for 
which there are enough drawings to suggest Smith's process. Smith's audacity as a 
sculptor is marked in this adaptation of Picasso's painting vocabulary, for certainly 
his point of view was strongly influenced by Picasso's The Studio and, perhaps even 
more, by Painter and Model, both completed in 1928. Billiard Player Construction % 
organic references within a geometric linear framework, and the humor in translat- 
ing the rounded joint of the wire billiard cue, are Picassoesque. But there is some- 
thing of Smith's own here too. He has, with considerable boldness, defied the usual 
sculptural canons by establishing what Edward F. Fry called a "space frame" as a 
means of establishing a pictorial plane for a frontal but nevertheless three-dimen- 
sional composition/ 1 This pictorial element in which Smith also proposed anthro- 
pological references remained an essential part of Smith's vocabulary throughout his 
life. He never flinched from what many artists of his period would have called, 
scornfully, literary references. His Joycean impulse was to invent arresting forms that 
carried their story with them. Smith's sense of freedom toward the end of the 1930s 
was undoubtedly enhanced by the example of Giacometti, whose The Palace at 



5i 



4 A.M. was a celebrated work, as was the horizontal Woman with Her Throat Cut (cat. 
no. 92). In 1937, Smith produced Interior (cat. no. 104), a freely adapted version of 
Giacometti's palace, decidedly frontal; and in 1939, Interior for Exterior (cat. no. 106), 
a complicated fusion of Surrealist fantasy and Constructivist geometric structuring 
in which the automatistic scribblelike use of wrought steel and bronze is juxtaposed 
with a rectilinear "space frame." He hadn't forgotten Picasso's lessons, however, and 
that same year composed Reclining Figure (cat. no. 107), using iron rods and spheri- 
cal joints in a parody of Picasso's first linear pieces. 

By the time the war came, Smith had joined others of his generation in a 
defiant mood, proclaiming the right to use any motif or means. Their iconoclasm 
extended to a kind of syncretism, allowing them to weave back and forth in time 
and space and to draw upon any impressions that they might recollect. Appearing in 
Smith's notebooks and sketches of the war period and for a few years after are 
Surrealist automatistic exercises, and ambiguous forms that such painters as Gorky, 
de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Gottlieb were also using. Smith also responded to 
the dark mounting pressures of the world in 1939 with the anecdotal, quasi- 
Surrealist Medals for Dishonor, demonstrating his defiance toward stylistic rules by 
declaring his inspiration from ancient coins and, at the same time, his moralistic 
political indignation in classical caricature tinged by Surrealist derision. Sometime 
in the early 1950s, Smith wrote in his notebook: 

Do we dare do bad works 

often they are the best 

in such a sense bad is only the external opinion 

but inwardly the artist feels new depths 

and he is already there where 

the others are not 

or may not get for a generation. 52 
He had been gearing up for the "bad works" by his eclectic fusions such as Home of 
the Welder of 1945 (cat. no. 108), in which literary metaphors are rampant and the 
juxtaposition of disparate parts in a framed stage (or box, as in the Joseph Cornell 
works he had also seen) provide a stream-of-consciousness atmosphere quite foreign 
to prevailing sculptural modes. 

By 1950, the "new depths" the artist inwardly felt (so much like Picasso's defi- 
nition of freedom as "the act of freeing something in oneself") were plumbed with

increasing assurance. Smith's works of the 1950s show his complete coming of age, 
and in one work after another he was able to produce a commanding presence 
unlike anything that had preceded. Smith continued his exploration of the "space 
frame" in a group of welded-steel compositions on an increasingly monumental 
scale. At first there were the candid drawings in space, such as The Letter of 1950 (cat. 
no. 113), an abacuslike compendium of framed signs reminiscent of both Torres- 
Garcia and Gottlieb. Then there were the airborne drawings in space, such as the 
Hudson River Landscape of 195 1 (cat. no. 115), of which Smith spoke in several state- 
ments, always stressing the psychological source in the fluid movement of travel 
through a landscape and the free associations that the various elements can inspire. 
That same year, Smith welded the large, triumphant Australia, bringing the lessons 
of Gonzalez into a new monumental realm, and a year later he began the Agricola 
sculptures (sometimes referred to as a series, but in Smith's view, grouped together 
only because they comprised "many found objects, like hand-forged parts of agricul- 
tural implements that have functioned in the past era, "" cat. nos. 116-17). Also in 
1952, Smith worked on diverse standing figures, such as The Hero (cat. no. 118), in 
which he harked back both to Brancusi, whose organic incorporation of pedestal 
and work had impressed Smith, and to Miro, leading him into the powerful works 
grouped under the title Tank Totem, beginning in 1953 and continuing into the 
1960s. The element of the base of an industrial tank became, in these works, the 
magic touchstone, allowing Smith to give free play to his increasing desire to make 
great signs, resembling semaphores, against the sky. 

By this time, Smith was cutting large, curved members and welding them into 
new configurations with great assurance. His mastery of his means enabled him to 
try many different techniques, some fondly recalling Gonzalez, as in the clusters of 
short elements found in Gonzalez's Head Called "The Snail" of 1935 (cat. no. 51) 
and translated by Smith in the Timeless Clock of 1957 (cat. no. 123) into a more 
robust conformation (which is also related to Calder's cosmic imagery analogous to 
the orrery). Gonzalez and Picasso are also recalled in a group of a dozen forged-steel 
works of 1955, in which Smith drew out the lines of his steel bars into tall, sugges- 
tive, slender figures, a motif later elaborated in the composed works of 1956-57 that 
he called Sentinels (cat. no. 120). Many of these vertical works emerged from Smith's 
careful evaluation of Gonzalez, particularly works such as The Dream of 193 1. Like 
Gonzalez, Smith returned again and again to the translation of the erect human fig- 



53 



ure into a resounding composite of allusions. In many works, he continued to use 
color to emphasize implied volumes. But in the 1950s, he rarely used color illusion- 
istically, as he had, for instance, in the works of the 1930s. At times, as in the late 
works grouped under the title Cubi, Smith burnished the surfaces of his steel vol- 
umes in order to suggest the painter's scumble, insisting always that the painter's 
prerogatives could be joined with the sculptor's. In this he was faithful to Picasso, 
who, painter that he was, used paint on his metal constructions to unify them. 

The immense vitality that Smith displayed in this developing history of the 
iron age was extraordinarily evident during his last years, when he produced the 
Voltri series, the apogee of the whole tradition. He had written as early as 1952: 

My aim in material function is the same as in locomotive building: to arrive 
at a given functional form in the most efficient manner. The locomotive 
method bows to no accepted theory of fabrication. It utilizes the respective 
merits of casting, forging, riveting, arc and gas welding, brazing, silver solder- 
ing. It combines bolts, screws, shrink fits— all because of their respective effi- 
ciency in arriving at an object or form in function. 54 
Although Smith's grand vision of locomotive building certainly moved him outside 
the pale of European sculpture, he carried on— much to his credit— the fundamental 
principles laid down by Picasso and Gonzalez, but without being trameled by them. 
He furthered a technique and a vocabulary of forms. He did not change sculptural 
syntax any more than a poet does when he plays on the sonnet form. What Smith 
did was to express passionate intuitions through his choices among forms and the 
ways of construing them, as does a poet with words. In Voltri he not only called 
upon old memories of the work of Picasso and Gonzalez, but he recalled 
Giacometti, too, such as in the marvelous wheeled Voltri VII (cat. no. 124) and the 
sculptor's table reminiscent of Giacometti's 1933 bronze. The delights he had experi- 
enced working uninterrupted in Italy carried into the last year of his life, when he 
produced the large wheeled fantasies he called Wagon, one of which returns in very 
large scale as straightforward forged iron, rounding the circle of the iron age.

The new psychological realm of Giacometti 

In 1928, the year that Picasso began his collaboration with Gonzalez, the twenty- 
seven-year-old Giacometti, still an occasional art student at the Academie de la 
Grande Chaumiere, had the good luck to have two sculptures exhibited at the 
Jeanne Bucher Gallery. There he was spotted by Andre Masson, who immediately 
introduced him to the group of renegade Surrealists at the rue Blomet, among them 
Bataille, Miro, and, most important, the young poet Leiris. Giacometti, who until 
then had been a lonely foreigner, often desperately depressed, was suddenly part of a 
largely French group that not only encouraged his volatile impulses but quickly 
placed him at the center of their own campaign against received ideas in Western 
culture. Breton summarized the situation of sculpture at that moment: 

From its original exteriority, the object in sculpture became increasingly self- 
denying in appearance as it traversed the two great crises of cubism and futur- 
ism. . . . Emerging from these movements, it found itself putting its resources, 
in constructivism, against the mathematical object that had just appeared on the 
scene radiating a faultless, overwhelming elegance. From that moment it had 
no alternative but to arise, phoenix-like, from its own ashes, achieving this 
renascence by calling on the growing power of automation (Arp), the pure 
joys of equilibrium (Calder), the inescapable, dialectical play between the 
solid and the hollow (Moore), or, safeguarded by constant reference to first 
principle— Egyptian art, the evolving art of Persia, Assyria and Babylon, the 
art of the Cyclades group of the Aegean Islands— all the resources of the mod- 
ern poetic magic (Giacometti)." 

The work that had first captured Masson's attention was Gazing Head, one of 
what Giacometti called his "plaque" sculptures, completed during the winter of 
1927-28. This was the first of his works that the young sculptor felt had brought 
him to a new road after much searching. And yet, when he talked about it, 
Giacometti's characteristic doubt, which so endeared him to his increasingly trou- 
bled and doubting friends among the writers, is primary: "Did I actually want to 
make something I saw in things, or express the way I felt about them? Or a certain 
feeling for form that is inside you and you want to bring it outside?" s6 How he felt 
about things, and a certain feeling for form, would be held in a remarkable tension 
in his important works of the next few years. Through his art, Giacometti was a 



55 



most eloquent spokesman for the prevailing sense in the 1930s of the total instabili- 
ty of things. The son of an intelligent and accomplished painter, Giacometti came 
well equipped to his task. Aside from his studies in Paris, first with Archipenko and 
then with Antoine Bourdelle, he had had a thorough training in drawing and paint- 
ing from his father. In his various memoirs of his early years in Stampa, 
Switzerland, he always stressed his training in draftsmanship. It was then, according 
to Giacometti, that at the age of around eighteen, he had his first intimation of a 
conflict that would later be of crucial significance. He described how his father had 
set up a still life of pears, and how he had drawn them increasingly smaller, defying 
centuries of tradition by ignoring foreshortening in favor of the way things at a dis- 
tance are really seen: small and bereft of the third dimension. In Paris, Giacometti 
doggedly pursued through drawing a burgeoning insight about the psychology of 
perception. A fellow student described Giacometti in his cramped hotel room in the 
mid-i920S as a passionate draftsman: "To get to the basics of a face he would indi- 
cate the significant points with dots and connect them with fine lines, like a com- 
plex system of coordinates." 57 This method— much like that Gonzalez had spoken of, 
with "points in space" that had to be linked up— was developed with full knowledge 
of Cubist precedents. When he began to explore the modern idioms of sculpture, 
Giacometti had in mind the works he had recently seen by three sculptors who had 
taken their cues from Picasso: Archipenko, Lipchitz, and above all Laurens, to 
whom he made a special pilgrimage in the mid-i920s. Giacometti also knew 
Picasso's own experiments with phenomenological perception, such as making pin- 
head figures to create the illusion of distance, and playing with perceptual ambigui- 
ties and anamorphic perspectives in works such as Painter and Model of 1928. 

Like other sculptors in the age of iron, Giacometti had also considered the 
work of Brancusi. In his Spoon Woman of 1926 (cat. no. 86), with its gently hol- 
lowed oval torso, there are shades of Brancusi, as well as of Cycladic, New Guinean, 
and African sources. The slender plaster slabs that Giacometti turned into planar 
heads the following year— his "plaque" sculptures— show him moving toward the 
reductions that he would later make the essence of his style. They constituted, as 
Cocteau remarked, "such powerful light sculpture . . . that one is led to speak of 
snow that preserves the footprint of a bird."** The works of 1928-29, although mod- 
eled rather than welded and still carrying the imagery derived from the folk-art 
spoon, metamorphosed into a sign for woman. However, they are already opening

out, incorporating levels of space and pure undulating, linear movement, as in 
Reclining Woman Who Dreams (cat. no. 89). By that time, Giacometti was imbibing 
the fierce lessons of Bataille, whose "metaphysics of cruelty and self-derision," " as 
Yves Bonnefoy has called Bataille's preoccupation with violent imagery, for a time 
deeply affected Giacometti. The stabbing gesture in Man and Woman (cat. no. 88) is 
explicitly sexual and moves into space with the linear force that Picasso had 
unleashed in 1928-30. 

Leiris, who published an article in the newly founded review Documents on 
Giacometti's most recent works in 1929, spoke of the young sculptor passionately. 
He pointed out that "everything he makes is like a fixation of one of those 
moments we experience as crises, which live from the intensity of a quickly per- 
ceived and immediately internalized adventure." 60 Later, Giacometti himself, in a let- 
ter to Pierre Matisse, spoke of his work at that time as giving him some part of his 
vision of reality, but lacking "a sense of the whole, a structure, also a sharpness that 
I saw, a kind of skeleton in space." 6 ' Leiris's allusion to moments of crises refers to 
the personal experience of an exceptionally sensitive artist, but the widespread feel- 
ing of general crisis in Europe at that time certainly contributed to the heightened 
emotional tone of Leiris and of scores of other writers. This was not a vague or sen- 
timental feeling. There were real events from 1930 until the war that amounted to 
more than intellectual crises. To cite just one instance: in November 1930, to accom- 
pany the showing of their film L'Age d'or at Studio 28, Luis Buhuel and Salvador 
Dali arranged for an exhibition of works by Max Ernst, Man Ray, Miro, Arp, and 
other Surrealists. A few days after the riotous first night, members of the League of 
Patriots and the League Against Jews (Ligue antijuive) stormed the theater and 
sacked the gallery, destroying several works. 

This event was one of many that alarmed and disheartened Paris, and 
Giacometti, always attentive to political events and at times a militant activist, was 
not untouched. In 1930, Dali saw Giacometti's sculpture Suspended Ball of 1930 in a 
prestigious exhibition of works by Arp, Miro, and Giacometti at Pierre Loeb's 
gallery, and fetched Breton immediately. Both Surrealists saw the aggressive distinc- 
tion of a work in which metal bars, introduced as sculptural material by Picasso, 
were transformed into a cubic prison for a potentially sinister encounter. The 
Surrealists, after all their proselytizing for the shock value of gratuitous encounters, 
as expressed in the Comte de Lautreamont's series of images beginning with the 



57 



words "beautiful as . . ." (and, in one celebrated passage, continuing: "the chance 
encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table"), felt that 
they had found their man. And Giacometti felt an instant affinity with Breton and 
quickly became a very active member of the Surrealist cenacle. While Breton had 
seen magical poetry in Suspended Ball, and Dali had rightly called attention to what 
he termed the symbolically active objects, Giacometti knew that he was coming clos- 
er to the fusion of how he felt about things and how a feeling for form could be 
harnessed to a kind of psychological anecdote. 

Breton lost no time broadcasting the importance of the new recruit and 
shortly after their first meeting published Giacometti's drawings and text entitled 
"Objets mobiles et muets" in the December 1931 issue of Surrealisme au service de la 
revolution. These explicit drawings of the sculptures in which Giacometti suspended 
suggestive objects (for instance, the bisected ball that resembled buttocks, in 
Suspended Ball) fulfilled the need for movement, what Giacometti called in the letter 
to Pierre Matisse "a third element." He wanted his works to contain a suggestion of 
movement as a sensation that could be induced. Such a suggestion of movement 
occurred in the game-board works of 1931, such as Man, Woman, and Child of 1931, 
with its obvious anecdotal intention, but became more highly developed beginning 
in 1932. Giacometti's own description of his next phase, in which intense feelings 
and often violent imagery took precedence over formal considerations, makes clear 
the nature of his revolt against his entire background and training: 

It was no longer a question of reproducing a lifelike figure but of living. . . . 
There was also a need to find a solution between things that were rounded 
and calm, and sharp and violent. It is this which led during those years ('32- 
'34 approximately) to objects going in directions that were quite different 
from each other, a kind of landscape— a head lying down; a woman strangled, 
her jugular vein cut; construction of a palace with a skeleton bird and a spiral 
column in a cage and a woman at the other end.' 12 

Despite the Surrealist emphasis on oneiric signification, anecdote, and arcane 
imagery, Giacometti during those years addressed himself also to problems endemic 
to the sculptor's vision: how to work both with and against gravity; how to suggest 
different apprehensions of space within a single work; how to make parts become 
subordinate to a whole. In Model for a Square of 1932 (a version of which is seen in 
the 1932 drawing of his atelier, Giacometti was faithful to his new idea of making

things discrete and going in different directions, but the desire for unity is evident 
in his aligning on a diagonal a scooped-out half-sphere rising from the ground, and 
a sphere hollowed in the ground, beckoning to its sister form. In Woman with Her 
Throat Cut of the same year, Giacometti literally finds the skeletal reduction he had 
sought for some time, and suggests with great force the idea that the floor as 
ground and the sight line from above are suitable means for a sculptor to suggest 
the tensions between disparate forms and compositional unity. 

In 1933, he worked out the scenario for his markedly theatrical The Palace at 
4 A.M. in several drawings, which appears to confirm Reinhold Hohl's suggestion 
that one of the primary sources Giacometti drew upon were set designs from prewar 
Russia. Certainly the several levels of space articulated by the cagelike enclosure of 
the dangling spine, the suspended trapeze, and the upper tower suggest the new con- 
ception of theatrical space put forward in Vsevolod Meyerhold's theater, with its 
determination to move vertically as well as horizontally. Kazimir Malevich had set it 
out clearly, and to the degree that Giacometti worked out the basic structure of this 
three-dimensional drama, he was partaking of the Constructivist tradition. However, 
the strongest element was certainly that of the mythmaking demanded by 
Surrealism. 

With Invisible Object of 1934, Giacometti began his exodus from Surrealism, 
although Breton regarded the work as worthy of praise in several of his important 
writings. This large, static, frontal, clearly Egyptian-inspired sculpture had an enor- 
mous impact upon viewers, thanks to its fusion of seemingly ancient modes of see- 
ing with strange spatial restrictions established in the additive way Picasso had 
worked on his assembled pieces. The figure itself carries memories of hieratic ges- 
tures of a venerable tradition. But the framelike chair and the plaque imprisoning 
the woman's shins establish spaces more akin to the modern vision of construed, 
planar space. Although there are shades of the dark imagery favored by the 
Surrealists (the head is uncannily like that of a praying mantis, that carnivorous 
insect that so fascinated the Surrealists because they believed that the female con- 
sumed her mate after the act of coitus), the essential impact lies in its basically 
sculptural, as opposed to anecdotal, conception. 

Giacometti's experiences in the 1930s undoubtedly shaped the artistic devel- 
opment that led to his postwar works, with their unique resolutions of sculptural 
problems. His search for fresh approaches to the articulation of three-dimensional 



59 



space led him beyond the conventions of sculpture established during the first half 
of the century and into the spatial realm of phenomenology. He had moved a long 
way from vanishing-point perspective in his drawings and paintings, in which vec- 
tors and geometric frames within frames always establish the ambiguity of the space 
in which figures loom. And, in his sculpture, he had reduced volumes and stripped 
away surfaces to the point that dynamic space— that essential reference for a sculp- 
tor—becomes the real delineator of a visual experience. He carried the cage enclo- 
sure—a sort of theater of the mind— into a new psychological realm in which, as in 
The Cage (Woman and Head) of 1950 (cat. no. 95), the perceived whole requires an 
instant of adjustment to the existence of several measures of space established by 
vertical forms of different scale, contained and yet not contained by the towerlike 
linear structure. The paradoxes initiated in the 1930s continued to appear, as in the 
sense of motion emphatically braked in his splendid Chariot of 1950 (cat. no. 97), 
with its clearly nonfunctional wheels, and in various versions of Walking Man (cat. 
no. 98), all of which stress the weight and immobility of the huge feet. 

Giacometti's departure from the iron-age vocabulary begins a new chapter in 
sculpture history, in which the articulation of parts is no longer achieved only by 
assembling positive and negative spaces in largely linear terms. Yet, without the 
examples of the 1920s, the final sequence of busts and figures in his oeuvre is 
inconceivable, as he himself often indicated. The harsh decisions he had taken in 
the early 1930s sprang from his personal crisis, but they also reflected the pourquoi pas 
(why not?) of his dejected comrades in Paris and the what-the-hell of their equally 
disheartened American confreres. After the mid-i930s, each had to find his way out 
of the cul-de-sac that Jean-Paul Sartre had begun defining in his widely discussed 
novel La Nausee in the late 1930s. Giacometti, more than most artists, experienced 
the shock of discovering the force of contingency, as did Sartre's anti-hero 
Roquentin, and it would lead him to the works of his maturity, so ridden with 
doubt and epitomizing a tragic vision. The worries of the 1930s, induced by the uni- 
versally acknowledged bad times, followed artists into their studios and hung like 
shrouds on traditional sculptures, forcing many of them to turn away and begin at 
degree zero, as had the early Russian artistic revolutionaries. What happened in 
sculpture as a result of all these turbulent forces was a transformation of the idea of 
space through a combination of doubt and daring, by treating space— that intangi- 
ble but experienced something— as a coequal with matter. Giacometti presided over 



60 



the near dissolution of the sculptural object that had begun with the early twentieth- 
century visions of transparency. He ushered in a period in which ambiguity, or what 
was called "the informal"— a vision of form that Arthur Rimbaud had long before 
prophesied would become the mark of Modern art— became the lingua franca of 
postwar artistic developments, a period that is still evolving today.

Vulcan's Constellation 

The age of iron began many centuries ago by producing very beautiful 
objects, unfortunately for a large part, arms. Today, it provides as well bridges 
and railroads. It is time this metal ceased to be a murderer and the simple 
instrument of a super-mechanical science. Today the door is wide open for 
this material to be, at last, forged and hammered by the peaceful hands of an 
artist. 

Only a cathedral spire can show us a point in the sky where our soul is 
suspended! 

In the disquietude of the night the stars seem to show to us points of 

hope in the sky; this immobile spire also indicates to us an endless number 

of them. It is these points in the infinite which are precursors of the new art: 

"To draw in spacer 1 

So wrote Julio Gonzalez about the new "age of iron" in sculpture that he and Pablo 

Picasso had initiated in the 1930s. This also may be considered as a statement about 

the period kself: the name "age of iron" is particularly appropriate in describing the 

1930s, both for the role that iron played that decade in the work of Picasso and 

Gonzalez— and many artists who followed, such as Alexander Calder, Alberto 

Giacometti, and David Smith— and for the political climate of the time. 2 Coming as 

it did between the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the beginning of World War II, just 

after the Spanish Civil War ended, the 1930s was a decade of iron hardness, and, 

again like iron, was forged under the blows of force and in the heat of fire. The ter- 



65 



minology of the period is replete with terms such as "discipline," "responsibility," 
"commitment," "front," and so on. During the civil war that devastated their coun- 
try, when the Spanish Republicans defended the Basque city of Bilbao against the 
siege by Franco's Nationalist troops, that city was nicknamed, for propaganda pur- 
poses, "the belt of iron." The name is doubly meaningful, referring not only to 
Bilbao's fierce resistance but also to the source of the wealth, and therefore the 
power, of what was then the capital of Basque country: its highly developed iron- 
working industry.' Equally significant is that Bilbao is only a few miles from the 
town of Guernica, which was so cruelly bombed by the German Condor Legion in 
April 1937. The three-day slaughter of unarmed civilians and refugees not only 
helped to solidify resistance psychologically in that defensive "belt of iron," but was 
also the inspiration for the mural that Picasso had been commissioned to create for 
the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's Fair of 1937. 

Between the moment at the beginning of 1937 when Picasso, who by then 
had officially accepted the honorific title of director of the Prado Museum, received 
the commission to create a great work for the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's 
Fair and his decision to draw inspiration from the Guernica massacre, other tragic 
events had taken place in the Civil War. Even Picasso's hometown, Malaga, located 
at the opposite end of Spain from the Basque country, had fallen. Its resistance and 
final surrender, and the ensuing repression carried out by Franco's victorious forces, 
were recorded by Arthur Koestler, a war correspondent at the time who was almost 
executed by the Fascists. 4 But it was Guernica— the deliberate bombing of a defense- 
less civilian population trapped in a small city that had no strategic or military 
value but symbolized the historical identity of the Basque people— that aroused 
Picasso's "fury" 5 and his inspiration. The result was a quickly completed work that 
stood as a universal condemnation of war, one that transcended the tragic event that 
inspired it. Clearly, Picasso had adopted the revolutionary point of view with which 
Goya, in The Third of May, 1808 or The Moncloa Executions, had inverted the conven- 
tional moral of history painting, which traditionally celebrated the victory of the 
conquered ove#.their conquerors. The Moncloa Executions evoked the cruel repression 
carried out by French occupation troops in 1808 after the spontaneous uprising of 
Madrid's populace on the preceding day/' 

Gonzalez also produced emblematic works that sought to reflect the tragedy 
of the Spanish Civil War, especially his celebrated Montserrat. This sculpture simulta-

neously embodied the ideals of freedom and social revolution, defended by the 
now-threatened Republic, and local Catalan identity. (Gonzalez was born in 
Barcelona.) Having been invited to show a work at the Spanish Pavilion, Gonzalez 
had difficulty in deciding between bringing Montserrat— and there is some disagree- 
ment as to whether it was finished a year before Gonzalez received the commission 
from the Republic— or Woman with a Mirror (ca. 1936-37, cat. no. 57). Woman with a 
Mirror is one of the greatest sculptures he would produce, but its composition, 
which was daringly avant-garde, kept it from fulfilling the propagandistic require- 
ments called for at the time. Apparently, Picasso tried to persuade Gonzalez to show 
Woman with a Mirror, but he ultimately chose Montserrat' Picasso, to complement 
Gonzalez's work, brought sculptures that he had made during the first half of the 
decade: the impressive Woman with Vase (1933), two female heads, one female bust, 
and a nude swimmer, all dated 1931 and all bearing the characteristics of pieces 
done in the studio of his country home, the chateau de Boisgeloup, near Paris, 
which he bought in 1930.* 

Joan Miro presented Head of a Catalan Peasant, also known as The Reaper, a 
figure inspired by the folk image of the Catalan peasant, which, in turn, evoked tra- 
ditional nationalist mythology; the painting, however, exhibited the intense, expres- 
sionistic and violent style that Miro had been using since approximately 1934. 
Calder, strongly linked to Miro and Spain, and the only foreign-born artist invited 
to show a work at the Spanish Pavilion, contributed his Mercury Fountain. Finally, 
within what we can call genuinely avant-garde art, the promising Castilian sculptor 
Alberto Sanchez exhibited The Spanish People Have a Road that Leads to a Star.' 

The rest of the Spanish artistic presence in the Pavilion was radically different: 
ninety-four figurative artists, most of whom exhibited illustrations of conventional 
propagandistic scenes. Of the more traditional artists in the Pavilion, one of the 
best-represented in terms of the number and importance of works was Jose Gutierrez 
Solana (18S6-1945), who exhibited fifteen paintings. Solana managed to invert the 
folkloric image of so-called "black Spain," practiced at the end of the previous cen- 
tury by Ignacio Zuloaga, and dug deep into that blackness, beyond the traditions of 
conventional representation icostumhrismo). As a result, unexpectedly, a painter who 
until then had been viewed with misgiving in and outside of Spain, began to attract 
international interest. 10 There were other, lesser-known Spanish painters and sculp- 
tors of the same period who, agreeing with or adopting international tendencies 



67 



then in force, revolved around a more or less expressionist realism." Clearly, among 
the many figurative artists not all were mediocre illustrators of military feats. 
Almost all of those who had artistic talent chose realism precisely because the avant- 
garde model had entered a period of crisis during the 1930s. 11 

The prevailing artistic style among the works shown in that Pavilion, created 
against the tragic and hallucinatory background of the Civil War, was not different 
from the dominant international currents, which caused the decade to be nick- 
named the "era of the realisms." " With the exception of the Abstraction-Creation 
group and the isolated activity of some members of the avant-garde, many of whom 
had by then become teachers, most artists in the 1930s had returned to figuration 
and realism. This included the dominant faction among the Surrealists, who at the 
time were strongly influenced by the ideas and works of Salvador Dali and Rene 
Magritte, enemies of automatic painting and any form of abstraction. Mexican 
muralism, which reached the height of its prestige during the 1930s, was also a clear 
manifestation of what was then understood as a social art of political propaganda. 

During that decade, these polarized attitudes brought into opposition abstrac- 
tionists and realists, a confrontation that not infrequently became a revision of the 
old conflict between avant-garde and tradition, a struggle between a formalist art 
and one of content, of elite versus popular. Picasso was one of only five avant-garde 
artists invited to participate in the Spanish Pavilion, the others being Calder, 
Gonzalez, Miro, and Sanchez. What these artists were to make concrete, through 
their individual works, was this "crisis of the avant-garde." They sought to transcend 
the conventional dichotomy between avant-garde and realism by means of what we 
could call an attempt to "semantify" the avant-garde idiom. 14 

I think that Picasso's evolution during these years— approximately between 
1925 and 1940— was in this regard a paradigm. It became a driving force that stimu- 
lated what other artists of similar tendencies, such as Gonzalez, were beginning to 
produce. The issue of who deserves preeminence with regard to the new style of 
making sculpture in iron is banal and inappropriate. Nor does it seem relevant to 
repeat the commonplace about Picasso the "artist" seeking help from Gonzalez the 
"artisan," and how, because of their brief collaboration, the artist learned how to use 
the acetylene torch and the artisan found his way toward creative art. In the same 
context— although more interesting— the difference that critics have seen between 
how Gonzalez and Picasso conceived iron sculpture does not seem fundamental to

me. Picasso saw it in synthetic and objectified form, the culmination of his Cubist 
experience with collage, while Gonzalez viewed it in basically naturalist style, as art 
historian Rosalind Krauss has so cogently described it." What I think most impor- 
tant is their fundamental agreement about the need to respond to the crisis of the 
avant-garde without having to reject its idiom or doing it violence. 

In a certain sense, this attitude goes back to what Breton, when he was still a 
Dadaist, postulated in the years immediately following World War I, when he indig- 
nantly rebelled not only against the "return to order," but also against the academic 
stabilization of Cubism. I am not referring only to Breton's simple declaration that 
"Cubism was a school of painting, Futurism a political movement," and Dada "a 
state of being." ' He also spoke about the need to "perhaps restore content to 
form."'" As is well known, Breton was better at defining problems than solving 
them: his suggestion about how to articulate this restitution of content to form went 
no further initially than holding up the metaphysical Giorgio de Chirico as a 
model; even though he resisted condemning the relevance of "plastic automatism" 
to the plastic arts from the revolutionary perspective of first-stage Surrealism, he 
also resisted elaborating upon the practice, a notion even more improbable than 
automatic writing. 18 In any case, no one can deny he had a premonition regarding 
the crisis of the avant-garde and its eventual "semantification," or that he strongly 
believed that the person best suited to provide the solution was Picasso, that quin- 
tessential Modernist who had repeatedly refused to leap entirely into abstraction. 19 

Picasso's situation in the period between the two wars was rather complicated 
and at times dramatic. After World War I, not only was Picasso's financial situation 
secure but he became a "star," much sought-after by high society. His marriage to 
the Russian ballerina Olga Koklova distanced him from the bohemian circles of his 
earlier period and gave him an air of respectable bourgeois stability that dangerously 
rounded out his social success. However, the most serious problem for art at that 
time was the apparent "return to order" of many avant-garde artists and the devel- 
opment of a Cubist "school," which reached its apotheosis in 1925 with the 
Exposition internationale des arts decoratifs in Paris. The Surrealists, then in their first, 
organizational phase, justly and violently attacked the exhibition. Picasso was not 
immune to these "reactionary" temptations, which in his work took the form of 
Mediterranean neoclassicism and of using Ingres as a model, thus accentuating the 
"pleasing" side of his work. But Picasso is Picasso, and even when such elements of 



69 



regressive weakness appeared in his art between 19 15 and 1925 he could produce 
works of astonishing intensity and strangeness: for example, The Three Bathers, which 
he painted in the summer of 1920 in Juan-les-Pins, whose background figure is 
deformed in a style of prolongation that prefigured what was to come; or that other 
pair of mysterious, sarcastic, rather infernal trios, The Three Musicians (1921) and the 
very disturbing Three Ballerinas (1925). We also have to take cognizance of the sets he 
created for Sergei Diaghilev's ballets, particularly for Parade and Mercure, whose revo- 
lutionary force, from the plastic point of view, was appreciated almost exclusively by 
the Dadaists and Surrealists, even though they found ballet itself revolting. 20 

Some of the statements Picasso made during the 1920s allow us to see clearly 
how he was already distancing himself from those who, artistically speaking, were 
allowing themselves to be carried along by events, rejecting the ever more academic 
avant-garde, especially Cubism. So, with deliberate ambiguity, he asserted that "the 
artist should know the means by which to convince others of the truth of his lies. If 
in his work he only shows he has investigated and explored the means by which his 
lies will be believed, he will never achieve anything." And also: "Cubism is no differ- 
ent from the other pictorial schools. The same principles and elements are common 
to all of them." 2 ' 

Toward the end of 1924, the first issue of La Revolution surrealiste appeared. 
As an organ of the iconoclastic Surrealist movement, it sought to settle accounts 
with Modernism along the lines announced by Breton in his Dadaist writings. The 
first issue included reproductions of works by Giorgio de Chirico, Raymond 
Desnos, Max Ernst, Man Ray, Andre Masson, Max Morise, Pierre Naville, and— sur- 
prisingly— Picasso. In the following years, the Surrealists repeatedly treated Picasso 
differently from other avant-garde artists, despite the fact that he always shunned 
any formal relationship with Breton's group. 

As early as the second issue of La Revolution surrealiste, published on January 
15, 1925— during Surrealism's initial, most arbitrary and combative phase— the respect 
that Picasso inspired was obvious. The cover of that issue featured a photograph of a 
scarecrow with the title "French Art at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century." The 
issue's numerous illustrations included a two-page spread devoted entirely to Picasso: 
eight of the drawings completed during 1924 that would later be engraved for 
Ambroise Vollard's edition of Honore de Balzac's short story "The Unknown 
Masterpiece."

Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," published in 
1931. 



In 1926, Picasso, commenting ironically on the abuse of certain interpreta- 
tions made by the Surrealists about his drawings, told Jaime Sabartes: 

Some followers of the Surrealist school discovered that my ink sketches and 
drawings are composed of dots and lines. It's that I admire celestial maps. I 
think they're beautiful, even if I don't know what they mean. So, one day, I 
started to trace out a huge number of dots connected by lines and blots that 
looked suspended in the sky I had the idea of using them in my composi- 
tions, introducing them as purely graphic elements. But just see how astute 
these Surrealists are. They discovered that these drawings corresponded to 
their own abstract ideas. 22 
Irrespective of the natural repugnance all artists feel for literary or incomplete inter- 
pretations made at the expense of their work, and irrespective of the reluctance 
Picasso always felt about allowing himself to be summed up in Surrealist rhetoric, 
this statement is especially valuable vis-a-vis the text by Julio Gonzalez quoted at the 
beginning of this essay. It is not a matter of verifying the source of Gonzalez's ideas 
about "drawing in space" starting from the contemplation of the stars. If one exam- 
ines the larger art-historical context of the period, it becomes clear just how impor- 
tant the theme of the celestial constellations was at that moment in the history of 
the avant-garde and, more generally, in Modern art. 

This idea is supported by Albert Boime's recent effort to discover the sources 
and the meaning of Vincent van Gogh's famous painting The Starry Night (1889). 
Boime not only explains convincingly the realistic elements in a picture that until 
now has been romantically interpreted as the fantastic product of a hallucinatory 
mind, but also shows the impact that increased astronomical knowledge had on 
contemporary art. Through his revisionist interpretation of this work, we can see the 
fascination of many artists with the new physical image of the stars and, obviously, 
their high metaphorical value. 2 ' 

The influence of van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Paul Cezanne on avant-garde 
groups of the early twentieth century is well known. However, van Gogh's particular 
effect on fin-de-siecle Barcelona— in whose shadow Gonzalez and Picasso devel- 
oped—has been less examined. That is not to say that their interest in celestial maps 
as a source of artistic inspiration derives from van Gogh. 24 But there can be no 
doubt that Picasso and Gonzalez (and many other Modern artists) were influenced 
by the prevailing cultural climate. And, as Boime has pointed out, Camille 



71 



Flammarion's scientific essays about astronomy and its mystical-philosophical 
implications were extraordinarily popular in France and were almost simultaneously 
translated into several other languages, including Spanish (published in Barcelona 
by the important Catalan company Montaner y Simon). 25 

In part augmented by his reputation as a martyr of art, van Gogh had a huge 
influence in fin-de-siecle bohemian circles and the avant-garde of the new century, 
and posthumously cast his somber aura on the personal world of Picasso. Picasso 
had been traumatized by the suicide of his Catalan friend and colleague Carlos 
Casagemas in 1901, an incident that colored both the form and content of his work 
during his first years in Paris. His pessimistic mood was sustained by the prevailing 
aesthetic climate, in which art was frequently linked with love and death and domi- 
nated by the ideas of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche (especially the latter). Those ideas 
had shaped the culture and, in part, the revolutionary politics (primarily that of the 
anarchists) of the Barcelona of Picasso's youth. It left such a deep impression on 
him that it permanently influenced his personality. 26 As Nietzsche declared in Thus 
Spoke Zarathustra: "To engender a dancing star, one must have within oneself ... a 
certain chaos." 27 The Romantic exaltation of the night and the contemplation of the 
stars is a recurring theme in Zarathustra and in the art of certain of its readers, 
among them undoubtedly van Gogh and also the young Picasso and his friends. 

Crossing the starry night of Picasso's production, and directly related to the 
theme of the constellation drawings, is the theme of the alienated artist, the artist 
dominated by chaos and madness, emblematically represented by van Gogh. This 
theme obsessed Picasso, and he crystallized it in the series of drawings he made to 
illustrate "The Unknown Masterpiece," in which the brilliant painter Frenhofer goes 
mad thinking he can see the invisible: the most perfect representation of a female 
figure, transformed in one of his paintings into an inextricable tangle of lines, a 
kind of prototypical abstract painting. 28 

When Picasso, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Guillaume 
Apollinaire's death, was commissioned to create a monument to his friend's memo- 
ry, he wanted to evoke in his sculpture the fictional monument described in 
Apollinaire's prose novelette The Poet Assassinated. In this fantasy, a sculptor, named 
Toiseau du Benin (the Benin bird), erects a monument to the memory of the story's 
hero, the poet Croniamantal. The passage in which the Benin bird speaks to the 
dead poet's mistress, Tristouse, about the kind of statue he's going to create is cited

by Werner Spies— correctly, I believe-as the determining factor in Picasso's idea for 
the monument: 

"A statue, made of what?" asked Tristouse. "Marble? Bronze?" 

"No, that's too old-fashioned," answered the Benin bird. "I want to 
erect to him a statue made of nothing, like poetry and fame." 

"Bravo! Bravo!" replied Tristouse, applauding, "a statue made of noth- 
ing, of the void, that's the very thing. When do we start?" 29 
But the idea of this nothing, the void, was for Picasso like falling into the total 
absence of content, the loss of the figure, pure irrationality, the abstract. If such 
chaos is creatively essential for Picasso, the work of art arises out of its conjuring. 

In 1923, the year that he began to make his first "drawings in space"— both 
those for "The Unknown Masterpiece" and the sketches he did for the ballet 
Mercure— he made the following statement to Mario de Zayas: "Frequently, a concern 
with [formalist] investigation has caused painting to lose its way and caused the 
artist to get lost in intellectual analysis. Perhaps that's the principal defect of 
Modern art. The spirit of [formalist] investigation has poisoned those who did not 
completely understand all the positive and decisive elements of Modern art, which 
made them try to paint the invisible and, therefore, to try to paint what cannot be 
painted." '° 

The publication in 1923 of this and other statements by Picasso invites the 
legitimate speculation that he was trying to distance himself from those who had 
tried to establish a scientific basis for Cubism, which by then had become some- 
thing of a formal "school" based on a rigorous intellectual system of composition. 
Among those who championed this form of Cubism was the Spaniard Juan Gris, 
with whom Picasso had an ambivalent relationship (although perhaps Picasso's dis- 
affection with Gris was exaggerated by Gertrude Stein"). In fact, nearly all Spanish 
avant-garde artists felt an antipathy toward Gris, objecting to his overly "abstract" 
approach to painting, his immersion in intellectual analysis and formalist investiga- 
tion. It was enough to drive anyone mad, and its fatal result was the insane desire to 
try to "paint the invisible," as in Balzac's prophetic short story. 

Vollard published "The Unknown Masterpiece," with thirteen etchings by 
Picasso, in 1931. The volume also included, as a kind of introduction, reproductions 
of some sixteen pages from a sketchbook Picasso had used in 1926 in Juan-les-Pins 
and sixty drawings scattered throughout the text of the novel. In his celebrated 



73 



Recollections of a Picture Dealer, Vollard recalled the publication as follows: "But of 
all the works I have published, the one that most puzzled the bibliophiles when it 
was announced was Balzac's Chef d'CEuvre Inconnu, with original etchings and wood- 
cuts by Picasso, in which cubist realisations rub shoulders with drawings that 
remind one of Ingres. But each new work of Picasso's shocks the public, till the day 
when astonishment gives way to admiration." 32 

This strange combination of what Vollard calls "Cubist works" and "drawings 
that recall Ingres" also applies to the engravings Picasso did for his Suite Vollard 
(1930-37) and an edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses ( 1931). The theme of the relation- 
ship between the painter and his model in the seclusion of the studio was developed 
in both. This theme in turn conjures up others: the confrontation between the reali- 
ty of the model and the reality of the work; the erotic relationship between the artist 
and his real or imagined model; the self-absorption of the artist; and melancholy." 

Contradiction was an inherent part of Picasso's characteristic creative dynam- 
ic. He never simply moved from one approach or style to another but juggled sever- 
al simultaneously over an extended period, and only gradually did one emerge as 
predominant. Such was the process that took Picasso from the "drawings in space"— 
which influenced his paintings during the late 1920s as much as those sculptural 
essays in iron that required the participation of Gonzalez as artisan— to the more 
classic organic forms with rounded shapes that became more and more frequent in 
the paintings and sculptures he made in the early 1930s in his studio at Boisgeloup. 
The photographer Brassai' visited Boisgeloup in 1933, and commented on the classi- 
cal and undulating character of the majority of the works he found there: 

He opened the door to one of those immense naves, and we could see, radi- 
ant in white, a city of sculptures. ... I was astonished by the roundness of all 
those forms. A new woman had entered Picasso's life: Marie-Therese Walter. 
He'd found her quite by accident on rue de la Boetie and painted her for the 
first time exactly one year before, on December 16, 1931, in the Red Chair. . . . 
After that day, all his painting began to undulate. Since the planar and the 
corporeal, straight lines, angular lines, frequently clash in his work with 
curved lines, sweetness following on harshness, tenderness following on vio- 
lence. In no moment of his life was his painting so undulating, so full of sin- 
uous curves, arm twisted with arm, hair in spirals. . . . Most of the statues 
that stood before me revealed the stamp of that new look, beginning with the

grand bust of Marie-Therese bent forward, with its almost classical head, the 
straight line of the forehead joined without interruption with the nose, a line 
that invaded his entire work. In the series The Sculptor's Studio, which Picasso 
had engraved for Vollard . . . there were also, in the future plans, monumen- 
tal, almost spherical heads. They weren't imaginary! My surprise was immense 
when I found them here in flesh and blood— I mean in all their relief, all 
curved, the noses more and more prominent, the eyes in the form of balls, 
similar to a savage goddess. 14 
The simultaneity of angles and curves in those sculptures, which so impressed 
Brassai, creates an unexpected sense of drama and violence, even in the most appar- 
ently sweet moments. 

The abstract, the invisible, the merely speculative were, for Picasso, like dia- 
bolical temptations he had to exorcise like so many ghosts. One might imagine that 
such conflicts and choices were also faced by Gonzalez, but in his work there is 
more doubt than dialectic and, in crucial moments, ethics split with aesthetics, 
something that never happened to Picasso. Nevertheless, both of them came to have 
serious doubts about the formalism that increasingly dominated the avant-garde 
during the 1930s. In reaction against this perceived weakness, both of them devel- 
oped what we might call an eccentric attitude in their work— so characteristic of tra- 
ditional Spanish art. That eccentricity of Spanish art revealed itself centuries earlier 
in reaction against the predominant classicism and then returned again in the work 
of Goya. It became rampant in the twentieth century when the very idea of the 
modern became in Spain a tragic matter of identity. In the paradoxical work of 
Goya, it was that tragic aspect which astonished the nineteenth-century French 
writer Theophile Gautier, who related it to the Enlightenment background or Goya's 
images: "Thinking to serve new ideas and beliefs, he traced out the portrait and the 
history of old Spain."" 

Spanish artistic identity had always been full of paradoxes and contradictions. 
Before Romanticism, hardly anything was known about Spanish artists in Europe, 
and the fundamental reason for this ignorance and disdain by Europeans for tradi- 
tional Spanish art was the same reason that has brought about its vindication in our 
time: its anti-classicism.' 6 That predominant anti-classical orientation transformed 
the Spanish School into something at first eccentric and then, more recently, some- 
thing "timeless." 



75 



The timelessness of modern Spanish art manifested itself in just the way 
Gautier perceived it in Goya, but that timelessness has also been a characteristic of 
almost all the best Spanish artists of the twentieth century, including Picasso and 
Gonzalez. Those two made Spanish themes the basis of many of their works, not 
only in the most direct, simple, and, therefore, recognizable manner, through the 
use of orthodox icons, but also through what in another context I have called "a 
moralizing aesthetic fixed in content." " 

Abstraction has been repudiated at one time or another by most Spanish 
avant-garde artists, beginning with Picasso himself. Even Gris, who was disdained by 
almost all his Spanish contemporaries for being too "abstract," "intellectualized," 
"cold," and— the ultimate criticism— "not very Spanish," declared that he was trying 
to "humanize" Cezanne— that is, to reverse the process of abstraction to which the 
technique of the French master led. 3 " However, it is probable that this stance of 
being "outside of history" was also the reason for the surprising facility with which 
the Spanish artists of the twentieth century could assume an avant-garde attitude, 
which implied a break with the past. 39 

One model of anti-classicism as a break with the past was the Gothic revival, 
which began in the second half of the eighteenth century and reached its fullest 
expression in the middle of the nineteenth, opening the way to Modernism. During 
the first third of the twentieth century, when Gonzalez and Picasso were creating 
their mature works, there was a new return to the Gothic, this one more psychologi- 
cal than stylistic. Gonzalez's reference to a cathedral spire pointing to the stars as a 
map pointing the way to the new art of "drawing in space" is an important example 
of the Gothic influence. 

In 19 1 1, three years after he published his Abstraction and Empathy, which 
established his principles of psychological aesthetics, Wilhelm Worringer published 
another book, Form in Gothic. There he describes the prototype of the Gothic per- 
sonality and what he calls "the principle of Gothic architecture": "All expression to 
which Greek architecture attained was attained through the stone, by means of the 
stone; all expression to which Gothic architecture attained, was attained . . . in spite 
of the. stone. Its expression was not derived from the material but from the negation 
of it, by means only of its dematerialization." Worringer elaborates his contrast 
between the classical and the Gothic with the sensuality of classical architecture 
opposed to the pure expressive will of the Gothic, the utility of the classical

opposed to the absence of practical objectives in the Gothic, how the Gothic allows 
itself to be carried away: "There are no walls, no mass . . . only a thousand separate 
energies speak to us, whose substantiality we are hardly conscious of, for they act 
only as vehicles of an immaterial expression ... we see only free and uncontrolled 
energies striving heavenward with an enormous elan" Finally, Worringer juxtaposes 
the beauty of the finite of classical man with the tension suffered by "Gothic man, 
dualistically riven and therefore transcendentally disposed, [who] could only feel the 
thrill of eternity in the infinite." 40 

Some of Worringer's concepts appear to coincide with Gonzalez's ideas and 
works (although there is no indication of any direct influence). Worringer even 
establishes a relationship between the Gothic and the use of iron in Modern art, the 
only essential difference between them being that uniformity in Gothic architecture 
was established by the mode of construction, and in modern iron architecture by 
the material. This difference was eliminated in Gonzalez's iron sculpture, to which it 
is possible to apply what Worringer wrote: 

The modern art of steel construction has first given to us again a certain 
inward understanding of Gothic. Here again people have been confronted 
with an architectural form in which the artistic expression is taken over by 
the medium of construction. 
He adds a short time later, however: 

For in modern architecture it is the material itself which directly invites this 
exclusively structural significance, while in Gothic the structural ideas were 
attained, not by means of the material, but in spite of the material, in spite of 
the stone. In other words: underlying the artistic appearance of the modern 
building constructed of steel there is no will to form which, for particular 
reasons, emphasizes structure, but only a new material. The utmost that 
might be said for it is that it is an atavistic echo of the old Gothic will to 
form which urges the modern Northern man to an artistic emphasis of this 
material and which even allows us to hope for a new style in architecture 
dependent on its relevant use. 41 
Thus, Worringer in 19 11 nurtured the hope that in an undetermined but not too 
distant future an appropriate use of iron would define a new style of construction. 

Picasso and Gonzalez, who took the greatest advantage of iron in the sense of 
that constructive will desired by Worringer, spent their formative years in fin-de-sie- 



77 



cle Barcelona. There, the gothicizing style locally known as modernismo— the term 
usually used in Spain to designate Art Nouveau— was being produced in an over- 
wrought cultural climate that favored what were then referred to as "Nordic val- 
ues." 42 That Picasso was attacked early on in Paris with the contemptuous epithet 
boche (German), the worst insult in France after the Franco-Prussian War, is telling, 
as is the fact that Gonzalez and the equally avant-garde Catalan Miro, among oth- 
ers, used the title "Gothic men" for some of their works. But much of Gonzalez's 
sculpture arises out of his relationship to iron working and the special flowering of 
that old local tradition during Catalonia's fin-de-siecle modernismo. 

We are confronted once again by the anticlassical heritage of the Spanish 
School, which can be viewed as the result of a gothicizing sensibility, renewed dur- 
ing the Baroque period and then revealed again and again, even during the develop- 
ment of the contemporary period. How can we explain Picasso and Gonzalez reviv- 
ing a discredited and extremely humble material like iron and wanting to work it 
with artisan techniques? Was it that eccentric Spanish "Gothic" which so anachro- 
nistically shaped the aesthetic leap taken by them together to use iron as the materi- 
al for constructing a new sculptural space? Not to mention that Gonzalez did not 
find his creative spark until he was over fifty, precisely when he was offered the pos- 
sibility of taking his old trade of smithery to new heights. 

By the same token, pursuing the anthropological factors that might have con- 
tributed to this unexpected expressive movement toward iron by some Spanish 
avant-garde artists, we cannot overlook what Mircea Eliade has written about the 
extremely rich mythological background of iron cultures 4 ' or the wide and complex 
iconographic use in Baroque Spain of the Greco-Roman god Vulcan, the black- 
smith. The Spanish painters of the seventeenth century loved to paint Vulcan, not 
only in the way he was usually represented in European culture but in a rather 
strange style, as a "worker." 44 

Nearly all other Spanish avant-garde artists during the 1930s, those years par- 
ticularly laden with anxiety and tragedy, repeatedly turned to painting still lifes and 
mystical landscapes. Some of the best twentieth-century Spanish still lifes were 
painted between 1936 and 1946. Such is the case not only with Picasso, but also with 
Dali, Oscar Dominguez, Luis Fernandez, and others. However, the most interesting 
and significant example is that of Miro, whose Still Life with Old Shoe (1937) is a 
work that, according to James Thrall Soby, may be compared with Picasso's Guernica.

After giving a precise description of Miro's tragic still life, Soby concludes that "as 
in all the paintings in this series . . . this calamitous situation occurs on the 
ground." However, while continuing in that tragic mode, Miro raised his point of 
view toward the stars, renewing or insisting on that flight of mystical celestial con- 
templation. 4 " Between 1939 and 1944, Miro completed one of his most celebrated 
series, The Constellations. According to his own account, he began the series in 
Normandy, in Varengeville-sur-Mer, the idea having come to him accidentally when 
he noted the effect produced by some paint that had dried on some pages of an 
album. Miro says, referring to some canvases he'd just painted in oil: 

Having finished my work, I washed out my brushes in solvent and, to dry 
them, I wiped them against the white pages of the album, without guiding 
myself with any preconceived notion. The stained surface put me in a good 
mood and provoked the birth of forms, human figures, animals, stars, the 
sky, the moon, and the sun. I drew all of it with charcoal, very vigorously. 
Once I'd achieved plastic balance and put all those elements in order, I began 
to paint with gouache, with the minute care of the artisan or the primitive; 
this kind of work requires quite a bit of time. . . . We had to get out of 
Varangeville right away because the region, which had been calm, was being 
mercilessly bombarded by the Germans. With allied armies completely routed 
and in the thick of continuous bombardments, we took a train for Paris. Pilar 
led Dolors, who was then very small, by the hand, and I held the portfolio 
with The Constellations that were finished and the rest of the album that I 
would use to complete the series under my arm. We left Paris for Barcelona 
one week before the Germans entered Normandy. No sooner had we arrived 
than we left there too as a precaution. We went to Palma, where I could live 
in peace, not known by anyone and without seeing anyone. ... I was very 
depressed at the time. I thought a Nazi victory was inevitable, and that every- 
thing we loved, everything that gave us a reason to go on living had sunk for- 
ever in an abyss. I thought that in this defeat there was no more hope for us, 
and started expressing that feeling of anguish by tracing on the sandy beach 
the signs and forms from which I had to free myself so that the waves would 
immediately take them away. Or I would model figures or arabesques project- 
ed in the air like the smoke from a cigarette that rises to caress the stars, flee- 
ing the stench and decay of a world built by Hitler and his cronies/ 6

Miro's Constellations thus took form as another surprising spatial fugue, whose plas- 
tic image seems to have been produced in the most unpremeditated manner but 
which progressively becomes charged with depth, with dramatic anxiety. 

The theme of the constellations suddenly seems to have proliferated during 
this period. Besides affecting Picasso, Gonzalez, and Miro, it appears in the work of 
Sanchez, who showed his sculpture The Spanish People Have a Road that Leads to a 
Star in the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World's Fair. It is a decidedly avant-garde 
work, strongly influenced by Picasso's sketches for sculptures with biomorphic 
deformations from around the spring and summer of 1928. In any case, it was clear- 
ly a sculpture of ascent. 4- (Later, the theme would appear in the Spanish 
Surrealist Luis Buhuel's film The Milky Way.) 

Are all these things coincidences more or less pushed along by the anthropo- 
logical background of a gothicizing, exaltedly spiritual country on the margin of 
the process of modernizing secularization? Coincidental or not, the resultant works 
of art cannot be interpreted only in terms of a national modality. If Gonzalez can 
be regarded as one of the fundamental points of reference, I would agree with those 
who have observed that the style of his late works is related not only to Picasso but 
also to Torres-Garcia or Magnelli. There is even a certain relationship, as William 
Tucker has pointed out, 4 * with Paul Klee, an artist who, curiously enough, was 
always highly respected by the historical Spanish avant-garde, beginning with Picasso 
and continuing with Miro. 

The theme of the constellations was of prime importance to Klee, as early as 
his visit to Tunisia in 19 14, and it grew in importance during the final period of his 
career, which coincides with the moment we are dealing with here. 49 Later, this same 
theme also dominated a period in the career of Calder, who even adopted the name 
Constellations for an important series of sculptures in the early 1940s. The relation- 
ship between Calder and Miro is clear, as is the sympathy Calder expressed for 
Spain; the feeling was mutual, as demonstrated by the exceptional inclusion of the 
American artist's work in the Spanish Pavilion in 1937. 

Klee, in a revealing passage written in 1902, made the following observation: 

I am not Pan in the reeds, I am merely a human being and want to climb a 

few steps, but really climb them. 

Affect the world, but not as part of a multiplicity like bacteria, but as 

an entity, down here, with connections to what is up there.'

After the outbreak of World War I, Klee developed certain ideas based on the con- 
cepts of Worringer, who had considerable influence on the painters of the German 
Blaue Reiter group, with whom Klee exhibited in 19 12 and 1913." In 19 15, for exam- 
ple, Klee wrote in his diary: 

The heart that beat for this world seems mortally wounded in me. As if only 
memories still tied me to "these" things. . . . Am I turning into the crystalline 
type? 

Mozart took refuge (without neglecting his inferno!) on the joyous 
side, for the most part. Whoever does not understand this might confuse him 
with the crystalline type. [ . . . ] 

One deserts the realm of the here and now to transfer one's activity 
into a realm of the yonder where affirmation is possible. 

Abstraction. 

The cool Romanticism of this style without pathos is unheard of. 

The more horrible this world (as today, for instance), the more abstract 
our art, whereas a happy world brings forth an art of the here and now. 

Today is a transition from yesterday. In the great pit of forms lie bro- 
ken fragments to some of which we still cling. They provide abstraction with 
its material. A junkyard of unauthentic elements for the creation of impure 
crystals. 

That is how it is today. 

But then: the whole crystal cluster once bled. I thought I was dying, 
war and death. But how can I die, I who am crystal? 

I, crystal. [ . . . ] 

I have long had this war inside me. This is why, interiorly, it means 
nothing to me. 

And to work my way out of my ruins, I had to fly. And I flew. I 
remain in this ruined world only in memory, as one occasionally does in ret- 
rospect. 

Thus, I am "abstract with memories." [ . . . ] 

Certain crystalline formations, against which a pathetic lava is ulti- 
mately powerless. 51 
I have quoted this passage at length not only because, as Geelhaar observes, ; it 
underlines the use of those terms so typical of Worringer, such as "crystalline," 



81 



"abstraction," and "immanence" (i.e., "the here and now"), but also because it shows 
Klee in the process of overcoming the avant-garde orthodoxy of abstract formalism 
and moving toward what in the 1930s became his characteristic improvisatory poetic 
style, combining nature and abstraction, life and the laws of pictorial structure. 

Klee, in Utopian fashion, declares himself to be a "bleeding crystal," 54 echoing 
the German philosopher Ernst Bloch, who was also devoted to the Expressionists 
and influenced by Worringer. For Bloch, all historical construction may be reduced 
to the paradigms of the geometrical-Egyptian and the vitalist-Gothic, which are the 
true desirable alternatives. But, ideally, the crystal of death and the tree of life would 
be reunited in a single vision: 

All great constructions have been sui generis, built in Utopia, as the forerunner 
to a space adequate to mankind. And the human thing erected like that, 
transposed into rigorously significant spatial forms, is also, as committed, a 
displacement from the organic and the human to the crystal. It is also, espe- 
cially, a penetration of the crystalline by the impulse, the human, and the 
plenitude constructed there. When the conditions for the order of freedom 
cease to be partial, the road will finally open again toward the unity of physi- 
cal construction and organic ornament, for the joy of ornament. Realiter will 
open for the first time, without Egypt here and Gothic there, that is, without 
what is that way being called crystal or tree of life having to continue alter- 
nating, mixing with each other, or envying each other mutually. The crystal is 
the frame, more, the horizon of serenity, but the ornament of the tree of 
human life is the only real content of this serenity and surrounding clarity. 
The best world that expresses and reproduces in advance the grand architec- 
tonic style exists thus, totally a-mythic, as a real thing committed vivis ex 
lapidibus, from the stones of life." 

Without in any way disdaining the formal correspondences through which we 
can relate the work of Gonzalez with that of Klee, as Tucker has done, I think the 
concurrence of their ideals and attitudes is particularly important, especially when 
analyzed in the context of the crisis of the avant-garde of the 1930s, in the same way 
it obviously exists among the other artists in the present exhibition. 

In addition, the nocturnal landscape is a recurring theme throughout almost 
all of Klee's artistic career. Klee found himself as an artist during his trip to Tunis 
in 19 14. On Easter Sunday (April 12) in St. Germain, on the eve of his voyage, he

experienced the following revelation when he was looking at the sky at sunset, as he 
noted in his Diary: 

The evening is indescribable. And on top of everything else a full moon came 
up. Louis urged me to paint it. I said: it will be an exercise at best. Naturally I 
am not up to this kind of nature. Still, I know a bit more than I did before. I 
know the disparity between my inadequate resources and nature. This is an 
internal affair to keep me busy for the next few years. It doesn't trouble me 
one bit. No use hurrying when you want so much. 

The evening is deep inside me forever. Many a blond, northern moon 
rise, like a lauted reflection, will softly remind me, and remind me again and 
again. It will be my bride, my alter ego. An incentive to find myself. I myself 
am the moonrise of the South. 56 

The summer 1938 issue of the magazine Verve (no. 3) included a double-page 
spread with reproductions of works by Klee; the first is a drawing of a stellar con- 
stellation in whose reduced center there is a circle bearing the words Sommeil d'hiver, 
A few pages earlier, there is a constellation in a lithograph by Miro, but with a title 
dedicated to summer. In the preceding issue (spring 1938), the corresponding dou- 
ble-page spread features works by Kandinsky— constellations with the title Etoiles. In 
the same issue, opposite an extract from an essay by Georges Bataille called Corps 
celestes,'' is an allusive lithograph by Andre Masson. 

Klee's late works tend toward a figurative expressionism dominated by the 
images of angels or demons populating the heavens and hell, the high altitudes and 
below ground.' 8 The relationship between form and content, action as an event that 
temporalizes and thus dramatizes the picture, and the importance of line bring 
these works closer to those critical problems in which the avant-garde of the 1930s 
developed. 

The pivotal figure at the center of the crisis of the avant-garde and its 
"semantification" is Picasso. In 1935, Cabiers d'art (no. 10) published notes on art in 
which Picasso declared that, in his case, "painting is a cluster of destructions," and 
went on to generalize about abstract art: 

Abstract art is nothing more than painting. Where is the drama? Abstract art 
does not exist. We must always begin with something; then we can remove all 
trace of reality Then there is no danger, because the idea of the object will 
have left an indelible mark. It is what incited the artist, stimulated his ideas, 



83 



and aroused his emotions. After all, ideas and emotions will remain caught in 
his work. No matter what they do, they cannot escape from the picture, of 
which they form an integral part, even though their presence cannot be 
detected. Man, whether he likes it or not, is the instrument of nature, which 
imposes on him his aspect and characteristics. In my Dinard and Pourville 
pictures, I was expressing a vision very similar to this one. . . . You can't go 
against nature: it is more powerful than the strongest man! We can allow our- 
selves certain liberties, but only in the matter of details. Nor does there exist a 
figurative or a non-figurative art: everything appears to us in the form of 
figures. Even metaphysical ideas are expressed through symbolic figures; their 
effect on us can be more or less intense. 59 

Picasso's declarations agree with a Picasso quotation Gonzalez loved: no one 
can draw a perfect circle. In any case, what Picasso says about the ineluctable link 
between the artist and some aspect of reality, which the artist can then reduce or dis- 
figure, is also in perfect harmony with Gonzalez's usual method of creation, as 
Rosalind Krauss has pointed out: 

Thus, if the gathering forces for abstract art had advertised the conditions of 
twentieth-century aesthetics as a struggle between abstraction and naturalism, 
spirit and matter, conception and representation, culture and nature, 
Gonzalez was forced to acknowledge that he was unwilling to take sides 
against nature. Trained as he was in the arts of decoration, and trained to 
think of the decorative as a modality of the frivolous, Gonzalez's term of 
highest praise for that which was truly art was that it was "serious." And for 
him, an art that completely abandoned nature could not be serious. 60 
Krauss goes on to compare Gonzalez's method, which committed him to draw from 
nature, with that of Picasso, and illustrates this comparison by analyzing the creative 
process in Gonzalez's Woman Combing Her Hair I (ca. 193 1). Comparing the sketch 
and the finished sculpture reveals that the differences between them are insignifi- 
cant. According to Krauss, such a process of "abstraction," beginning with a first 
realistic image, was antithetical to "Picasso's improvised assemblage." 6 ' 

Early in her essay, Krauss quotes Gonzalez's statements against abstraction 
"not directly inspired in nature," 62 particularly geometrical abstraction. These state- 
ments are from a 1931 manuscript entitled "Picasso sculpteur et les cathedrales"; 
some of it is strikingly similar to Picasso's own critique of abstraction, published in

1935. Here, Gonzalez once again shows himself to have been the faithful and 
respectful transcriber of Picasso's opinions. Of course, that does not mean that their 
working and creative methods were identical. Moreover, what for Gonzalez was the 
essential factor in his definitive artistic conception was only an episode for Picasso. 

Another example of the correspondence of their ideas may be found by com- 
paring Picasso's statement about celestial maps, related to Sabartes, to Gonzalez's 
notion of the stars as an inspiration for a new art of "drawing in space" (both are 
quoted above). Christa Lichtenstern, in her brief but rigorous monograph on 
Picasso's Monument to Apollinaire, not only emphasizes this textual concurrence but 
analyzes in detail, beginning with the 1924 book of drawings, the entire series of 
related patterns that Picasso completed between then and 1928, which unifies and 
gives coherence to the exploration of this new art of "drawing in space." 
Lichtenstern also examines Picasso's oeuvre in terms of the antecedents and histori- 
cal consequences of this idea in other artists' drawings, sculptures, and paintings.'" 
But I think it possible to go further into the idea from a "poetic" and not merely 
formal perspective. The disquiet revealed by Picasso through his drawings and sculp- 
tures of the late 1920s is closely related to what he revealed through his illustrations 
for "The Unknown Masterpiece," as well as its echoes in some of the other series of 
etchings that came to form the so-called Suite Vollard, especially that part of it relat- 
ed to the theme of the "Sculptor's Studio" (see note 33). 

The self-absorption of the artist in the studio and the pure formal analysis 
that dangerously distances the creator from reality, ultimately driving him mad, are 
certainly the elements in Balzac's novel that most interested Picasso and other 
important avant-garde artists of the Modern era. This is at the heart of Picasso's 
statement from the year 1923, where he confesses the danger that stalks the Modern 
artist who tries to "paint the invisible." 

One must consider all this against the background of the historical context in 
which Picasso and Gonzalez lived and thought, just as Krauss does in the following 
passage about Gonzalez: 

The aesthetic battle lines of the 1920s and 1930s were drawn through the 
mimetic/abstract axis. But further, these terms were understood as fronts for 
another set of terms, namely matter and spirit. Any avant-garde text from this 
time— Constructivist, Neo-Plasticist, Abstraction-Creationist, Surrealist— will 
describe the actual aesthetic struggle as a war between the physical and the 



85 



conceptual, a duality that we have no trouble translating further into 
mind/body. Gonzalez was, intellectually, a creature of his time, and therefore 
when setting out to verbalize his aesthetic invention he used the current terms 
of the debate. . . . This combination, this marriage of body and spirit, 
Gonzalez goes on to call "ennobling," a term that is entirely appropriate for 
the marriage in question. For like the yolk and white of the Platonic image, 
the noble offspring of this marriage is Man. 

Thus the aesthetic field, as it was structured by the thinking of the 
twenties and thirties, was the collective semantic marker not for Art but for 
Man. The field was both thoroughly humanized and psychologized, its obses- 
sive subjects either biological or psychic creation. Although a field agonized 
by the warring rights of abstraction and representation might seem to be 
defining the domain of the aesthetic, those terms functioned in fact to define 
the combined terrain of psyche and soma, the structural unity of Man. 
Furthermore, this was man in his essential or natural state, man as a function 
of nature rather than a product of culture. 64 
Here, Krauss presents a magnificent synthesis of what constituted and gave meaning 
to the aesthetic domain of the period between the wars. Her description of "man as 
a function of nature" recalls the monologue of Antoine Roquentin, the protagonist 
of Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea (1937) as he contemplates the small city of Bouville 
from a hilltop. Roquentin feels nauseated by the regularity of bourgeois life. First he 
parodies the ridiculous customs that govern the predictable actions of each one of 
the citizens of Bouville and then finishes his reflection as follows: 

And all this time, great, vague nature has slipped into their city, it has infil- 
trated everywhere, in their house, in their office, in themselves. It doesn't 
move, it stays quietly and they are full of it inside, they breathe it, and they 
don't see it, they imagine it to be outside, twenty miles from the city. I see it, I 
see this nature ... I know that its obedience is idleness, I know it has no laws: 
what they take for constancy is only habit and it can change tomorrow. 6 ' 
The only escape the desolate Roquentin finds, although it is equivocal, is that 
of the aesthetic domain, which leads him to think of writing a book: 

Couldn't I try [ . . . ] in another medium? ... It would have to be a book: I 
don't know how to do anything else. But not a history book: history talks 
about what has existed— one existence can never justify the existence of anoth-

In 1930, Sigmund Freud published Civilization and Its Discontents, in whose 
final paragraph he asserts: "And now it is to be expected that the other of the two 
'Heavenly Powers,' eternal Eros, will make an effort to assert himself in the struggle 
with his equally immortal adversary. But who can foresee with what success and 
with what result?" 6 " In 1932, Louis-Ferdinand Celine published, to great success, his 
Voyage au bout de la nuit. And, in 1939, the young and engage English poet Stephen 
Spender published a book of his poems from that decade, including "The 
Uncreating Chaos," in which the following lines appear: 

Beyond the blacked-out windows of our nightmare 
Facts race their hundred miles an hour 
In iron circles on an iron plain. . . . 68 
Besides Picasso, with his funerary monument dedicated to the memory of 
Apollinaire, which served as a definitive stimulus for Gonzalez's artistic realizations, 
there are two other contemporary artists who exercised a positive influence on him: 
the Uruguayan Joaquin Torres-Garcia and the Italian Alberto Magnelli. Both, in 
principle, were totally committed to the Abstraction-Creation group. Torres-Garcia 
and Gonzalez had been friends since youth and comrades in the artistic bohemia of 
fin-de-siecle Barcelona. They also shared an artisanal background and an obsession 
for giving meaning to decorative elements. 

Torres-Garcia was strongly influenced by pre-Columbian art, which he discov- 
ered in 1928. This discovery marked his work in the early 1930s, through which he 
developed his concept of "constructive universalism." 6 '' A combination of a kind of 
Cubist composition and a chromatic range similar to the principles of Neo- 
Plasticism, Torres-Garcia's painting focused for a time on schematic motifs related 
to urban life and, later, on little figures and signs inspired by pre-Columbian art. 
The tones became more and more muted and opaque, while the monochromatic, 
archaic character of the figures give to his work an air that recalls folk art in clay: a 
compact and tactile background subtly "spiritualized" with the superimposed mesh- 
work of figures. This idiom corresponded to more than one aspect of what 



87 



Gonzalez was doing, especially in the tension between the physical presence of the 
"real" elements and the more "abstract," geometrical elements. 70 

Gonzalez's relationship with Magnelli, beginning in 1934, was also close. The 
two had friends in common, such as Christian Zervos and the Spaniard Luis 
Fernandez, and, as the art historian Margit Rowell has pointed out, Gonzalez was 
particularly fascinated by a series of paintings Magnelli was creating under the gen- 
eral title Shattered Stones. According to a statement made by Magnelli's widow and 
recorded by Rowell, it seems that Gonzalez was a frequent visitor to Magnelli's stu- 
dio in Villa Seurat and that he once declared while standing in front of Magnelli's 
paintings that he would like to make a sculpture like the paintings in the Shattered 
Stones series/' 

With Fernandez (whose personal discretion, as with Gonzalez, has unneces- 
sarily held back the later recognition of his true artistic value), Gonzalez felt a great 
moral and aesthetic identification. An account of this affinity may be found in an 
article by Fernandez in a 1932 issue of the important Spanish avant-garde magazine 
A. C. Documentos de Actividad Contempordnea, of which twenty-five issues appeared 
between 193 1 and 1937. These are the most politically significant dates of that period 
in Spain: in 1931 the Second Republic was proclaimed, and 1937— the year of the 
Paris World's Fair— was the bloody midpoint of the Civil War, when the balance 
between the two sides was clearly shifting in favor of Franco's Nationalist troops. 
Fernandez's article is one of the few at that time that warmly proclaimed the impor- 
tance of Gonzalez, and the only one to speak in his defense in Spain. It was illus- 
trated with three photographs of sculptures by Gonzalez: Composition (probably 
193 1 ); The Kiss I (1930); and Couple /The Embrace (probably 1927-29). 

Of particular interest is how Fernandez interpreted the transformation of 
Gonzalez's work after the sculpture of the late 1920s, attributing the change to the 
Catalan artist's return to his Hispanic roots after having lived for decades under the 
spell of French art: 

The change brought about in him was of such intensity that it seemed for a 
moment that this Spanish-born sculptor was going to create works of the 
purest French spirit. But when he gave himself over completely to his work, 
the racial traits of his ancestors were reborn in him, and through his iron 
hammer Arabs, Phoenicians, Greeks, Jews, and Catalonians worked once 
again. 7 '

Julio Gonzalez" in A. C. Documentos de Actividad 
Contemporanea s (first quarter, 1932).

France, ca. 1036-39. 



Fernandez not only affirmed the importance of Gonzalez's art but prophetically 
suggested that his work might be subject to the same incomprehension suffered by 
the by-then-deceased Gris: 

The work of Gonzalez is one of the most solid and most beautiful elements 
in the future edifice the younger generation is building, though generally 
unrecognized in Spain, where only his imitators are known. The same thing 
happened with the paintings of Juan Gris, whose importance has barely been 
understood by anyone in Spain, before or after his death. ' 
Fernandez and Gonzalez were not only friends but were linked by other artis- 
tic affinities. Fernandez came to Paris in 1924, and his first avant-garde phase there 
was marked by the influence of the Purism of Amedee Ozenfant and Le Corbusier. 
Later he evolved, logically, toward Neo-Plasticism and the ideals defended by the 
Abstraction-Creation group, an artistic trajectory that explains his admiration for 
Gris and his intimate understanding of the work of Torres-Garcia and Gonzalez. At 
the same time, his relationship with Picasso was also close, and they even collaborat- 
ed. Fernandez's work during the 1930s is the best reflection of these ideals and is 
marked by an insistence on the compact, on geometric volumes of tubular, cylindri- 
cal, or prismatic shape, as well as monochromism and rough texture. The phrase sat- 
isfaction hallucinatoire, which Fernandez used to describe his work in an article pub- 
lished in 1935, 4 expresses the notion of some kind of geometric spirit paradoxically 
nurtured by a strange fire, and reinforces what we could call a kind of curious amal- 
gam of abstraction and Surrealism. This strange hybrid was practiced by other 
Spanish artists too, who were also members of the School of Paris, such as Bores, 
Caneja, and Cossio; all of whom, like Gris and Torres-Garcia, recall Zurbaran. 

This mixture of geometry and Surrealism has been studied by Valeriano 
Bozal, who emphasizes Fernandez's affirmation that the images respond, with that 
satisfaction hallucinatoire, to the desires that form in the human subconscious."' 
Beginning in the 1940s, Fernandez not only abandoned abstraction but poured 
forth the ardent silence that had been incubating in his earlier work, manifesting 
even more the subterranean links of aesthetic complicity with Gonzalez. 

This tension between the abstract and the figurative, the organic and the crys- 
talline, as well as the underlying, disturbing spirit of hallucination that marks cer- 
tain episodes in the work of Torres-Garcia, Fernandez, and Gonzalez himself are not 
so far from those manifested by Picasso. In his case, however, the tension is pro- 



89 



duced in a more dramatically violent and disconcerting fashion, and should be 
interpreted as a dialectic between what Worringer calls Abstraction and Empathy, 
which fit Picasso's contradictory nature so well. 6 

On January 4, 1936, Cahiers d'art published an extraordinary monographic 
issue dedicated to Picasso. The issue contains photographs of a great number of his 
works produced between 1930 and 1935, along with articles by such French luminar- 
ies as Breton, Eluard, Hugnet, Man Ray, Peret, and Zervos, and such Spanish artists 
as Dalf, Fernandez, Gonzalez, and Sabartes, with the articles of the last two being 
closest to what we could call the spirit of Picasso. In the article by Fernandez, "Art 
sur-descriptif et art non-figuratif," the tense boundaries between abstraction and fig- 
uration are clearly defined. After rejecting banal abstraction as a simple non-figura- 
tive form of art, and after definitively rejecting the idea that Picasso's work could in 
any way be called abstract, he writes: 

But in all these cases, without exception, the choice and coordination of the 
plastic elements arise from their similarities with the latent subjects of the 
painting, hence from their power of representation, their power to form 
images, which makes them clearly contrary to any abstract intentions. For the 
same reason, abstract intentions cannot, in their ultimate consequences, be 
realized, and the desire to follow them leads to the gradual suppression of the 
vital elements of the work. . . . Here we see, according to the given facts, 
wherein lies the fundamental difference between the two tendencies that we 
call abstract: on the one hand, we have a suppression of the evocation of the 
external world; on the other hand, we have instead a broadening of this evo- 
cation, by bringing in psychic images whose connections to external objects 
can vary from the most remote allusion to the most exact, complete descrip- 
tion. . . . Rarely is a label, when applied to art works, not a source of confu- 
sion. Ever since the beginning of Cubism, pedants disguised as theoreticians 
have thrown themselves upon it and smothered whatever joy, whatever libera- 
tion of the instincts, it once contained, to the benefit of whatever restrictive 
qualities it had— though not in Picasso, of course. And only by means of 
maneuvers that one might call abortive can one infer the nothingness of so- 
called pure plastics to be a consequence of Cubism."

Cover of Cahiers d' art, January 4, 1936, special issue 
devoted to Picasso's work of ipjo-jS- 



his celebrated text "La beaute sera convulsive") included an article by E. Teriade 
stating that one of the common traits of the art of the moment is "the impassioned 
search for movement in plastic expression": 

From pathetic expression to Dionysiac expression, all is movement, undula- 
tion, gyration, a delirium of intricate rhythms in space to evoke time; even 
the sculpture that, twisted and nervous, opens up, explodes, shatters its primi- 
tive mass and breaks up into transparent gestures . . . has nothing comparable 
to the immutable fixity of an irrevocable, and static, art. 79 
Among the illustrations accompanying the article, there is a two-page spread, one 
half of which is filled with photographs of four metal sculptures by Jacques 
Lipchitz, the other with four figurative pieces by Pablo Gargallo. Another page is 
given over to Giacometti's Head of a Man and Pavilion Nocturne and Picasso's Figure 
(cat. no. 32). Figure, one of three sculptures that Picasso made of iron, string, and 
wood in 193 1, evokes a strange plant with a metal trunk and frayed leaves. If we take 
the spool used as a base to be a pedestal, what it supports is a statue of a pathetic 
figure whose body is made of twisted barbed wire. 

These works by Lipchitz and Gargallo and Picasso's strange, violent sculpture 
are the best proof that the direction created approximately half a dozen years before 
by Picasso and Gonzalez had managed to catch on in "perceptive" terms. That is, 
not only had it managed to inspire or interest other artists— and in this sense I share 
Werner Spies's opinion that Picasso's drawings of 1927 and 1928 had a direct influ- 
ence on Giacometti's sculpture between 1929 and 1932— but, as may be seen in the 
visual composition of Minotaure, it had managed to prepare the eye of the viewer. 

The significance of this proliferation of iron as a prominent material in the 
sculpture of the 1930s has been analyzed by Josephine Withers, 80 who calls particular 
attention, quite properly, to the work of Calder, Giacometti, Leger, Lipchitz, and 
Miro. She also mentions Brancusi, pointing out how his polished bronzes sought a 
luminosity and transparency in sculpture by a system completely opposed to the 
drawings in space of Gonzalez. In this sense, I also agree with Tomas Llorens, in 
whose view Brancusi represents the culmination of the Western classical tradition, 
while Gonzalez— together with Picasso— creates the basis lor what will be the new 
sculpture of the postwar era. 

A decisive event marked Giacometti's artistic development. According to the 
artist himself, he had abandoned using real models alter 1925, but ten years later, in 



91 



I935&gt; decided to return to a more realistic mode, causing confusion and incompre- 
hension among his Surrealist friends. Some of the most important members of the 
group condemned this new orientation, which was later termed "retour a la figura- 
tion," 1 " and which covers the period 1933 to 1945. If we examine Giacometti's writ- 
ings and statements of the 1930s we see, beyond any Surrealist rhetoric, an obsession 
with the hallucinatory dimension of reality, conceived in terms of a tension some- 
what similar to that evinced in the sculptures of Gonzalez and Picasso. 82 

Calder had been working with wire as the material for his comic little circus 
figures since the end of the 1920s. From 1943 to 1945 he created his series of 
Constellations, whose title he took, as he said, from the series of gouaches Miro creat- 
ed between 1940 and 194 1. Calder's Constellations were conceived as assemblages of 
abstract forms created from colored wood and connected by wires, which were also 
colored. The pieces could be set on the ground or suspended in the air. They echo 
Mondrian and Miro, but most of all the series reveals a breath of poetic mysticism, 
of "evasion" in the Surrealist sense— an element that was smiling, playful, and even 
rather sarcastic— which was not the most frequent characteristic of Calder's work. 
What might have influenced him to take this direction was the tragic course of 
events at that moment, something beyond the merely plastic influences previously 
mentioned. In this sense, we must recall that Calder's relationship with the Spanish 
avant-garde was very close, especially with Miro, and he was the only foreigner 
whose work was included in the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World's Fair. 

And yet, Calder, like his compatriot David Smith (and both of them in con- 
tradistinction to Giacometti), did not have a "religious" or tragic attitude toward 
sculpture. Each one, in his own way, expressed a "secularized," humorous, or, at 
least, ironic, point of view. Smith was one of the first artists to understand the 
importance and potential aesthetic implications of Gonzalez's iron sculpture, as he 
did that of Giacometti. But he knew how to reinterpret both in an original, secular 
key, draining their work of their passionate tensions. This entailed an ability to 
bring into practice a brilliant syntactic analysis, while hallucination opened the way 
to a modern sense of irony that was more critical and worldly, less scatological. This 
convergence of the religious and the secular, the metaphysical and the worldly, the 
tragic and the comic, all of it worked out through a non-constructive use of iron— 
during a period aptly described by the phrase "tempest of steel" (the title of Ernest 
Junger's account of his experiences in the apocalypse of World War I)— constitutes

one of the greatest attractions of the present exhibition. In it, under the tutelary 
shadow of Picasso, who was the Modern hero par excellence, the tragic-religious 
Gonzalez is the counterbalance to the secularizing Smith. Gonzalez and Smith are 
like two faces staring at each other in Modernity, directing their sight successively 
toward the past and the future. 

The realm of iron exists in the shadow of the mythological blacksmith 
Hephaestus (who the Romans called Vulcan), that unfortunate son of the goddess 
Hera. He was conceived through parthenogenesis and violently thrown from the 
heights of Olympus by his father Zeus, whether out of the shame his father felt for 
the lamentable appearance of the newborn baby or because of the secret moral 
insult he received for not participating in his conception. Whether he was deformed 
at birth or because of his fall from heaven— the classical sources do not agree on this 
point— the fact is that the lame and tragicomic Hephaestus was a great blacksmith 
and a most dexterous creator of invisible knots that not even the gods could escape. 
Coinciding with this mythological vision from the Greek pantheon of the 
celestial blacksmith, other, non-Western religions also agree on the idea of interpret- 
ing the discovery of iron with a gift fallen from heaven, a meteor, and in the tragic- 
sacrificial sense of that fall. All of which must recall to us the text by Gonzalez that 
appears at the outset of this essay. There, the Spanish sculptor, after evoking that 
stellar dimension of metallic drawing in space, also announced the need to transfig- 
ure its bloody use into an artistic purpose, by nature alien to death. 

The important problem to solve here is not only to wish to make a work 
which is harmonious and perfectly balanced— No! But to get this result by the 
marriage of material and space. By the union of real forms with imaginary 
forms, obtained and suggested by established points, or by perforation— and, 
according to the natural law of love, to mingle them and make them insepa- 
rable, one from another, as are the body and the spirit.*' 
In this way, under the constellation of the blacksmith, we reach the end of this cen- 
tral story of contemporary sculpture, which begins and ends in fire, a fire that 
semantically puts new life into the dying embers of an avant-garde in crisis during 
the 1930s. Like a phoenix, it will rise from those ashes after World War II.

of Christian Zervos's celebrated magazine, devoted entirely to Picasso's Guernica, there are also articles 
by Jean Cassou, Georges Dutuit, Pierre Mabille, Paul Eluard, and Michel Leiris. Bergamin's point was 
not merely to emphasize Picasso's rage about a local massacre, but what it meant in symbolic terms. 
Bergamin states that he would prefer to think that Picasso, having been moved by the bombing of the 
Basque village, was creating an homage in his picture to the resistance of those defending Madrid at 
the time. This of course has led to countless debates in Spain, where national identities have been and 
continue to be polemical. In that context, see writings by Juan Larrea, Guernica (Madrid, 1977), and 
Josep Palau i Fabre, El Guernica de Picasso (Barcelona, 1 979). 

6. Much has been written about the relationship between Picasso's Guernica and Goya's Moncloa 
Executions. Among the more notable studies are those by Juan Larrea and, especially, Andre Malraux, 
who wrote essays on Goya and Picasso (Saturne: Essai sur Goya and La Tete d'Obsidienne). The organic 
unity of Malraux's critical treatment of both is surprising, even when he doesn't make the relationship 
between them explicit by means of comparisons. He could dare to think about a future democratic 
Spain when he published La Tete d'Obsidienne, even though Franco was still in power— a Spain where 
the two pictures could be hung opposite each other in the Prado. See Francisco Calvo Serraller,

Peret of the Surrealist journal. Breton's reaction was instantaneous: he took the editorship of the mag- 
azine away from Naville, and in the next issue began a series of articles that he called "Surrealism and 
Painting" (1925-28). See Francisco Calvo Serraller, "La teoria artistica del surrealismo," in Imdgenes de 
lo instgntjicante: el destino histonco de las vanguardias en el arte contemporaneo (Madrid, 1987), p. 172 
and passim.

PP- 43-74- 

20. Despite the repugnance that Breton felt for music in general and for ballet in particular, when 
Picasso's Mercure opened on June 18, 1924, and some of Breton's friends dared to ridicule it, he 
immediately organized an homage to the painter by way of apology. This is all the more astounding 
when we note Breton's violent reaction to Max Ernst and Miro when they decided to collaborate with 
Diaghilev two years later. 

21. These statements were made to Mario de Zayas and published in The Arts in 1923. The quotations are 
taken from Picasso: poemas y declaraciones (Mexico, 1944), pp. 27, 28. 

22. Pablo Picasso, "Letter on Art," originally published in the magazine Ogonek 20 (Moscow, May 16, 
1926). It was also published in Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration, vol. 58 (Darmstadt, 1926). The passage 
I have quoted is taken from Picasso: pintura y realidad; textos, declaraciones, entrevistas, ed. by Juan Flo 
(Montevideo, 1973), pp. 57-58. 

23. Albert Boime, Van Gogh: La Nuit etoilee, L'histoire de la mature et la matiere de Vhistoire (Paris, 1990). 

24. Retrospectives of van Gogh's work were held in Paris in 1901 and 1905. Gonzalez moved to Paris in 
1900, and Picasso went there for extended visits in 1900, 1901, and several times more before settling 
there in 1904. However, it is unlikely that they knew of van Gogh's correspondence with his brother 
Theo and with Emile Bernard, which appeared in Mercure de France beginning in 1893 and which 
contains numerous references to the subject of the stars. 

25. Among the most widely known works by Flammarion are Histoire du del (Paris, 1881); Monde avant la 
creation de I'homme (Paris, 1886); and LAstronomie (Paris, 1889).

"Silence was the only thing there was about this beautiful country until the Romantic school 
made it fashionable through Victor Hugo's Orientaux, Alfred de Musset's Contes, the Theatre de 
Clara Gazul, and Merimee's Nouvel/es. Studies were carried out on the Romancero, the works of 
Calderon, and since poetry rapidly stimulated interest in the other arts, Spanish painting began to 
be looked into. ... In a logical reaction against the pseudo-classical taste that still held sway as 
much in painting as in poetry, people turned toward the Middle Ages, cathedrals, knights in shin- 
ing armor . . . and no country expressed that knightly, Catholic ideal better than Spain . . . Spain 
is the Romantic country par excellence; no other nation has taken less from Antiquity."

42. An example of this can be found in Jose Maria Roviralta's article "La regeneracion estetica de 
Esparia," published in the Modernist magazine Luz (Barcelona) in the third week of November 1898: 
Our race is degenerate; we are losing energy and the proof of this is the very indifference with 
which we view everything and let everything happen . . . Change is imposed on us, our rachitic 
race is worn out, civilization, progress, the world needs energy to burn, lungs to weaken, and new 
life to consume in its work. Let these energies come, let these lungs come and this new life that 
the world needs to fly through the air and run and lose itself in the depth of a road it doesn't 
know; let an impulse come so that the world will not stop; stay behind you effeminate spirits, and 
let him who can follow his rapid pace. Indillerence: get back! Open the way! Open the way for 
the spirit ol the north! 
By the same token, if we examine what was then being praised in the avant-garde magazines of that

fin-de-siecle Barcelona, which shaped the young Picasso and Julio Gonzalez as well, we find the fol- 
lowing names: Beardsley, Bjorson, Crane, Dostoyevsky, Grieg, Ibsen, Kierkegaard, Maeterlink, 
Nordau, Ruskin, Strindberg, Tolstoy, Wagner, Whistler, and Wilde, along with those of the French 
Symbolists. And as an ideological foundation, we see the thought of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche 
together with all the theoreticians of anarchism. See Francisco Calvo Serraller, "Edvard Munch y 
Espana, una afinidad excentrica," in Pintores espanoles entre dos fines de sigh (Madrid, 1990), pp. 85-90. 

43. See Eliade's Forgerons et alchimistes (Spanish trans.: Herreros y alquimistas, Madrid, 1974). Especially 
interesting, because of their resonance in what has been said here about Gonzalez's ideas about "draw- 
ing in space" and the theme of the constellations, are Eliade's ideas about the celestial origin of iron, 
a theme he develops in the first chapter, "Meteorites and Metallurgy." 

44. See Rosa Lopez Torrijos, La milologia en la pintura espanola del sigh de oro (Madrid, 1985), pp. 334-37.

46. Miro, quoted by R. Penrose in Miro (Barcelona, 1976), pp. 101-02. 

47. There are two interesting aspects of this sculpture by Alberto Sanchez (Toledo, 1885; Moscow, 1962): 
the fact that it was the concrete realization of the series of drawings he conceived as monumental pro- 
jects while he waited for funding, such as those entitled Monument to Birds, Sculpture of the Horizon, 
Monument to Children, etc., and the fact of its being telluric, a horizontal that becomes vertical. See 
Josep Renau, Arte en peligro, 1956-1939 (Valencia, 1980), p. 22; J. Alix Trueba, Escultura espanola ipoo- 
1936 (Madrid, 1985), pp. 165-76; and Pabelhn Espanol. Exposicion Internaaonal de Paris 1937, pp. 88- 
90. Aside from being obsessed throughout his career with themes related to the flight of birds, starry 
nights, and ascent, Sanchez also used such phrases as "drilling space" or "volumes that fly" to describe 
his work. See Alberto Sanchez, Palahras de un escultor (Valencia, 1975).

69. See Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Historia de mi vida (Barcelona, 1990), pp. 190-234. There he relates his 
activities in Paris between 1928 and 1932. Of special interest is what he says about his old friend 
Julio Gonzalez (p. 217 and passim): 

What was Gonzalez doing in Paris? There seemed to hang over him an incurable discontent, a 

skepticism about everything, almost a depression, completely stifling him. Knowing all Paris, he 

seemed to hide himself, willfully withdrawing from everything, abandoning every intention to act 

in a determined way. That's how he was. And Torres tried to bring him out, to stimulate him, by 

pulling him out of that swamp. He had good pieces in his studio (it was he who taught Gargallo 

and others, and he who forged, perhaps improving them, Picasso's iron sculptures). And having 

all that, could he remain stuck in his corner? 

What Torres-Garcia says in the next passage is a venomous attack on Picasso's moral character, one 

that fails to recognize not only that Gonzalez did not share his negative opinion but that he was not 

convinced by Torres-Garcia. For Torres-Garcia's writings on art, see Universalismo constructivo, 2 vols. 

(Madrid, 1984).

&lt; Alexander Calder's Mercury Fountain on view 
in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's 
Fair, 1937. 



1876 

September 21 Julio Gonzalez is born in 
Barcelona, Spain. 
1881 

October 25 Pablo Picasso is born in Malaga, 
Spain. 
1898 

July 22 Alexander Calder is born in Philadelphia. 
ca. 1897-99 

Julio Gonzalez and his older brother Joan frequent 
the Barcelona cafe Els Quatre Gats. Other artists 
who attend include painters Ramon Casas, Picasso, 
Santiago Rusinol, and Joaquin Torres-Garcia and 
sculptor Manolo Hugue, among others. 
1899 

Julio and Joan Gonzalez move to Paris, where they 
maintain their friendship with Picasso. Julio 
Gonzalez and Picasso devote themselves chiefly to 
painting. Gonzalez later meets Picasso's friends 
Francisco [Paco] Durrio and Pablo Gargallo, who 
are metal sculptors, as well as Max Jacob, Andre 
Salmon, and Maurice Raynal. Gonzalez also comes 
to know Constantin Brancusi. 
1901 

October 10 Alberto Giacometti is born in 
Borgonovo, Gnsons, Switzerland. 
Picasso shares Gonzalez's living quarters in Paris 
while he looks for a studio. 
1902 

Summer Gonzalez and Picasso meet in Barcelona 
and Picasso draws Gonzalez's portrait. 
1903 

Picasso goes back to Barcelona again in January and 
stays there until spring of 1904. 
1904 

Spring Picasso returns to Pans. In Montmartre, he 
moves into a studio building, which becomes 
known as the Bateau-Lavoir. 

August 23 In a letter to Picasso, Julio Gonzalez 
responds to a quarrel that has occurred between 



Joan and Picasso. The relationship between Picasso 
and Gonzalez is disrupted for a number of years 
following this incident (letter from Gonzalez to 
Picasso, MP Archives). 

Fall Picasso meets Salmon and, some months later, 
befriends Guillaume Apollinaire. Along with Jacob, 
they become Picasso's closest friends and the first 
defenders of Cubism, later to be joined by Pierre 
Reverdy. 
1906 

Picasso becomes familiar with pre-Roman Iberian 
sculpture at the Louvre (in an exhibition of recently 
excavated sculpture from Osuna and Cerro de los 
Santos). His paintings soon reflect their robust pro- 
portions and archaic features. 

March 9 David Smith is born in Decatur, Indiana. 
Spring Picasso meets Henri Matisse, and then 
Andre Derain. 
1907 

Picasso begins painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 
April-May. In May or June he discovers historic 
African sculpture at the Musee ethnographique du 
Trocadero. Unknown to Picasso, African sculpture 
is already being collected by Derain, Maurice de 
Vlaminck, and Matisse. He finishes Demoiselles in 
early July. Picasso meets dealer Daniel-Henry 
Kahnweiler that summer. Picasso and Georges 
Braque are introduced by Apollinaire in October or 
November. 

March-April Gonzalez exhibits paintings, includ- 
ing Mother and Child, in the Salon des 
Independants, Paris. 
1908 

Gonzalez is deeply affected by the death of his 
brother Joan. Experiencing a profound crisis, he 
isolates himself and ceases to work: "He abandoned 
his work for many months, refused to see his 
friends. He quarreled with Picasso" (Roberta 
Gonzalez, "Julio Gonzalez, My Father," in Arts 30, 
no. 5, p. 22). 



257 



Picasso and Braque form a closer relationship. 
When Braque shows his landscapes at Galerie 
Kahnweiler, Paris, critics speak of "cubes" and the 
term "cubism" is coined. 
1909 

Gonzalez exhibits paintings at the Salon d'Automne 
and Salon de la Nationale, Paris. 
Summer Picasso travels to Barcelona, and to Horta 
de Ebro for the second time, where he paints land- 
scapes and portraits that mark the beginning of 
Analytic Cubism. He also starts experimenting with 
sculpture. 

September or October Picasso moves into a stu- 
dio and apartment at 11, boulevard de Clichy, 
where he lives with Fernande Olivier. 
Fall Picasso models his Head 0/ a Woman, a 
sculpted portrait of Olivier closely related to his 
drawings and paintings in the Analytic Cubist style, 
in Gonzalez's studio in Pans. Of this work, Picasso 
said: "I thought the curves you see on the surface 
should continue in the interior. I had the idea of 
doing them in wire, (but) it was too intellectual, too 
much like painting" (quoted in Roland Penrose, The 
Sculpture of Picasso, New York, 1 967, p. 1 9). 
1910 

Making a tentative return to sculpture following his 
crisis over the loss of his brother, Gonzalez pro- 
duces his first masks in metal repousse, an assem- 
blage of pieces of cut sheet metal. (He had received 
his training in metalwork from his father, a sculp- 
tor and goldsmith.) 

Picasso has a solo exhibition at Galerie Notre- 
Dame-des-Champs, Paris, and is included in a 
group show at Grafton Galleries, London. He and 
Braque are represented in group shows in 
Diisseldorf and Munich. 
191 1 

March 28-April 25 Pablo Picasso: An Exhibition of 
Early and Recent Drawings and Watercolors is held at 
the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (later 



renamed Gallery 291), New York. Selected by 
Edward Steichen, Mario de Zayas (author of the cat- 
alogue preface), and Frank Burty Havilland, this is 
the first exhibition of Picasso's work in the United 
States. Alfred Stieglitz, owner of the gallery, acquires 
the drawing Nude Woman of 19 10 (Z II, 208) from 
the show. 

Summer Picasso and Braque work in close collabo- 
ration in Ceret, in the French Pyrenees. 
1912 

Picasso takes part in the second exhibition of Der 
blaue Reiter at Galerie Goltz, Munich, and later 
exhibits at the Berliner Sezession. Spends the sum- 
mer with Braque in Sorgues, in the south of France. 
He moves with Eva Gouel from Montmartre to the 
Montparnasse area of Pans, and produces his first 
construction, Guitar, and first collage, Still Life with 
Chair Caning. Signs a three-year contract with 
Kahnweiler. 
1913 

Gonzalez takes a studio at 1, rue Leclerc, which he 
uses until 1920. 

February-March Picasso has eight works in the 
International Exhibition of Modern Art (the Armory 
Show) in New York. By spring, he is developing his 
Synthetic Cubist style. 

November Gonzalez participates in the Salon 
d'Automne, Paris, exhibiting one painting and one 
metal work. 

Apolhnaire publishes Les Peintres cubistes: Meditations 
esthetiques in Paris, becoming the champion of 
Cubism and very much involved with avant-garde 
art. 
1914 

August World War I begins. Apolhnaire, Braque, 
and Derain are conscripted. Picasso, in Avignon at 
the time, remains there until the fall, when he 
returns to Paris. 

Fall Gonzalez exhibits a bronze mask at the Salon 
d'Automne, and is appointed "societaire," allowing

him exhibition privileges. He also exhibits painting 
and metalwork at the Salon des Independants. 
December 9-January 9, 191 5 Picasso and Braque: 
An Exhibition of Recent Drawings and Paintings is 
held at Gallery 291, New York. 
1916 

Gonzalez exhibits three paintings and twelve 
repousse bronzes in the Salon des Independants. 
Apollinaire returns from the front, and Picasso 
draws several portraits of his friend, who has recent- 
ly become a French citizen. 

Summer Picasso moves from Montparnasse to 
Montrouge, a neighborhood directly south just out- 
side the city limits. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is 
shown publicly for the first time in Art moderne en 
France at the Salon d'Antin. 

Apollinaire publishes The Poet Assassinated, written 
between 19 10 and 191 5, in Paris. Its main charac- 
ter, the poet Cromamantal, may be interpreted as 
Apollinaire, and one of his best friends, "the Benin 
bird," as Picasso. When Cromamantal is assassinat- 
ed, the Benin bird has the idea of making a statue. 
Picasso and his friends organize a dinner party to 
celebrate the publication on December 31. 
1917 

Picasso goes to Rome for two months and works on 
his sets and costumes for the ballet Parade. While 
there, he meets and falls in love with Olga Koklova, 
a dancer in the Ballets Russes. The ballet debuts in 
Paris in May, to a negative response. 
1918 

June 10-September 26 Gonzalez works at La 
Soudure autogene francaise metalworks in the 
Renault plant at BouIogne-sur-Seine, where he 
learns oxyacetylene welding. He executes his first 
known work in iron by this method, "a little statue 
of Christ, forged in secret at the factory by this 
process" (Roberta Gonzalez, "Julio Gonzalez, My 
Father," p. 23). 
July Picasso marries Koklova. 



November 9 Picasso is deeply affected by the 
death of Apollinaire from Spanish influenza. Serge 
Ferat and other friends of Apollinaire decide to 
commission Picasso to create a monument to the 
dead poet. 

Mid-November Picasso and Koklova move to 23, 
rue La Boetie, on Paris's Right Bank. 
November 1 1: World War I ends. 
1919 

Calder graduates as a mechanical engineer from the 
Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New 
Jersey. From this year to 1922, he takes various 
apprentice engineering jobs. 

Picasso designs sets and costumes in London for the 
Ballets Russes performance of Tricorne, which opens 
in July. He works in both a Cubist and realist man- 
ner, and exhibits at Paul Rosenberg Gallery, Paris. 
1920 

January-May Picasso designs the sets and costumes 
for the Ballets Russes's Pulanella, which opens in 
Paris on May 1 5. 

November Gonzalez takes a metalworking studio 
at 18, rue d'Odessa. He exhibits in the Salle cata- 
lane at the Salon d'Automne, submitting three 
paintings, a silver sculpture titled Seated Woman (ca. 
191 8), two repousse masks in bronze and silver, and 
jewelry. He also exhibits works at the Salon 
d'Automne and the Salon de la Nationale. 
1921 

April Gonzalez exhibits paintings and two 
repousse bronzes at the Salon des Independants. 
The first monograph on Picasso's work, by Maurice 
Raynal, is published in Munich. 
May Picasso receives the official commission for 
his monument to Apollinaire, and a committee is 
created to raise financial support for the project. 
However, one of its members, the director of he 
Mercure de France, asks s'il n'y avait pas des gens trop 
bizarres dans le comite, des meteques, des cubistes, des 
bolchevistes, des dadai'stes et autres sortes de Boches (that 



259 



there not be anyone too bizarre on the committee- 
foreigners, Cubists, Bolsheviks, Dadaists, and other 
sorts of Germans) (Christa Lichtenstern, Picasso, 
Monument a Apollinaire: Projet pour une humcinisalion 
de Vespace, Paris, 1990, p. 14). 

Summer Picasso paints Three Women at the Spring 
and Three Musicians in classical and Cubist modes, 
respectively. 

October-November Gonzalez exhibits four paint- 
ings, four forged bronzes, one forged silver, and 
one sculpture (Eve, 1900-10) at the Salon 
d'Automne. One of the forged bronzes, Mask of 
Woman, is bought by the State for 1,000 francs. 
Picasso and Gonzalez reestablish contact around 
this time. 
19x2 

January 1 Giacometti arrives in Paris and enters 
the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere, where he 
studies for three years in Antoine Bourdelle's class. 
Collector Jacques Doucet buys Picasso's Demoiselles 
for 25,000 francs. 

March Gonzalez's first solo exhibition takes place 
at the Galene Povolovsky, Paris. It includes paint- 
ings, watercolors, drawings, sculpture, and jewelry, 
and is mentioned in Art News (May 25, in a review 
signed "M. C"). The catalogue preface is by 
Alexandre Mercereau, a lifelong supporter and 
friend of Gonzalez. 

May Gonzalez exhibits two portraits in bronze 
repousse (Roger and Jean de Neyreis, both 191 2-14) 
in the Salon de la Nationale, Paris. His work is 
mentioned by Gustave Kahn in he Mercure (May 
15). 

Calder begins to attend evening drawing classes at a 
public school on East Forty-second Street, New 
York, under Clinton Balmer. 
1923 

January 1-15 An exhibition of Gonzalez's jewelry, 
objets d'art, repousse bronzes, paintings, and sculp- 
tures is held at Galerie du Cameleon. 



Fall Calder enters the Art Students League, New 
York, where he will study until 1926. He works first 
under Kenneth Hayes Miller, and later with George 
Luks, Boardman Robinson, and John Sloan. 
Gonzalez exhibits in the Salon d'Automne, showing 
two paintings and an iron medallion commissioned 
by the Musee Pasteur. He also shows work in the 
Salon de la Nationale. 

November In New York, Paul Rosenberg/ 
Wildenstein Gallery exhibits sixteen recent works by 
Picasso. 
1924 

Picasso makes a large, painted metal construction, 
Guitar, and paints a series of monumental Synthetic 
Cubist still lifes. 

Summer In Juan-les-Pins, Picasso produces a 
sketchbook of ink dot-and-line drawings reminis- 
cent of constellations. 

October Andre Breton publishes his Manifeste du 
surrealisme (Surrealist manifesto) (Paris: Editions 
Sagitaire). 

Gonzalez moves his metalworking studio to 11, rue 
de Medeah, where he works until January 193 5. 
1925 

January 1 5 Two pages of Picasso's sketchbook of 
the previous summer are reproduced in La 
Revolution surrealiste (no. 2, pp. 16-17). 
Summer Smith works as a riveter on a frame 
assembly line in the Studebaker plant at South 
Bend, Indiana. This experience prepares him for his 
future production of iron sculpture, and gives him 
"a feeling for industrial forms, training in the han- 
dling of tools and factory equipment, and a sense of 
identification with working men" (Garnett McCoy, 
ed., David Smith, New York, 1973, p. 18). 
July 1 5 Picasso's Demoiselles is reproduced in La 
Revolution surrealiste. 

Giacometti ceases to use models and works instead 
from his imagination, a practice that he follows 
almost exclusively for ten years. The first works he

produces using this method {Torso, The Couple, 
1926, and Spoon Woman, 1926) show the influence 
of Cubism, especially as practiced by Henri Laurens 
and Jacques Lipchitz, as well as of African and 
Cycladic art. He sets up an atelier in Paris with his 
brother Diego, and participates for the first time in 
the Salon des Tuilenes, where he shows a sculpture. 
Calder makes drawings for the book Animal 
Sketching, which is published the following year. 
November Together with Jean Arp, Giorgio de 
Chirico, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Man Ray, Joan 
Miro, and others, Picasso takes part in the first 
Surrealist painting exhibition, La Peinture surrealiste, 
at Galerie Pierre, Pans. 

ca. 192.5 Calder makes his first wire sculptures. 
1926 

January Christian Zervos publishes the first issue 
of Cahiers d'art. 

Gonzalez exhibits at the Salon des Independants, 
submitting, among other works, two repousse 
bronzes of 1913. 

Commissioned by Ambroise Vollard to illustrate 
Honore de Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," 
Picasso translates his dot-and-line drawings from 
the summer of 1924 into woodcuts. 
May 16 A text attributed to Picasso is published in 
Moscow, in the magazine Ogonek. There is a direct 
relationship between its descriptive content and the 
dot-and-line drawings of 1924. 
Calder exhibits paintings at The Artist Gallery, New 
York. He begins wood carving. 

June Calder arrives in Paris and enters the 
Academie de la Grande Chaumiere. He begins his 
Circus and makes his first animated toys. 
ca. December After a year spent working in 
Washington, D.C., and taking poetry courses at 
George Washington University, Smith moves to 
New York and begins to attend classes at the Art 
Students League. 
Giacometti begins a series of thin, tabletlike works. 



1927 

Giacometti moves with Diego to a small studio on 
rue Hippolyte-Maindron, where he lives and works 
until his death. 

Spring Calder exhibits his toys in the Salon des 
Humonstes, Pans. 

Summer During a vacation in Cannes, Picasso exe- 
cutes an album of pen-and-ink drawings, The 
Metamorphoses, in which the bathers that have been 
a theme in his drawing for some time begin to take 
on a more monumental and sculptural quality. 
Although Picasso probably intended them as studies 
for his monument to Apollinaire, Christian Zervos 
writes in 1929 {Cahiers d'art) that Picasso proposed 
them as monuments to line the Croisette, the 
promenade in Cannes. 

August Following his return to New York, Calder 
goes to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to supervise the manu- 
facture of toys from his models. He continues to 
make wood sculpture. 

Fall Picasso paints Seated Woman (Z VII, 77), con- 
tinuing a series begun in 1925. He explores the 
double-head motif. 

Calder returns for a longer stay in Paris. He meets 
the Spanish sculptor Jose de Creeft, in whose studio 
he first sees forged-iron works by Gargallo. 
Winter Picasso begins his painting The Studio 
(1927-28; Z VII, 142), which from 1935 will be on 
view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 
Formally, it is closely related to contemporaneous 
drawings for wire sculptures. He also produces the 
first etchings for "The Unknown Masterpiece." 
As a full-time painting student at the Art Students 
League, Smith studies with John Sloan, and later 
with Jan Matulka, who introduce him to the work 
of Vasily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Picasso. 
Gonzalez produces his first iron sculptures. After 
years of self-doubt, he decides to concentrate on 
sculpture rather than decorative objects or painting. 
Five illustrations of Gargallo's metal sculptures are

published in Cahiers d'art (no. 2, E. Teriade, "Pablo 
Gargallo," pp. 283-86). 

A second edition of Apollinaire's The Poet 
Assassinated is published in Paris. 
December 27-February 28, 1928 Picasso has a 
solo exhibition at Galerie Pierre, Paris. 
1928 

January-February Picasso models the biomorphic 
figure Bather (Metamorphosis I) (WS 67) on his 
drawings from Cannes. It is his first three-dimen- 
sional sculpture since 1914. 

February-March Calder's first solo exhibition 
takes place at Weyhe Gallery, New York. He shows 
wire sculptures, such as Josephine Baker (1927). He 
also shows Romulus and Remus (1928), which is sub- 
sequently exhibited in the New York Salon des 
Independants at the Waldorf Hotel (on Thirty- 
fourth Street). 

March 20 Picasso makes preliminary ink drawings 
for his painted iron sculpture Head (1928; Z VII, 
140; MP 263). He perhaps contacts Gonzalez at this 
time to ask for his assistance in welding metal 
sculpture and, presumably, their collaboration 
begins that spring. This Head, completed in the fall, 
is directly related to Picasso's contemporary oil 
paintings, and particularly to the figures in The 
Studio (Z VII, 142) and Painter and Model (Z VII, 

143)- 

April 21-24, 26 Picasso produces drawings of a 
full standing figure with a head similar to that of 
the Head produced the previous month. (Josephine 
Withers, "The Artistic Collaboration of Pablo 
Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," in The Art journal 35 
[winter 1975-76], p. 109.) 

April 28 Picasso executes a drawing that antici- 
pates the composition of Woman in a Garden 
(1929-30). (WS, p. 74, footnote 83.) 
May 13 With the death ol his mother, Gonzalez 
writes to Picasso to tell him of his family's difficult 
situation (MP Archives). The collaboration between 



the two artists is temporarily interrupted. 
May 14 Picasso sends Gonzalez a note of condo- 
lence with a check for the work already completed 
(Estate of Julio Gonzalez, Paris). The note reads: "I 
have received your letter telling me of the sad news 
of the death of your mother. Believe me I am very 
sorry for you and your sisters, but for you whom I 
love, I am doubly sorry. I am not going to see you 
for fear of disturbing you. Concerning you, I send 
you a check since I don't have any ready cash" 
(reproduced in Josephine Withers, "The Artistic 
Collaboration of Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," 
p. 109, footnote 12). 

Summer Smith makes his first painting trips to 
Bolton Landing, New York. 

August While vacationing in Dinard, Brittany, 
Picasso makes over a dozen line drawings inspired 
by bathers at the beach (Sketchbook 1044, 
Collection, Marina Picasso; Werner Spies, 
Sammlung Marina Picasso, Munich, 1981, pp. 145- 
48, repr.). One of them, dated August 3, 1928, is a 
final sketch for his Construction, planned as a mon- 
ument to Apollinaire (Z VII, 206). 
October Picasso's Head (1928) is completed in 
Gonzalez's studio on rue de Medeah, Paris. Picasso 
also finishes the first of four metal-rod sculptures 
(Figure, also known as Construction in Wire or Wire 
Construction) which Kahnweiler later likens to 
"drawing in space" (Kahnweiler, The Sculptures of 
Picasso, London, 1949, p. 7). According to 
Josephine Withers, Gonzalez was paid by Picasso to 
execute these works (Withers, "The Artistic 
Collaboration of Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," 
p. 109). Initially, there may have been more than 
four sculptures (Brassa'f, Conversations avec Picasso, 
Paris, 1964, p. 25). Two of these works are submit- 
ted by Picasso as maquettes for the monument to 
Apollinaire, but they are turned down by the com- 
mittee. 
October-November Gonzalez exhibits four bronze

and published in Documents 4 (September 
1929) as an illustration to Michel Leins's arti- 
cle "Alberto Giacometti." 



repousse masks in the Salon d'Automne. 
November Calder returns to Paris, where he meets 
Giacometti, Miro, and Jules Pascin. 
Giacometti continues to develop the tabletlike 
sculptures and begins to make openwork structures 
(including Tlnee Figures Outdoors, Man and Woman, 
and Reclining Woman). He exhibits two tabletlike 
sculptures, Head and Personage, at Galerie Jeanne 
Bucher, Paris. "Eight days later they were sold and I 
had three contract proposals on my table," 
Giacometti said to Jean Clay (Yves Bonnefoy, 
Alberto Giacometti: A Biography of His Work, Paris, 
1991, p. 553). At the gallery he meets Andre 
Masson, who introduces him to Joan Miro, Georges 
Bataille, and poet Michel Leiris. This exhibition 
marks the beginning of his notoriety. 
1929 

January 25-February Calder's constructions in 
wire are exhibited at Galerie Billet, Pans. The cata- 
logue preface is written by Pascin. 
Spring Picasso continues to work in Gonzalez's 
studio; he begins work on Woman in a Garden, a 
larger-than-life-size figure originally proposed as a 
monument to Apolhnaire, which he assembles him- 
self (Spies, Sammlung Marina Picasso, p. 318). 
According to Gonzalez, it was preceded by a large 
number of studies (Gonzalez, "Picasso sculpteur et 
les cathedrales," in Josephine Withers, Julio 
Gonzalez: Sculpture in Iron, New York, 1978, p. 142, 
English translation p. 135). Gonzalez reports that it 
was made by Picasso "with so much love and ten- 
derness in the memory of his dear friend [that] at 
the moment he doesn't want to be separated from 
it" (Withers, "The Artistic Collaboration of Pablo 
Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," p. 112). Pictsso com- 
missions from Gonzalez a bronze replica of 
Picasso's Woman in a Garden after realizing that the 
iron original will rust if placed outdoors. 
Gonzalez produces his first experimental works, 
attempting to move away from his traditional train- 



ing in hammered metal and conventional ornamen- 
tal imagery (for example, Don Quixote). 
Calder exhibits at the Salon des Independants, Paris, 
and Galerie Neumann-Nierendorf, Berlin. 
June Calder returns to New York. He makes wire 
goldfish bowls with moving wire fish. 
Smith buys a property in Bolton Landing, on the 
western side of Lake George, New York, which 
becomes his base for the rest of his life. 
September Leiris publishes an article on 
Giacometti's sculpture in Documents ("Alberto 
Giacometti," no. 4, pp. 209-14). 
Fall Giacometti and Gonzalez are represented in 
the International Sculpture Show at Galerie Georges 
Bernheim, Paris. The exhibition is reviewed by 
Zervos in Cahiers d'art ("Notes sur la sculpture con- 
temporaine: A propos de la recente exposition inter- 
nationale de sculpture," no. 10, pp. 465-73), with a 
reproduction of Giacometti's Tlnee Figures Outdoors 
(1929)- 

Giacometti begins to develop his transparent or 
openwork constructions (Reclining Woman Who 
Dreams, 1929, and Standing Man) and makes his 
first "cage" sculpture (Suspended Ball). A Giacometti 
exhibition takes place at Galerie Pierre; work shown 
includes Reclining Woman Who Dreams and Three 
Figures Outdoors (1929). 

November Gonzalez exhibits his forged-iron 
sculptures for the first time at the Salon 
d'Automne. 

The Museum of Modern Art opens in New York. 
Cahiers d'art devotes an entire issue to "primitive" 
Oceanic art (nos. 2-3), and publishes a number of 
significant essays by Christian Zervos throughout 
the year: "Picasso a Dinard, Ete 1928" (no. 1) 
includes reproductions of Construction in Wire 
(October 1928; MP 266), p. 6, and Painted Iron 
Head (October 1928; MP 263), p. 11; "Les dernieres 
Oeuvres de Picasso" (no. 6) discusses the artist's 
paintings; and "Projet de Picasso pour un monu- 



263 



merit" (nos. 8-9) includes reproductions of Picasso's 
biomorphic, sculptural ink drawings for an imagi- 
nary monument of 1928, and one page of linear 
ink drawings related to his illustrations to "The 
Unknown Masterpiece" and to his wire construc- 
tions (Sketchbook 1044, Collection Marina 
Picasso). 
1930 

January 18-March 2 The Museum of Modern 
Art, New York, presents the exhibition Painting in 
Paris, its first to include work by Picasso. 
February Gonzalez exhibits his iron sculptures at 
Galerie de France, Paris. The catalogue preface is by 
Louis Vauxcelles, who also writes about Gonzalez in 
Carnet de la semaine introducing his work to the 
Paris art world. 

March Calder returns to Paris. 
Spring Gonzalez associates with the Gonstructivist 
group Cercle et Carre, organized by Torres-Garcia, 
as well as with Abstraction-Creation (although he 
never exhibits with either group). His association 
with both groups lasts until 1932. 
May Gonzalez and Picasso temporarily interrupt 
their collaboration as Gonzalez goes to Monthyon 
for the summer (letter dated May 25, 1930, MP 
Archives). 

November Accompanying the showing of the film 
L'Age d'or, by Luis Buriuel and Salvador Dali, an 
exhibition of works by Arp, Ernst, Miro, Man Ray, 
and other Surrealists is presented at Studio 28, 
Paris. Members of the Ligue des patriots (League of 
Patriots) and the Ligue antijuive (League Against 
Jews) assault the theater and gallery. 
November-December Picasso and Gonzalez work 
together at Gonzalez's studio on three assembled 
iron sculptures: Figurine or Figure of a Woman 
(1930), Head (1930), and Head of a Woman (1930- 
32). The first two pieces evolve from Picasso's draw- 
ings of 1928 (Sketchbook 1044, Collection, Marina 
Picasso; Werner Spies, Sammlung Marina Picasso, 



pp. 141-55, repr.). The frequency of their meetings 
is documented in letters from Gonzalez to Picasso 
dated between November 21 and December 30 (MP 
Archives). 

Fall Calder meets Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian, 
and Theo van Doesburg, and visits Mondrian's stu- 
dio in Paris, which impresses him deeply (see 
Myfanwy Evans, ed., The Painter's Object, London, 
x 937&gt; P- 63); soon after, he experiments briefly with 
abstract painting and creates his first abstract wire 
constructions. He also joins the Abstraction- 
Creation group. Calder's constructions in wire— por- 
traits and figures— are exhibited at the Salon des 
Surindependants, Paris. In December, he returns to 
the United States. 

Giacometti exhibits Suspended Ball at Galerie Pierre, 
together with works by Arp and Miro. Breton and 
Dali see Giacometti's sculpture and invite him to 
participate in Surrealist activities. 
Gonzalez produces The Kiss, Head, and Harlequin; 
these sculptures represent a point of departure. 
Paintings and Sculptures by Living Americans, at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New York, includes 
Calder's wood and wire sculptures. 
Smith, still a student at the Art Students League and 
in private classes with Jan Matulka, meets Stuart 
Davis, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, John 
Graham (who will introduce him to the sculpture 
of Gonzalez), and Jean Xceron. 
ca. 1930 Graham, a Russian-born painter, theo- 
rist, and connoisseur of "primitive" and Modern 
art, brings three sculptures by Gonzalez bought 
directly from the sculptor to New York, making 
them accessible to young artists like Smith. Two of 
these sculptures have been identified as Mask I (ca. 
1927-29) and Reclining Figure (ca. 1929). According 
to Smith, these were the first of Gonzalez's sculp- 
tures to arrive in the United States (Smith, 
"Gonzalez: First Master of the Torch," in Art News 
54, no. 10 [February 1956], pp. 34-37).

as "detail of a monument." 
1931 

Picasso continues to work with Gonzalez at the lat- 
ter's studio at rue de Medeah throughout the year 
(letters dated February 16 and 22, April 2, May 24, 
June 20, and October 20, MP Archives). Picasso 
incorporates real objects (colanders) into his sculp- 
ture Head of a Woman. 

Giacometti begins to make sculptures with movable 
parts, such as Hand Caught by a Finger and No 
More Play. 

April-May An exhibition of Calder's first abstract 
wood-and-wire constructions takes place at Galerie 
Percier, Paris. Entitled Volumes - Vecteurs - Densites - 
Dessins - Portraits, it includes works from the series 
Espaces, vecteurs, densites and the prototype for the 
motorized mobile Universe. At the insistence of the 
gallery director, the exhibition also includes wire 
portraits. The catalogue contains a foreword by 
Leger, entitled "Erik Satie Illustrated by Calder." 
May 25 After the show at Percier, Calder writes to 
his parents: "[The show] didn't sell anything, but it 
was a very handsome show, and was a real success 
among the artists. Of course, if we had sold a few 
things it would have been very much more exciting, 
but I am not disappointed. Things are very slow 
right now, and everybody said it was not the year to 
do it" (Margaret Calder Hayes, Three Alexander 
Calders: A Family Memoir, Middlebury, Vermont, 

1977- P- 259)- 

May An exhibition of Gonzalez's sculptures takes 

place at Galerie de France; Harlequin (1930) and 

Don Quixote (1930) are shown, among other works. 

An advertisement for the gallery in Cahiers d'art 

(nos. 5-6) illustrates Harlequin (captioned as Le 

Pierrot). 



May Picasso moves to the chateau de Boisgeloup 
in Normandy, having purchased the villa the previ- 
ous year. He converts a stable on the property into 
a sculpture studio, which enables him to produce 
very large work. 

May 30-June 10 An exhibition of seventeen 
sculptures by Gonzalez is held at Galerie Le 
Centaure, Brussels. The show includes Woman with 
a Basket, Woman with Amphora, Harlequin, The Kiss, 
Don Qinxote, and Reclining Mask, among others. The 
catalogue preface, written by Lucien Farnoux- 
Reynaud, stresses Gonzalez's Spanish quality and 
relates his work to that of Picasso: Ascetisme, specula- 
tion intellectuelle, voild les deux facteurs de Voeuvre de 
Gonzalez. Ne trouvons-nous pas ces deux facteurs a la 
base d'un autre artiste, Pablo Picasso? (Asceticism and 
intellectual analysis, these are the two factors in 
Gonzalez's work. Are these not the two factors we 
find at the foundation of another artist, Pablo 
Picasso?) 

May-June Giacometti exhibits at Galerie Pierre 
Loeb, Pans. 

July 1 Calder sends his parents a letter informing 
them of his recent membership in the Abstraction- 
Creation group: "I am now a member of the new 
group called 'Abstraction-Creation,' composed sole- 
ly of people who do abstractions— and who will 
show in the fall (November). They are also going to 
publish a journal" (Hayes, Three Alexander Calders: A 
Family Memoir, p. 260). 

October-November Calder's and Gonzalez's works 
are exhibited in the Salon des Surindependants. 
Gonzalez exhibits eight sculptures, fer forge (forged- 
iron sculptures). Most reviews of the exhibition sin- 
gle out Gonzalez and Calder. 

November Calder exhibits with the Abstraction- 
Creation group at the Porte de Versailles. He writes 
a statement for the catalogue that is also published 
in the magazine Abstraction -Creation. 
Fall Calder meets Marcel Duchamp, who encour- 



265 



ages him to experiment with motion in his sculp- 
ture and suggests the name "mobiles" for these 
objects with moving elements. 
Gonzalez produces Woman Combing Her Hair. 
Giacometti makes a series of sketches entitled 
Mobile and Mute Objects, which echo some of his 
sculptures of the same period, especially Cage 
(193 i ), Suspended Ball (1930-31), and Disagreeable 
Object (193 1). The drawings are reproduced in Le 
Surrealisme au service de la revolution (no. 3 
[December], pp. 16-17), "with text by Giacometti, 
and Dali's essay "Objets surrealistes" (Surrealist 
objects, in which he discusses Suspended Ball). Five 
works by Giacometti are also reproduced in Carl 
Einstein's Histoire de I'art du vingtieme siecle (2nd 
edition), published during this year. 
During a stay in the Virgin Islands, Smith makes 
his first tentative experiments in free-standing 
sculpture, utilizing found and carved coral forms. 
At the end of his period of collaboration with 
Picasso, Gonzalez writes the first draft of his essay 
"Picasso sculpteur et les cathedrales," which remains 
unpublished as a whole during his lifetime. (It is 
finally published in 1978, in Withers, Julio 
Gonzalez: Sculpture in Iron, pp. 13 1-45.) 
Honore de Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," 
illustrated by Picasso, is published by Ambroise 
Vollard in Paris. 

April Arranged by Duchamp, an exhibition of 
Calder's motor-driven "mobiles" takes place at 
Galerie Vignon, Paris. Calder also exhibits at the 
Association Artistique "1940." 

May Giacometti's first solo exhibition takes place 
at Galerie Pierre Colle, Paris. Picasso is one of the 
first to arrive at the vernissage. The exhibition 
includes the maquette of The Palace at 4 A.M., as 
well as other recent sculptures that are reproduced 
in Cahiers d'art as illustrations to an article by 
Zervos in which he defines Giacometti as "the only 



young sculptor whose work confirms and prolongs 
the new directions of sculpture" ("Quelques notes 
sur les sculptures de Giacometti," nos. 8-10, pp. 
337-42). The article includes reproductions of The 
Caress (In Spite oj the Hands) (1932), Courronou-u- 
animal (1932), Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932), 
Fall of a Body on a Diagram (1932), No More Play 
(1932), Project for a Square (1930-31), The Palace at 
4 A.M. (1932), and Disagreeable Relations (1932), all 
photographed by Man Ray. The Palace at 4 A.M. 
represents a culmination of Giacometti's "cage 
sculptures," hitherto consisting of single units. 
Calder returns to New York for five months. 
June Calder has an exhibition at Julien Levy 
Gallery, New York, which includes some of his 
motor-driven "mobiles." 

June 16-July 30 The first major retrospective of 
Picasso's work is held at Galeries Georges Petit, 
Paris. The selection is made by Picasso himself, and 
includes 236 works, ranging in date from 1901 to 
1932, with paintings, etchings, illustrated books, 
and seven sculptures (among them Woman's Head 
and Woman in a Garden). The catalogue essay is 
written by Charles Vrancken, and Zervos publishes 
a special issue of Cahiers d'art devoted to Picasso 
(vol. 7, nos. 3-5) to coincide with the exhibition 
(with 157 illustrations and texts by Apollinaire, 
Maud Dale, H. S. Ede, Carl Einstein, Ramon 
Gomez de la Serna, Gueguen, Will Grohmann, 
Georges Hugnet, Vicente Huidobro, Salmon, Oskar 
Schurer, Strawinsky, James Johnson Sweeney, 
Zervos, and others). The retrospective travels to the 
Kunsthaus Zurich, but is not well received. Carl 
Jung publishes an article psychoanalyzing Picasso's 
work in Neue Ziircher Zeitung (no. 13), "Picasso 
[psychoanalyzed]." (Partial translations of Jung's 
article appear in Cahiers d'art, nos. 8-10 [1932] and 
Revista de occidente 12, no. 131 [May 1934].)

months in the Virgin Islands, Smith experiments 
with abstract constructions, attaching coral, wood, 
and soldered lead and iron forms to a wooden base, 
although he continues to concentrate on painting. 
October Zervos publishes the first volume of his 
catalogue raisonne of Picasso's oeuvre (Paris). 
October-November Gonzalez exhibits three iron 
sculptures at the Salon des Sunndependants. 
November 26-December 30 A joint exhibition at 
Julien Levy Gallery, New York, shows etchings by 
Picasso with sculptures by American artist Joseph 
Cornell. 

December Photographer Brassai' goes to Picasso's 
studios at rue La Boetie, Pans, and Boisgeloup, 
Normandy, to photograph his sculptures for the 
magazine Minotaure. He describes them in his book 
Picasso and Company: 

I . . . photographed several sculptures in iron wire, 
done in the period 1930-31; linear, geometric con- 
structions in a three-dimensional space most of 
them triangular. In a way, they formed a sort of 
sculptural replica of his painted series on I'Atelier 
of 1927-28, the human form reduced to pure 
schema. On one of the mantels in Olga's apart- 
ment, next to a small bronze sculpture of the blue 
period, La Femme a Genoux, there was a strange 
wrought-iron piece, tall and skeletal, a sort of scare- 
crow wearing a fur cap and topped with a little fig- 
ure of Punch; a long, pointed iron foot, of a type 
still used by bootmakers, formed its base. Picasso 
had laden his "Christmas Tree" with all kinds of 
souvenirs. . . . Just beside the "tree" there was a pot 
from which emerged the tormented roots of a 
philodendron whose stalk, shorn of all its leaves, 
carried a ram's horn and a red plume at its summit. 
But the majority of Picasso's sculptures were at 
Boisgeloup. ... [In Boisgeloup] Picasso insisted on 
leading us across the park to the edge of the woods, 
where he had set up two of his wrought-iron stat- 



ues—one was called Le Cerf (Woman in a Garden). 
They dated from the preceding year. . . . Picasso had 
watched with curiosity as his friend Julio Gonzalez, 
an expert metalworker, hammered and twisted the 
incandescent metal, and then he had asked him to 
initiate him into the mysteries of iron and fire 
(Brassai, Picasso and Company, London, 1966, 
pp. 15 ff). 

Calder begins a series of wind-powered "mobiles" 
with the standing mobile Calderberry Bush. 
Smith sees reproductions of welded sculptures by 
Picasso and Gonzalez in Cahiers d'art. This discov- 
ery deeply affects him: "First iron sculptures I made 
[in 1933] prompted by seeing the work of Picasso 
which I have been told were created jointly with 
Gonzalez (See 1932 Cahiers d'Art [sic.]). Constructed 
Sculptures. . . . When I saw the liberation made by 
Picasso in the work, I was told Gonzalez had helped 
him" (David Smith, brief autobiographical text 
reproduced in David Smith by David Smith, ed. 
Cleve Gray, London, 1968, p. 24). 
Abstraction-Creation , Art non figuratif 1932, no. 1 
(p. 6), includes a statement by Calder, "Comment 
realiser l'art?" (How does art come into being?). 
Further illustrations of Calder's work appear in 
nos. 2 and 3. 
1933 

January Calder visits Madrid and Barcelona, 
exhibiting in the Sociedad de Cursos y 
Conferencias, Residencia de Estudiantes of the 
University of Madrid and in Amies de l'Art Nou 
and Galenes Syra, Barcelona. 

February-March Picasso produces a series of fan- 
tastic sculptural studies of bathers, a suite of pencil 
drawings entitled An Anatomy. 
March-May Picasso explores the theme of the 
sculptor's studio, beginning a series of forty etch- 
ings that he would finish the following year with a 
further six. 



267 



April 12 Gonzalez and Giacometti participate in 
the Cahiers d'art Auction. Gonzalez's Harlequin 
(1930) is illustrated in the accompanying issue of 
the magazine (nos. 1-2). Other sculptors participat- 
ing in the event include Laurens and Lipchitz. 
May 15 Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution, 
no. 5, publishes Giacometti's "Poeme en 7 espaces," 
"Le Rideau brun," "Charbon d'herbe," and "Hier, 
Sables mouvants." 

Spring Calder is included in a group exhibition at 
Galerie Pierre, along with Arp, Jean Helion, Miro, 
Antoine Pevsner, and Kurt Seligmann, and has a 
show at Galerie Pierre Colle. In June he returns to 
the United States. 

June Breton publishes his article "Picasso dans son 
element" (Picasso in his element) in the first issue 
of Minotaure (June 1, pp. 46-47). He comments on 
Picasso's new iron sculptures exhibited at Galenes 
Georges Petit in 1932, and stresses Picasso's liberty 
and lack of prejudice in his choice of iron and 
other materials for his sculpture: Si, comme on I'a 
vu, Picasso peintre n 'a pas de prejuge de la couleur, il 
faut bien s 'attendre a ce que Picasso sculpteur n 'ait pas 
le prejuge de la mature. (If, as we noticed, Picasso the 
painter has no prejudices about color, it is to be 
expected that Picasso the sculptor should have no 
prejudices about materials.) The article is illustrated 
with photographs by Brassai of Picasso's metal 
sculptures of this period, including the four ver- 
sions of Construction in Wire (1928; pp. 11 and 22), 
Painted Iron Head (1928; p. 11), Figure (1930; cap- 
tioned "Christmas Tree," p. 14), Woman in a 
Garden (1929-30; p. 20), Head of Woman (1930; 
between pp. 20 and 21), Figure (193 1; p. 22), and 
the series An Anatomy. 

Giacometti participates in a Surrealist exhibition at 
Galerie Pierre Colle, with Surrealist Table, a sculp- 
ture made especially for the occasion. 
August 12-25 Calder exhibits at the Berkshire 
Museum, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He writes a state- 



ment for the catalogue, discussing "the sense of 
motion in painting and sculpture." 
An exhibition of sculptures by Naum Gabo and 
Pevsner takes place at Galerie Percier. It concentrates 
on their abstract reliefs and constructions in plastic 
and metal. 

Fall Gonzalez exhibits at the Salon des 
Surindependants, showing six sculptures— two 
bronzes (a mask and The Kiss), two forged-iron 
works (Woman with a Bundle of Sticks and a mask), 
and two heads in stone. The Surrealist group also 
participates en masse. 

Conceived in part under the influence of Picasso's 
metal constructions reproduced in Cahiers d'art, to 
which he had access in Graham's library, and fol- 
lowing long discussions with Graham about 
Gonzalez's sculpture, Smith creates his first welded 
sculpture, Head with Cogs for Eyes. Also in 1933, he 
creates a small Reclining Figure in forged iron, which 
(according to Dorothy Dehner, Smith's first wife) 
was inspired by a sculpture by Gonzalez that had 
been in Graham's collection since the late 1920s or 
early '30s and is now in the Baltimore Museum of

End of the year Smith buys his first oxyacetylene 
welding torch and establishes his studio at the 
Terminal Iron Works, a machine shop on the 
Brooklyn waterfront, where he will continue to 
work for six years. (In 1950, he creates Blackburn, 
Song of an Irish Blacksmith, in honor of one of the 
owners of Terminal Iron Works.)

The catalogue for the collection of the Gallery of 
Living Art, A. E. Gallatin Collection, New York, 
includes a reproduction of Picasso's painting 
Dinard (1928). 

Anatole Jakovski's article "Alexander Calder" is

ern suburb ot Paris. 

1934 

Spring Alfred H. Barr, Jr. purchases a sculpture by 
Calder from the New York City Art Exposition, for 
the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New 
York. The work, entitled Mobile Construction 
Electrically Propelled, consists of "objects suspended 
in a vertical circle of wire" (as described by Calder 
in his Autobiography with Pictures, New York, 1966, 
p. 148). It is reproduced in E. M. Benson, "Seven 
Sculptors: Calder, Gargallo, Lehmbruck, Lipchitz, 
Manolo, Moore, Wolf," in The American Magazine 
of Art 28 (August 1935), pp. 454-69 (two works by 
Calder entitled Mobile Construction Electrically 
Propelled [1934] are illustrated, one captioned as the 
property of the Museum ot Modern Art). This piece 
was later exchanged tor a motorized "universe." 
April Calder's first exhibition at Pierre Matisse 
Gallery, New York, takes place. The catalogue pref- 
ace is written by Sweeney. 

April 25-May 8 Gonzalez exhibits at Galerie 
Percier. The catalogue preface is written by Raynal, 
who calls Gonzalez It plastiaen du vide (the sculptor 
of the void). The exhibition is possibly seen by 
Graham, who is probably the first American to col- 



lect the sculptor's work. Some ot the pieces includ- 
ed in the show, Head Called "The Fireman" (1933), 
Untitled, and Small Head with Triangle (1932-33), 
are illustrated in Cahiers d'art ("Exhibition Julio 
Gonzalez a la Galerie Percier," nos. 5-8, p. 209) and 
in Abstraction-Creation (no. 3). 

Summer Graham spends the summer at Bolton 
Landing with Smith, and gives him a mask by 
Gonzalez (Mask I, ca. 1927-29) and a portrait of 
himself by Calder. Gonzalez's mask is reproduced 
in David Smith, "Notes on My Work" (Arts 
Magazine 34, no. 5 [February i960], pp. 44-49), 
inscribed by David Smith. Graham shows Smith 
two other masks by Gonzalez from his own collec- 
tion. 

October 11-December 4 Gonzalez and 
Giacometti are chosen for the exhibition Was ist 
Surrealismus (What is Surrealism?) at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich. The exhibition also includes works by Arp, 
Ernst, and Miro. Gonzalez's entries are Kiss (Lovers) 
(i9?o), Dream (1934), Don Quixote (1930), and a 
mask. 

November 20-30 An exhibition ot Gonzalez's 
sculptures at Galerie Cahiers d'art, Paris, is orga- 
nized by Yvonne Zervos. Some of the works exhibit- 
ed are illustrated in Cahiers d'art (nos. 1-4, 1935), 
accompanying his "Reponse a l'enquete sur l'art 
actuel," including Woman Combing Her Hair (ca. 
193 1 ), The Lovers (1932-33), Woman with Mirror 
(ca. 1934), and Dancer with the Palette (ca. 1934). 
Sweeney visits the exhibition (letter dated November 
9, 1936, in Gonzalez Estate, Paris). 
Smith sees Gargallo's welded sculptures at the 
Brummer Gallery, New York (also reproduced in 
Cahiers d'art 7, nos. 8-10). 

Smith takes a position as Technical Supervisor of 
Mural Painting in the Treasury Relief Art Project, a 
New Deal art program, and shows some of his Head 
series at a group show at Julien Levy Gallery in the 
spring.

Giacometti returns to figurative sculpture with 
works such as Walking Nude, 1 + 1 = 3, an ^ The 
Invisible Object, as well as a series of skull-like heads. 
Breton writes "Equations de l'objet trouve," reprint- 
ed in L 'Amour fou, in which he describes his experi- 
ence of The Invisible Object. 

December i-January 1, 1935 Giacometti's first 
solo exhibition in New York, Abstract Sculptures by 
Alberto Giacometti, is held at Julien Levy Gallery. 
Overshadowed by an exhibition of Dali's work in 
the same gallery, none of the sculptures sell, and the 
reviews are scarce and mostly negative. Smith visits 
the show. 

Abstraction-Creation, Art non figuratif 1934 (no. 3, 
pp. 9 and 16) reproduces Calder's Mobile and 
Gonzalez's Small Head with Triangle (1932-34). 

I93S

tion of a plaster head by Giacometti. 
February-March Giacometti and Gonzalez are rep- 
resented in the exhibition These, Antithese, et Synthese 
(Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis) at the

bronze, The Kiss, in iron, and Dance, in iron. 
Giacometti's Fragment of a Sculpture is reproduced 
in the catalogue. 

Galerie Pierre, Paris, exhibits a group of Picasso's 
1912-14 collages. 

August Albert E. Gallatin, American painter and 
collector, buys two works by Gonzalez for his 
Gallery of Living Art, open to the public in New 
York since 1927. These works are a silver sculpture, 
Resplendence (Standing Figure) (1932) and an untitled 
sketch of 1934 for a sculpture (letters from Gallatin 
dating from August 16, 1935, and August 24, 1935; 
Estate of Julio Gonzalez, Paris). 
ca. 1935 Gallatin purchases Giacometti's Sculpture 
(1927, carved plaster) for the Gallery of Living Art. 
It is reproduced in the museum's 1936 catalogue. 



September The American Magazine of Art 28 
(pp. 539-47 and 572) includes an essay by Dorothy 
Dudley, "Four Postmoderns [A. Alicka, Benno, 
F. Bores, and J. Gonzalez]," and reproductions of 
works by Gonzalez: Woman Combing Her Hair (ca. 
193 1) and The Dream (1934). 

Fall Smith leaves New York for an extended trip to 
Europe. In Paris, Graham introduces him to artists 
and guides him to museums and private collections. 
Graham takes Smith to Gonzalez's studio in Paris, 
but the Spaniard has already moved to Arcueil. 
Smith never meets Gonzalez. 

Calder designs his first outdoor "mobile" for the 
garden of Mrs. Charlotte Allen in Rochester, New 
York. 

Giacometti begins to make sculptures from nature 
again, working from both life and his imagination 
henceforth. He is officially expelled from the 
Surrealist group, and his friendships with Balthus, 
Francis Gruber, and Pierre Tal Coat begin. 
November 20-30 Gonzalez exhibits iron sculp- 
tures at Galenes Cahiers d'art, Paris.

September 21 Julio Gonzalez is born in 
Barcelona, Spain. 
1881 

October 25 Pablo Picasso is born in Malaga, 
Spain. 
1898 

July 22 Alexander Calder is born in Philadelphia. 
ca. 1897-99 

Julio Gonzalez and his older brother Joan frequent 
the Barcelona cafe Els Quatre Gats. Other artists 
who attend include painters Ramon Casas, Picasso, 
Santiago Rusinol, and Joaquin Torres-Garcia and 
sculptor Manolo Hugue, among others. 
1899 

Julio and Joan Gonzalez move to Paris, where they 
maintain their friendship with Picasso. Julio 
Gonzalez and Picasso devote themselves chiefly to 
painting. Gonzalez later meets Picasso's friends 
Francisco [Paco] Durrio and Pablo Gargallo, who 
are metal sculptors, as well as Max Jacob, Andre 
Salmon, and Maurice Raynal. Gonzalez also comes 
to know Constantin Brancusi. 
1 90 1 

October 10 Alberto Giacometti is born in 
Borgonovo, Gnsons, Switzerland. 
Picasso shares Gonzalez's living quarters in Paris 
while he looks for a studio. 
1902 

Summer Gonzalez and Picasso meet in Barcelona 
and Picasso draws Gonzalez's portrait. 
1903 

Picasso goes back to Barcelona again in January and 
stays there until spring of 1904. 
1904 

Spring Picasso returns to Paris. In Montmartre, he 
moves into a studio building, which becomes 
known as the Bateau-Lavoir. 

August 23 In a letter to Picasso, Julio Gonzalez 
responds to a quarrel that has occurred between 



Joan and Picasso. The relationship between Picasso 
and Gonzalez is disrupted for a number of years 
following this incident (letter from Gonzalez to 
Picasso, MP Archives). 

Fall Picasso meets Salmon and, some months later, 
befriends Guillaume Apollinaire. Along with Jacob, 
they become Picasso's closest friends and the first 
defenders of Cubism, later to be joined by Pierre 
Reverdy. 
1906 

Picasso becomes familiar with pre-Roman Iberian 
sculpture at the Louvre (in an exhibition of recently 
excavated sculpture from Osuna and Cerro de los 
Santos). His paintings soon reflect their robust pro- 
portions and archaic features. 

March 9 David Smith is born in Decatur, Indiana. 
Spring Picasso meets Henri Matisse, and then 
Andre Deram. 
1907 

Picasso begins painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 
April-May. In May or June he discovers historic 
African sculpture at the Musee ethnographique du 
Trocadero. Unknown to Picasso, African sculpture 
is already being collected by Derain, Maurice de 
Vlaminck, and Matisse. He finishes Demoiselles in 
early July. Picasso meets dealer Daniel-Henry 
Kahnweiler that summer. Picasso and Georges 
Braque are introduced by Apollinaire in October or 
November. 

March-April Gonzalez exhibits paintings, includ- 
ing Mother and Child, in the Salon des 
Independants, Paris. 
1908 

Gonzalez is deeply affected by the death of his 
brother Joan. Experiencing a profound crisis, he 
isolates himself and ceases to work: "He abandoned 
his work for many months, refused to see his 
friends. He quarreled with Picasso" (Roberta 
Gonzalez, "Julio Gonzalez, My Father," in Arts 30, 
no. 5, p. 22). 



257 



Picasso and Braque form a closer relationship. 
When Braque shows his landscapes at Galerie 
Kahnweiler, Paris, critics speak of "cubes" and the 
term "cubism" is coined. 
1909 

Gonzalez exhibits paintings at the Salon d'Automne 
and Salon de la Nationale, Paris. 
Summer Picasso travels to Barcelona, and to Horta 
de Ebro for the second time, where he paints land- 
scapes and portraits that mark the beginning of 
Analytic Cubism. He also starts experimenting with 
sculpture. 

September or October Picasso moves into a stu- 
dio and apartment at 11, boulevard de Clichy, 
where he lives with Fernande Olivier. 
Fall Picasso models his Head of a Woman, a 
sculpted portrait of Olivier closely related to his 
drawings and paintings in the Analytic Cubist style, 
in Gonzalez's studio in Paris. Of this work, Picasso 
said: "I thought the curves you see on the surface 
should continue in the interior. I had the idea of 
doing them in wire, (but) it was too intellectual, too 
much like painting" (quoted in Roland Penrose, The 
Sculpture of Picasso, New York, 1967, p. 19). 
1910 

Making a tentative return to sculpture following his 
crisis over the loss of his brother, Gonzalez pro- 
duces his first masks in metal repousse, an assem- 
blage of pieces of cut sheet metal. (He had received 
his training in metalwork from his father, a sculp- 
tor and goldsmith.) 

Picasso has a solo exhibition at Galerie Notre- 
Dame-des-Champs, Paris, and is included in a 
group show at Grafton Galleries, London. He and 
Braque are represented in group shows in 
Diisseldorf and Munich. 
191 1 

March 28-April 25 Pablo Picasso: An Exhibition of 
Early and Recent Drawings and Watercolors is held at 
the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (later 



renamed Gallery 291), New York. Selected by 
Edward Steichen, Mario de Zayas (author of the cat- 
alogue preface), and Frank Burty Havilland, this is 
the first exhibition of Picasso's work in the United 
States. Alfred Stieglitz, owner of the gallery, acquires 
the drawing Nude Woman of 19 10 (Z II, 208) from 
the show. 

Summer Picasso and Braque work in close collabo- 
ration in Ceret, in the French Pyrenees. 
1912 

Picasso takes part in the second exhibition of Der 
blaue Reiter at Galerie Goltz, Munich, and later 
exhibits at the Berliner Sezession. Spends the sum- 
mer with Braque in Sorgues, in the south of France. 
He moves with Eva Gouel from Montmartre to the 
Montparnasse area of Paris, and produces his first 
construction, Guitar, and first collage, Still Life with 
Chair Caning. Signs a three-year contract with 
Kahnweiler. 
1913 

Gonzalez takes a studio at 1, rue Leclerc, which he 
uses until 1920. 

February-March Picasso has eight works in the 
International Exhibition of Modern Art (the Armory 
Show) in New York. By spring, he is developing his 
Synthetic Cubist style. 

November Gonzalez participates in the Salon 
d'Automne, Paris, exhibiting one painting and one 
metal work. 

Apollinaire publishes Les Peintres cubistes: Meditations 
esthetiaues in Paris, becoming the champion of 
Cubism and very much involved with avant-garde 
art. 
1914 

August World War I begins. Apollinaire, Braque, 
and Derain are conscripted. Picasso, in Avignon at 
the time, remains there until the fall, when he 
returns to Paris. 

Fall Gonzalez exhibits a bronze mask at the Salon 
d'Automne, and is appointed "societaire," allowing

Apollinaire returns from the front, and Picasso 
draws several portraits of his friend, who has recent- 
ly become a French citizen. 

Summer Picasso moves from Montparnasse to 
Montrouge, a neighborhood directly south just out- 
side the city limits. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is 
shown publicly for the first time in Art moderne en 
France at the Salon d'Antin. 

Apollinaire publishes The Poet Assassinated, written 
between 1910 and 191 5, in Paris. Its main charac- 
ter, the poet Croniamantal, may be interpreted as 
Apollinaire, and one of his best friends, "the Benin 
bird," as Picasso. When Croniamantal is assassinat- 
ed, the Benin bird has the idea of making a statue. 
Picasso and his friends organize a dinner party to 
celebrate the publication on December 31. 
1917 

Picasso goes to Rome for two months and works on 
his sets and costumes for the ballet Parade. While 
there, he meets and falls in love with Olga Koklova, 
a dancer in the Ballets Russes. The ballet debuts in 
Paris in May, to a negative response. 
1918 

June 10-September 26 Gonzalez works at La 
Soudure autogene francaise metalworks in the 
Renault plant at Boulogne-sur-Seine, where he 
learns oxyacetylene welding. He executes his first 
known work in iron by this method, "a little statue 
of Christ, forged in secret at the factory by this 
process" (Roberta Gonzalez, "Julio Gonzalez, My 
Father," p. 23). 
July Picasso marries Koklova. 



November 9 Picasso is deeply affected by the 
death of Apollinaire from Spanish influenza. Serge 
Ferat and other friends of Apollinaire decide to 
commission Picasso to create a monument to the 
dead poet. 

Mid-November Picasso and Koklova move to 23, 
rue La Boetie, on Paris's Right Bank. 
November 1 1: World War I ends. 
1919 

Calder graduates as a mechanical engineer from the 
Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New 
Jersey. From this year to 1922, he takes various 
apprentice engineering ]obs. 

Picasso designs sets and costumes in London for the 
Ballets Russes performance of Tricorne, which opens 
in July. He works in both a Cubist and realist man- 
ner, and exhibits at Paul Rosenberg Gallery, Paris. 
1920 

January-May Picasso designs the sets and costumes 
for the Ballets Russes's Pulcinella, which opens in 
Paris on May 1 5. 

November Gonzalez takes a metalworking studio 
at 18, rue d'Odessa. He exhibits in the Salle cata- 
lane at the Salon d'Automne, submitting three 
paintings, a silver sculpture titled Seated Woman (ca. 
1 91 8), two repousse masks in bronze and silver, and 
jewelry. He also exhibits works at the Salon 
d'Automne and the Salon de la Nationale. 
1921 

April Gonzalez exhibits paintings and two 
repousse bronzes at the Salon des Independants. 
The first monograph on Picasso's work, by Maurice 
Raynal, is published in Munich. 
May Picasso receives the official commission for 
his monument to Apollinaire, and a committee is 
created to raise financial support for the project. 
However, one of its members, the director of Le 
Mercure de Prance, asks s'il n'y avait pas des gens trop 
bizarres dans le comite, des meteques, des cubistes, des 
bolchevistes, des dadaistes et autres sortes de Boches (that 



259 



there not be anyone too bizarre on the committee- 
foreigners, Cubists, Bolsheviks, Dadaists, and other 
sorts of Germans) (Christa Lichtenstern, Picasso, 
Monument a Apollinaire: Projet pour une bumanisation 
de Fespace, Paris, 1990, p. 14). 

Summer Picasso paints Three Women at the Spring 
and Three Musicians in classical and Cubist modes, 
respectively. 

October-November Gonzalez exhibits four paint- 
ings, four forged bronzes, one forged silver, and 
one sculpture (Eve, 1900-10) at the Salon 
d'Automne. One of the forged bronzes, Mask of 
Woman, is bought by the State for 1,000 francs. 
Picasso and Gonzalez reestablish contact around 
this time. 
1922 

January 1 Giacometti arrives in Paris and enters 
the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere, where he 
studies for three years in Antoine Bourdelle's class. 
Collector Jacques Doucet buys Picasso's Demoiselles 
for 25,000 francs. 

March Gonzalez's first solo exhibition takes place 
at the Galerie Povolovsky, Paris. It includes paint- 
ings, watercolors, drawings, sculpture, and jewelry, 
and is mentioned in Art News (May 25, in a review 
signed "M. C"). The catalogue preface is by 
Alexandre Mercereau, a lifelong supporter and 
friend of Gonzalez. 

May Gonzalez exhibits two portraits in bronze 
repousse (Roger and Jean de Neyreis, both 1912-14) 
in the Salon de la Nationale, Paris. His work is 
mentioned by Gustave Kahn in he Mercure (May 

15). 

Calder begins to attend evening drawing classes at a 
public school on East Forty-second Street, New 
York, under Clinton Balmer. 
1923 

January 1-15 An exhibition of Gonzalez's jewelry, 
objets d'art, repousse bronzes, paintings, and sculp- 
tures is held at Galerie du Cameleon. 



Fall Calder enters the Art Students League, New 
York, where he will study until 1926. He works first 
under Kenneth Hayes Miller, and later with George 
Luks, Boardman Robinson, and John Sloan. 
Gonzalez exhibits in the Salon d'Automne, showing 
two paintings and an iron medallion commissioned 
by the Musee Pasteur. He also shows work in the 
Salon de la Nationale. 

November In New York, Paul Rosenberg/ 
Wildenstein Gallery exhibits sixteen recent works by 
Picasso. 
1924 

Picasso makes a large, painted metal construction, 
Guitar, and paints a series of monumental Synthetic 
Cubist still lifes. 

Summer In Juan-les-Pins, Picasso produces a 
sketchbook of ink dot-and-line drawings reminis- 
cent of constellations. 

October Andre Breton publishes his Manijeste du 
surrealisme (Surrealist manifesto) (Paris: Editions 
Sagitaire). 

Gonzalez moves his metalworking studio to 11, rue 
de Medeah, where he works until January 1935. 
1925 

January 1 5 Two pages of Picasso's sketchbook of 
the previous summer are reproduced in La 
Revolution surrealiste (no. 2, pp. 16-17). 
Summer Smith works as a riveter on a frame 
assembly line in the Studebaker plant at South 
Bend, Indiana. This experience prepares him for his 
future production of iron sculpture, and gives him 
"a feeling for industrial forms, training in the han- 
dling of tools and factory equipment, and a sense of 
identification with working men" (Garnett McCoy, 
ed., David Smith, New York, 1973, p. 18). 
July 1 5 Picasso's Demoiselles is reproduced in La 
Revolution surrealiste. 

Giacometti ceases to use models and works instead 
from his imagination, a practice that he follows 
almost exclusively for ten years. The first works he

produces using this method (Torso, The Couple, 
1926, and Spoon Woman, 1926) show the influence 
of Cubism, especially as practiced by Henri Laurens 
and Jacques Lipchitz, as well as of African and 
Cycladic art. He sets up an atelier in Paris with his 
brother Diego, and participates for the first time in 
the Salon des Tuileries, where he shows a sculpture. 
Caider makes drawings for the book Animal 
Sketching, which is published the following year. 
November Together with Jean Arp, Giorgio de 
Chirico, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Man Ray, Joan 
Miro, and others, Picasso takes part in the first 
Surrealist painting exhibition, La Peinture surrealistc, 
at Galerie Pierre, Paris. 

ca. 1925 Caider makes his first wire sculptures. 
1926 

January Christian Zervos publishes the first issue 
of Cahiers d'art. 

Gonzalez exhibits at the Salon des Independants, 
submitting, among other works, two repousse 
bronzes of 191 3. 

Commissioned by Ambroise Vollard to illustrate 
Honore de Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," 
Picasso translates his dot-and-hne drawings from 
the summer of 1924 into woodcuts. 
May 16 A text attributed to Picasso is published in 
Moscow, in the magazine Ogonek. There is a direct 
relationship between its descriptive content and the 
dot-and-line drawings of 1924. 
Caider exhibits paintings at The Artist Gallery, New 
York. He begins wood carving. 

June Caider arrives in Paris and enters the 
Academie de la Grande Chaumiere. He begins his 
Circus and makes his first animated toys. 
ca. December After a year spent working in 
Washington, D.C., and taking poetry courses at 
George Washington University, Smith moves to 
New York and begins to attend classes at the Art 
Students League. 
Giacometti begins a series of thin, tabletlike works. 



1927 

Giacometti moves with Diego to a small studio on 
rue Hippolyte-Maindron, where he lives and works 
until his death. 

Spring Caider exhibits his toys in the Salon des 
Humoristes, Paris. 

Summer During a vacation in Cannes, Picasso exe- 
cutes an album of pen-and-ink drawings, The 
Metamorphoses, in which the bathers that have been 
a theme in his drawing for some time begin to take 
on a more monumental and sculptural quality. 
Although Picasso probably intended them as studies 
for his monument to Apollinaire, Christian Zervos 
writes in 1929 (Cahiers d'art) that Picasso proposed 
them as monuments to line the Croisette, the 
promenade in Cannes. 

August Following his return to New York, Caider 
goes to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to supervise the manu- 
facture of toys from his models. He continues to 
make wood sculpture. 

Fall Picasso paints Seated Woman (Z VII, 77), con- 
tinuing a series begun in 1925. He explores the 
double-head motif. 

Caider returns for a longer stay in Paris. He meets 
the Spanish sculptor Jose de Creeft, in whose studio 
he first sees forged-iron works by Gargallo. 
Winter Picasso begins his painting The Studio 
(1927-28; Z VII, 142), which from 1935 will be on 
view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 
Formally, it is closely related to contemporaneous 
drawings for wire sculptures. He also produces the 
first etchings for "The Unknown Masterpiece." 
As a full-time painting student at the Art Students 
League, Smith studies with John Sloan, and later 
with Jan Matulka, who introduce him to the work 
of Vasily Kandinsky, Piet Mondnan, and Picasso. 
Gonzalez produces his first iron sculptures. After 
years of self-doubt, he decides to concentrate on 
sculpture rather than decorative objects or painting. 
Five illustrations of Gargallo's metal sculptures are 



261 



published in Cahiers d'art (no. 2, E. Teriade, "Pablo 
Gargallo," pp. 283-86). 

A second edition of Apollinaire's The Poet 
Assassinated is published in Paris. 
December 27-February 28, 192.8 Picasso has a 
solo exhibition at Galerie Pierre, Paris. 
1928 

January-February Picasso models the biomorphic 
figure Bather (Metamorphosis I) (WS 67) on his 
drawings from Cannes. It is his first three-dimen- 
sional sculpture since 1914. 

February-March Calder's first solo exhibition 
takes place at Weyhe Gallery, New York. He shows 
wire sculptures, such ^Josephine Baker (1927). He 
also shows Romulus and Remus (1928), which is sub- 
sequently exhibited in the New York Salon des 
Independants at the Waldorf Hotel (on Thirty- 
fourth Street). 

March 20 Picasso makes preliminary ink drawings 
for his painted iron sculpture Head (1928; Z VII, 
140; MP 263). He perhaps contacts Gonzalez at this 
time to ask for his assistance in welding metal 
sculpture and, presumably, their collaboration 
begins that spring. This Head, completed in the fall, 
is directly related to Picasso's contemporary oil 
paintings, and particularly to the figures in The 
Studio (Z VII, 142) and Painter and Model (Z VII, 

143)- 

April 21-24, 2 ^ Picasso produces drawings of a 
full standing figure with a head similar to that of 
the Head produced the previous month. (Josephine 
Withers, "The Artistic Collaboration of Pablo 
Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," in The Art Journal 35 
[winter 1975-76], p. 109.) 

April 28 Picasso executes a drawing that antici- 
pates the composition of Woman in a Garden 
(1929-30). (WS, p. 74, footnote 83.) 
May 13 With the death of his mother, Gonzalez 
writes to Picasso to tell him of his family's difficult 
situation (MP Archives). The collaboration between 



the two artists is temporarily interrupted. 
May 14 Picasso sends Gonzalez a note of condo- 
lence with a check for the work already completed 
(Estate of Julio Gonzalez, Paris). The note reads: "I 
have received your letter telling me of the sad news 
of the death of your mother. Believe me I am very 
sorry for you and your sisters, but for you whom I 
love, I am doubly sorry. I am not going to see you 
for fear of disturbing you. Concerning you, I send 
you a check since I don't have any ready cash" 
(reproduced in Josephine Withers, "The Artistic 
Collaboration of Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," 
p. 109, footnote 12). 

Summer Smith makes his first painting trips to 
Bolton Landing, New York. 

August While vacationing in Dinard, Brittany, 
Picasso makes over a dozen line drawings inspired 
by bathers at the beach (Sketchbook 1044, 
Collection, Marina Picasso; Werner Spies, 
Sammlung Marina Picasso, Munich, 1981, pp. 145- 
48, repr.). One of them, dated August 3, 1928, is a 
final sketch for his Construction, planned as a mon- 
ument to Apollinaire (Z VII, 206). 
October Picasso's Head (1928) is completed in 
Gonzalez's studio on rue de Medeah, Paris. Picasso 
also finishes the first of four metal-rod sculptures 
(Figure, also known as Construction in Wire or Wire 
Construction) which Kahnweiler later likens to 
"drawing in space" (Kahnweiler, The Sculptures of 
Picasso, London, 1949, p. 7). According to 
Josephine Withers, Gonzalez was paid by Picasso to 
execute these works (Withers, "The Artistic 
Collaboration of Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," 
p. 109). Initially, there may have been more than 
four sculptures (Brassa'i, Conversations avec Picasso, 
Paris, 1964, p. 25). Two of these works are submit- 
ted by Picasso as maquettes for the monument to 
Apollinaire, but they are turned down by the com- 
mittee. 
October-November Gonzalez exhibits four bronze

and published in Documents 4 (September 
ip2p) as an illustration to Michel Leiris's arti- 
cle "Alberto Giacometti." 



repousse masks in the Salon d'Automne. 
November Calder returns to Paris, where he meets 
Giacometti, Miro, and Jules Pascin. 
Giacometti continues to develop the tabletlike 
sculptures and begins to make openwork structures 
(including Three Figures Outdoors, Man and Woman, 
and Reclining Woman). He exhibits two tabletlike 
sculptures, Head and Personage, at Galerie Jeanne 
Bucher, Paris. "Eight days later they were sold and I 
had three contract proposals on my table," 
Giacometti said to Jean Clay (Yves Bonnefoy, 
Alberto Giacometti: A Biography of His Work, Paris, 
1991, p. 553). At the gallery he meets Andre 
Masson, who introduces him to Joan Miro, Georges 
Bataille, and poet Michel Leiris. This exhibition 
marks the beginning of his notoriety. 
1929 

January 25-February Calder's constructions in 
wire are exhibited at Galerie Billet, Paris. The cata- 
logue preface is written by Pascin. 
Spring Picasso continues to work in Gonzalez's 
studio; he begins work on Woman in a Garden, a 
larger-than-life-size figure originally proposed as a 
monument to Apollinaire, which he assembles him- 
self (Spies, Sammlung Marina Picasso, p. 318). 
According to Gonzalez, it was preceded by a large 
number of studies (Gonzalez, "Picasso sculpteur et 
les cathedrales," in Josephine Withers, Julio 
Gonzalez: Sculpture in Iron, New York, 1978, p. 142, 
English translation p. 135). Gonzalez reports that it 
was made by Picasso "with so much love and ten- 
derness in the memory of his dear friend [that] at 
the moment he doesn t want to be separated from 
it" (Withers, "The Artistic Collaboration of Pablo 
Picasso and Julio Gonzalez," p. 112). Picasso com- 
missions from Gonzalez a bronze replica of 
Picasso's Woman in a Garden after realizing that the 
iron original will rust if placed outdoors. 
Gonzalez produces his first experimental works, 
attempting to move away from his traditional train- 



ing in hammered metal and conventional ornamen- 
tal imagery (for example, Don Quixote). 
Calder exhibits at the Salon des Independants, Paris, 
and Galerie Neumann-Nierendorf, Berlin. 
June Calder returns to New York. He makes wire 
goldfish bowls with moving wire fish. 
Smith buys a property in Bolton Landing, on the 
western side of Lake George, New York, which 
becomes his base for the rest of his life. 
September Leiris publishes an article on 
Giacometti's sculpture in Documents ("Alberto 
Giacometti," no. 4, pp. 209-14). 
Fall Giacometti and Gonzalez are represented in 
the International Sculpture Show at Galerie Georges 
Bernheim, Paris. The exhibition is reviewed by 
Zervos in Cahiers d'art ("Notes sur la sculpture con- 
temporaine: A propos de la recente exposition inter- 
national de sculpture," no. 10, pp. 465-73), with a 
reproduction of Giacometti's Three Figures Outdoors 

(1929)- 

Giacometti begins to develop his transparent or 
openwork constructions (Reclining Woman Who 
Dreams, 1929, and Standing Man) and makes his 
first "cage" sculpture (Suspended Ball). A Giacometti 
exhibition takes place at Galerie Pierre; work shown 
includes Reclining Woman Who Dreams and Three 
Figures Outdoors (1929). 

November Gonzalez exhibits his forged-iron 
sculptures for the first time at the Salon 
d'Automne. 

The Museum of Modern Art opens in New York. 
Cahiers d'art devotes an entire issue to "primitive" 
Oceanic art (nos. 2-3), and publishes a number of 
significant essays by Christian Zervos throughout 
the year: "Picasso a Dinard, Ete 1928" (no. 1) 
includes reproductions of Construction in Wire 
(October 1928; MP 266), p. 6, and Painted Iron 
Head (October 1928; MP 263), p. 1 1; "Les dernieres 
Oeuvres de Picasso" (no. 6) discusses the artist's 
paintings; and "Projet de Picasso pour un monu- 



263 



merit" (nos. 8-9) includes reproductions of Picasso's 
biomorphic, sculptural ink drawings for an imagi- 
nary monument of 1928, and one page of linear 
ink drawings related to his illustrations to "The 
Unknown Masterpiece" and to his wire construc- 
tions (Sketchbook 1044, Collection Marina 
Picasso). 
1930 

January 18-March 2 The Museum of Modern 
Art, New York, presents the exhibition Painting in 
Paris, its first to include work by Picasso. 
February Gonzalez exhibits his iron sculptures at 
Galerie de France, Paris. The catalogue preface is by 
Louis Vauxcelles, who also writes about Gonzalez in 
Carnet de la semaine introducing his work to the 
Paris art world. 

March Calder returns to Paris. 
Spring Gonzalez associates with the Gonstructivist 
group Cercle et Carre, organized by Torres-Garcia, 
as well as with Abstraction-Creation (although he 
never exhibits with either group). His association 
with both groups lasts until 1932. 
May Gonzalez and Picasso temporarily interrupt 
their collaboration as Gonzalez goes to Monthyon 
for the summer (letter dated May 25, 1930, MP 
Archives). 

November Accompanying the showing of the film 
LAge d'or, by Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, an 
exhibition of works by Arp, Ernst, Miro, Man Ray, 
and other Surrealists is presented at Studio 28, 
Paris. Members of the Ligue des patriots (League of 
Patriots) and the Ligue antijuive (League Against 
Jews) assault the theater and gallery. 
November-December Picasso and Gonzalez work 
together at Gonzalez's studio on three assembled 
iron sculptures: Figurine or Figure of a Woman 
(1930), Head (1930), and Head of a Woman (1930- 
32). The first two pieces evolve from Picasso's draw- 
ings of 1928 (Sketchbook 1044, Collection, Marina 
Picasso; Werner Spies, Sammlung Marina Picasso, 



pp. 141-55, repr.). The frequency of their meetings 
is documented in letters from Gonzalez to Picasso 
dated between November 21 and December 30 (MP 
Archives). 

Fall Calder meets Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian, 
and Theo van Doesburg, and visits Mondrian's stu- 
dio in Paris, which impresses him deeply (see 
Myfanwy Evans, ed., The Painter's Object, London, 
1937, p. 63); soon after, he experiments briefly with 
abstract painting and creates his first abstract wire 
constructions. He also joins the Abstraction- 
Creation group. Calder's constructions in wire— por- 
traits and figures— are exhibited at the Salon des 
Surindependants, Paris. In December, he returns to 
the United States. 

Giacometti exhibits Suspended Ball at Galerie Pierre, 
together with works by Arp and Miro. Breton and 
Dali see Giacometti's sculpture and invite him to 
participate in Surrealist activities. 
Gonzalez produces The Kiss, Head, and Harlequin; 
these sculptures represent a point of departure. 
Paintings and Sculptures by Living Americans, at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New York, includes 
Calder's wood and wire sculptures. 
Smith, still a student at the Art Students League and 
in private classes with Jan Matulka, meets Stuart 
Davis, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, John 
Graham (who will introduce him to the sculpture 
of Gonzalez), and Jean Xceron. 
ca. 1930 Graham, a Russian-born painter, theo- 
rist, and connoisseur of "primitive" and Modern 
art, brings three sculptures by Gonzalez bought 
directly from the sculptor to New York, making 
them accessible to young artists like Smith. Two of 
these sculptures have been identified as Mask I (ca. 
1927-29) and Reclining Figure (ca. 1929). According 
to Smith, these were the first of Gonzalez's sculp- 
tures to arrive in the United States (Smith, 
"Gonzalez: First Master of the Torch," in Art News 
54, no. 10 [February 1956], pp. 34-37).

Picasso's Head (1930) is reproduced for the first 
time in Eugenio D'Ors, Picasso (Paris, 1930, pi. 48), 
as "detail of a monument." 
1931 

Picasso continues to work with Gonzalez at the lat- 
ter's studio at rue de Medeah throughout the year 
(letters dated February 16 and 22, April 2, May 24, 
June 20, and October 20, MP Archives). Picasso 
incorporates real objects (colanders) into his sculp- 
ture Head of a Woman. 

Giacometti begins to make sculptures with movable 
parts, such as Hand Caught by a Finger and No 
More Play. 

April-May An exhibition of Calder's first abstract 
wood-and-wire constructions takes place at Galerie 
Percier, Paris. Entitled Volumes - Vecteurs - Densttes - 
Dessins - Portraits, it includes works from the series 
Espaces, vecteurs, densites and the prototype for the 
motorized mobile Universe. At the insistence of the 
gallery director, the exhibition also includes wire 
portraits. The catalogue contains a foreword by 
Leger, entitled "Erik Satie Illustrated by Calder." 
May 25 After the show at Percier, Calder writes to 
his parents: "[The show] didn't sell anything, but it 
was a very handsome show, and was a real success 
among the artists. Of course, if we had sold a few 
things it would have been very much more exciting, 
but I am not disappointed. Things are very slow 
right now, and everybody said it was not the year to 
do it" (Margaret Calder Hayes, Three Alexander 
Calders: A Family Aiemoir, Middlebury, Vermont, 
1977, p. 259). 

May An exhibition of Gonzalez's sculptures takes 
place at Galerie de France; Harlequin (1930) and 
Don Quixote (1930) are shown, among other works. 
An advertisement for the gallery in Cahiers d'art 
(nos. 5-6) illustrates Harlequin (captioned as Le 
Pierrot). 



May Picasso moves to the chateau de Boisgeloup 
in Normandy, having purchased the villa the previ- 
ous year. He converts a stable on the property into 
a sculpture studio, which enables him to produce 
very large work. 

May 30-June 10 An exhibition of seventeen 
sculptures by Gonzalez is held at Galerie Le 
Centaure, Brussels. The show includes Woman with 
a Basket, Woman with Amphora, Harlequin, The Kiss, 
Don Quixote, and Reclining Mask, among others. The 
catalogue preface, written by Lucien Farnoux- 
Reynaud, stresses Gonzalez's Spanish quality and 
relates his work to that of Picasso: Ascetisme, specula- 
tion intellectuelle, voild les deux facteurs de Foeuvre de 
Gonzalez. Ne trouvons-nous pas ces deux facteurs a la 
base d'un autre artiste, Pablo Picasso? (Asceticism and 
intellectual analysis, these are the two factors in 
Gonzalez's work. Are these not the two factors we 
find at the foundation of another artist, Pablo 
Picasso?) 

May-June Giacometti exhibits at Galerie Pierre 
Loeb, Paris. 

July 1 Calder sends his parents a letter informing 
them of his recent membership in the Abstraction- 
Creation group: "I am now a member of the new 
group called 'Abstraction-Creation,' composed sole- 
ly of people who do abstractions— and who will 
show in the fall (November). They are also going to 
publish a journal" (Hayes, Three Alexander Calders: A 
Family Memoir, p. 260). 

October-November Calder's and Gonzalez's works 
are exhibited in the Salon des Surindependants. 
Gonzalez exhibits eight sculptures, fer forge (forged- 
iron sculptures). Most reviews of the exhibition sin- 
gle out Gonzalez and Calder. 

November Calder exhibits with the Abstraction- 
Creation group at the Porte de Versailles. He writes 
a statement for the catalogue that is also published 
in the magazine Abstraction-Creation. 
Fall Calder meets Marcel Duchamp, who encour- 



265 



ages him to experiment with motion in his sculp- 
ture and suggests the name "mobiles" for these 
objects with moving elements. 
Gonzalez produces Woman Combing Her Hair. 
Giacometti makes a series of sketches entitled 
Mobile and Mute Objects, which echo some of his 
sculptures of the same period, especially Cage 
(193 i ), Suspended Ball (1930-31), and Disagreeable 
Object (193 1). The drawings are reproduced in Le 
Surrealisme au service de la revolution (no. 3 
[December], pp. 16-17), w ' tn text by Giacometti, 
and Dah's essay "Objets surrealistes" (Surrealist 
objects, in which he discusses Suspended Ball). Five 
works by Giacometti are also reproduced in Carl 
Einstein's Histoire de I'art du vingtieme siecle (2nd 
edition), published during this year. 
During a stay in the Virgin Islands, Smith makes 
his first tentative experiments in free-standing 
sculpture, utilizing found and carved coral forms. 
At the end of his period of collaboration with 
Picasso, Gonzalez writes the first draft of his essay 
"Picasso sculpteur et les cathedrales," which remains 
unpublished as a whole during his lifetime. (It is 
finally published in 1978, in Withers, Julio 
Gonzalez: Sculpture in Iron, pp. 131-45.) 
Honore de Balzac's "The Unknown Masterpiece," 
illustrated by Picasso, is published by Ambroise 
Vollard in Paris. 
193:2. 

April Arranged by Duchamp, an exhibition of 
Calder's motor-driven "mobiles" takes place at 
Galerie Vignon, Paris. Calder also exhibits at the 
Association Artistique "1940." 

May Giacometti's first solo exhibition takes place 
at Galerie Pierre Colle, Paris. Picasso is one of the 
first to arrive at the vernissage. The exhibition 
includes the maquette of The Palace at 4 A.M., as 
well as other recent sculptures that are reproduced 
in Cabiers d'art as illustrations to an article by 
Zervos in which he defines Giacometti as "the only 



young sculptor whose work confirms and prolongs 
the new directions of sculpture" ("Quelques notes 
sur les sculptures de Giacometti," nos. 8-10, pp. 
337-42). The article includes reproductions of The 
Caress (In Spite of the Hands) (1932), Courronou-u- 
animal (1932), Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932), 
Fall of a Body on a Diagram (1932), No More Play 
(1932), Project for a Square (1930-31), The Palace at 
4 A.M. (1932), and Disagreeable Relations (1932), all 
photographed by Man Ray. The Palace at 4 A.M. 
represents a culmination of Giacometti's "cage 
sculptures," hitherto consisting of single units. 
Calder returns to New York for five months. 
June Calder has an exhibition at Julien Levy 
Gallery, New York, which includes some of his 
motor-driven "mobiles." 

June 16-July 30 The first major retrospective of 
Picasso's work is held at Galeries Georges Petit, 
Paris. The selection is made by Picasso himself, and 
includes 236 works, ranging in date from 1901 to 
1932, with paintings, etchings, illustrated books, 
and seven sculptures (among them Woman's Head 
and Woman in a Garden). The catalogue essay is 
written by Charles Vrancken, and Zervos publishes 
a special issue of Cahiers d'art devoted to Picasso 
(vol. 7, nos. 3-5) to coincide with the exhibition 
(with 157 illustrations and texts by Apollinaire, 
Maud Dale, H. S. Ede, Carl Einstein, Ramon 
Gomez de la Serna, Gueguen, Will Grohmann, 
Georges Hugnet, Vicente Huidobro, Salmon, Oskar 
Schiirer, Strawinsky, James Johnson Sweeney, 
Zervos, and others). The retrospective travels to the 
Kunsthaus Zurich, but is not well received. Carl 
Jung publishes an article psychoanalyzing Picasso's 
work in Neue Ziircher Zeitung (no. 13), "Picasso 
[psychoanalyzed]." (Partial translations of Jung's 
article appear in Cahiers d'art, nos. 8-10 [1932] and 
Revista de occidente 12, no. 13 1 [May 1934].)

months in the Virgin Islands, Smith experiments 
with abstract constructions, attaching coral, wood, 
and soldered lead and iron forms to a wooden base, 
although he continues to concentrate on painting. 
October Zervos publishes the first volume of his 
catalogue raisonne of Picasso's oeuvre (Pans). 
October-November Gonzalez exhibits three iron 
sculptures at the Salon des Surindependants. 
November 26-December 30 A joint exhibition at 
Julien Levy Gallery, New York, shows etchings by 
Picasso with sculptures by American artist Joseph 
Cornell. 

December Photographer Brassai' goes to Picasso's 
studios at rue La Boe'tie, Paris, and Boisgeloup, 
Normandy, to photograph his sculptures for the 
magazine Minotaure. He describes them in his book 
Picasso and Company: 

I . . . photographed several sculptures in iron wire, 
done in the period 1930-31; linear, geometric con- 
structions in a three-dimensional space most of 
them triangular. In a way, they formed a sort of 
sculptural replica of his painted series on l'Ateher 
of 1927-28, the human form reduced to pure 
schema. On one of the mantels in Olga's apart- 
ment, next to a small bronze sculpture of the blue 
period, La Femme a Genoux, there was a strange 
wrought-iron piece, tall and skeletal, a sort of scare- 
crow wearing a fur cap and topped with a little fig- 
ure of Punch; a long, pointed iron foot, of a type 
still used by bootmakers, formed its base. Picasso 
had laden his "Christmas Tree" with all kinds of 
souvenirs. . . . Just beside the "tree" there was a pot 
from which emerged the tormented roots of a 
philodendron whose stalk, shorn of all its leaves, 
carried a ram's horn and a red plume at its summit. 
But the majority of Picasso's sculptures were at 
Boisgeloup. ... [In Boisgeloup] Picasso insisted on 
leading us across the park to the edge of the woods, 
where he had set up two of his wrought-iron stat- 



ues—one was called Le Cerf (Woman in a Garden). 
They dated from the preceding year. . . . Picasso had 
watched with curiosity as his friend Julio Gonzalez, 
an expert metalworker, hammered and twisted the 
incandescent metal, and then he had asked him to 
initiate him into the mysteries of iron and fire 
(Brassai', Picasso and Company, London, 1966, 
pp. 15 ff). 

Calder begins a series of wind-powered "mobiles" 
with the standing mobile Calderberry Bush. 
Smith sees reproductions of welded sculptures by 
Picasso and Gonzalez in Cahiers d'art. This discov- 
ery deeply affects him: "First iron sculptures I made 
[in 1933] prompted by seeing the work of Picasso 
which I have been told were created jointly with 
Gonzalez (See 1932 Cahiers d'Art [sic.]). Constructed 
Sculptures. . . . When I saw the liberation made by 
Picasso in the work, I was told Gonzalez had helped 
him" (David Smith, brief autobiographical text 
reproduced in David Smith by David Smith, ed. 
Cleve Gray, London, 1968, p. 24). 
Abstraction-Creation , Art non figuratif 1932, no. 1 
(p. 6), includes a statement by Calder, "Comment 
realiser l'art?" (How does art come into being?). 
Further illustrations of Calder's work appear in 
nos. 2 and 3. 

1933 

January Calder visits Madrid and Barcelona, 
exhibiting in the Sociedad de Cursos y 
Conferencias, Residencia de Estudiantes of the 
University of Madrid and in Amies de l'Art Nou 
and Galenes Syra, Barcelona. 

February-March Picasso produces a series of fan- 
tastic sculptural studies of bathers, a suite of pencil 
drawings entitled An Anatomy. 
March-May Picasso explores the theme of the 
sculptor's studio, beginning a series of forty etch- 
ings that he would finish the following year with a 
further six. 



267 



April 12 Gonzalez and Giacometti participate in 
the Cahiers d'art Auction. Gonzalez's Harlequin 
(1930) is illustrated in the accompanying issue of 
the magazine (nos. 1-2). Other sculptors participat- 
ing in the event include Laurens and Lipchitz. 
May 1 5 Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution, 
no. 5, publishes Giacometti's "Poeme en 7 espaces," 
"Le Rideau bran," "Charbon d'herbe," and "Hier, 
Sables mouvants." 

Spring Calder is included in a group exhibition at 
Galerie Pierre, along with Arp, Jean Helion, Miro, 
Antoine Pevsner, and Kurt Seligmann, and has a 
show at Galerie Pierre Colle. In June he returns to 
the United States. 

June Breton publishes his article "Picasso dans son 
element" (Picasso in his element) in the first issue 
of Minotaure (June 1, pp. 46-47). He comments on 
Picasso's new iron sculptures exhibited at Galeries 
Georges Petit in 1932, and stresses Picasso's liberty 
and lack of prejudice in his choice of iron and 
other materials for his sculpture: Si, comme on I'a 
vu, Picasso peintre n 'a pas de prejuge de la couleur, il 
faut bien s'attendre a ce que Picasso sculpteur n'ait pas 
le prejuge de la matiere. (If, as we noticed, Picasso the 
painter has no prejudices about color, it is to be 
expected that Picasso the sculptor should have no 
prejudices about materials.) The article is illustrated 
with photographs by Brassai' of Picasso's metal 
sculptures of this period, including the four ver- 
sions of Construction in Wire (1928; pp. 11 and 22), 
Painted Iron Head (1928; p. 11), Figure (1930; cap- 
tioned "Christmas Tree," p. 14), Woman in a 
Garden (1929-30; p. 20), Head of Woman (1930; 
between pp. 20 and 21), Figure (193 1; p. 22), and 
the series An Anatomy. 

Giacometti participates in a Surrealist exhibition at 
Galerie Pierre Colle, with Surrealist Table, a sculp- 
ture made especially for the occasion. 
August 12-25 Calder exhibits at the Berkshire 
Museum, Piltsfield, Massachusetts. He writes a state- 



ment for the catalogue, discussing "the sense of 
motion in painting and sculpture." 
An exhibition of sculptures by Naum Gabo and 
Pevsner takes place at Galerie Percier. It concentrates 
on their abstract reliefs and constructions in plastic 
and metal. 

Fall Gonzalez exhibits at the Salon des 
Surindependants, showing six sculptures— two 
bronzes (a mask and The Kiss), two forged-iron 
works (Woman with a Bundle of Sticks and a mask), 
and two heads in stone. The Surrealist group also 
participates en masse. 

Conceived in part under the influence of Picasso's 
metal constructions reproduced in Cahiers d'art, to 
which he had access in Graham's library, and fol- 
lowing long discussions with Graham about 
Gonzalez's sculpture, Smith creates his first welded 
sculpture, Head with Cogs for Eyes. Also in 1933, he 
creates a small Reclining Figure in forged iron, which 
(according to Dorothy Dehner, Smith's first wife) 
was inspired by a sculpture by Gonzalez that had 
been in Graham's collection since the late 1920s or 
early '30s and is now in the Baltimore Museum of 
Art (Gift of Elinor Graham). 

End of the year Smith buys his first oxyacetylene 
welding torch and establishes his studio at the 
Terminal Iron Works, a machine shop on the 
Brooklyn waterfront, where he will continue to 
work for six years. (In 1950, he creates Blackburn, 
Song of an Irish Blacksmith, in honor of one of the 
owners of Terminal Iron Works.) 
December Giacometti's "Notes on Palace at 
4A.M" is published in Minotaure (nos. 3-4, pp. 46- 
47), with illustrations of The Palace at 4 A.M. (1932- 
33), Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932), and Flower 
in Danger (1933). A second text by Giacometti is 
published in the same issue (p. 109), a response to 
the question formulated by Breton and Paul Eluard,

The catalogue for the collection of the Gallery of 
Living Art, A. E. Gallatin Collection, New York, 
includes a reproduction of Picasso's painting 
Dinard (1928). 

Anatole Jakovski's article "Alexander Calder" is

ern suburb of Paris. 

1934 

Spring Alfred H. Barr, Jr. purchases a sculpture by 
Calder from the New York City Art Exposition, for 
the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New 
York. The work, entitled Mobile Construction 
Electrically Propelled, consists of "objects suspended 
in a vertical circle of wire" (as described by Calder 
in his Autobiography with Pictures, New York, 1966, 
p. 148). It is reproduced in E. M. Benson, "Seven 
Sculptors: Calder, Gargallo, Lehmbruck, Lipchitz, 
Manolo, Moore, Wolf," in ~D)e American Magazine 
of Art 28 (August 1935), pp. 454-69 (two works by 
Calder entitled Mobile Construction Electrically 
Propelled [1934] are illustrated, one captioned as the 
property of the Museum of Modern Art). This piece 
was later exchanged for a motorized "universe." 
April Calder's first exhibition at Pierre Matisse 
Gallery, New York, takes place. The catalogue pref- 
ace is written by Sweeney. 

April 25-May 8 Gonzalez exhibits at Galerie 
Percier. The catalogue preface is written by Raynal, 
who calls Gonzalez le plasticien du vide (the sculptor 
of the void). The exhibition is possibly seen by 
Graham, who is probably the first American to col- 



lect the sculptor's work. Some of the pieces includ- 
ed in the show, Head Called "The Fireman" (1933), 
Untitled, and Small Head with Triangle (1932-33), 
are illustrated in Cahiers d'art ("Exhibition Julio 
Gonzalez a la Galerie Percier," nos. 5-8, p. 209) and 
in Abstraction-Creation (no. 3). 

Summer Graham spends the summer at Bolton 
Landing with Smith, and gives him a mask by 
Gonzalez (Mask I, ca. 1927-29) and a portrait of 
himself by Calder. Gonzalez's mask is reproduced 
in David Smith, "Notes on My Work" (Arts 
Magazine 34, no. 5 [February i960], pp. 44-49), 
inscribed by David Smith. Graham shows Smith 
two other masks by Gonzalez from his own collec- 
tion. 

October 11-December 4 Gonzalez and 
Giacometti are chosen for the exhibition Was ist 
Surrealismus (What is Surrealism?) at the Kunsthaus 
Zurich. The exhibition also includes works by Arp, 
Ernst, and Miro. Gonzalez's entries are Kiss (Lovers) 
(1930), Dream (1934), Don Quixote (1930), and a 
mask. 

November 20-30 An exhibition of Gonzalez's 
sculptures at Galerie Cahiers d'art, Pans, is orga- 
nized by Yvonne Zervos. Some of the works exhibit- 
ed are illustrated in Cahiers d'art (nos. 1-4, 1935), 
accompanying his "Reponse a l'enquete sur l'art 
actuel," including Woman Combing Her Hair (ca. 
193 1 ), The Lovers (1932-33), Woman with Mirror 
(ca. 1934), and Dancer with the Palette (ca. 1934). 
Sweeney visits the exhibition (letter dated November 
9, 1936, in Gonzalez Estate, Paris). 
Smith sees Gargallo's welded sculptures at the 
Brummer Gallery, New York (also reproduced in 
Cahiers d'art 7, nos. 8-10). 

Smith takes a position as Technical Supervisor of 
Mural Painting in the Treasury Relief Art Project, a 
New Deal art program, and shows some of his Head 
series at a group show at Julien Levy Gallery in the 
spring.

Giacometti returns to figurative sculpture with 
works such as Walking Nude, 1 + 1 = 3, ar *d The 
Invisible Object, as well as a series of skull-like heads. 
Breton writes "Equations de 1'objet trouve," reprint- 
ed in L'Amour fou, in which he describes his experi- 
ence of The Invisible Object. 

December i-January 1, 1935 Giacometti's first 
solo exhibition in New York, Abstract Sculptures by 
Alberto Giacometti, is held at Julien Levy Gallery. 
Overshadowed by an exhibition of Dalfs work in 
the same gallery, none of the sculptures sell, and the 
reviews are scarce and mostly negative. Smith visits 
the show. 

Abstraction-Creation , Art non figuratif 1934 (no. 3, 
pp. 9 and 16) reproduces Calder's Mobile and 
Gonzalez's Small Head with Triangle (1932-34). 

1935 

Cabiers d'art (nos. 1-4, p. 19) includes an illustra- 
tion of a plaster head by Giacometti. 
February-March Giacometti and Gonzalez are rep- 
resented in the exhibition These, Antitbese, et Synthese 
(Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis) at the 
Kunstmuseum in Lucerne. Gonzalez's entries are

bronze, The Kiss, in iron, and Dance, in iron. 
Giacometti's Fragment of a Sculpture is reproduced 
in the catalogue. 

Galerie Pierre, Paris, exhibits a group of Picasso's 
1 91 2- 14 collages. 

August Albert E. Gallatin, American painter and 
collector, buys two works by Gonzalez for his 
Gallery of Living Art, open to the public in New 
York since 1927. These works are a silver sculpture, 
Resplendence (Standing Figure) (1932) and an untitled 
sketch of 1934 for a sculpture (letters from Gallatin 
dating from August 16, 1935, and August 24, 1935; 
Estate of Julio Gonzalez, Paris). 
ca. 193s Gallatin purchases Giacometti's Sculpture 
(1927, carved plaster) for the Gallery of Living Art. 
It is reproduced in the museum's 1936 catalogue. 



September The American Magazine of Art 28 
(pp. 539-47 and 572) includes an essay by Dorothy 
Dudley, "Four Postmoderns [A. Ahcka, Benno, 
F. Bores, and J. Gonzalez]," and reproductions of 
works by Gonzalez: Woman Combing Her Hair (ca. 
193 1) and The Dream (1934). 

Fall Smith leaves New York for an extended trip to 
Europe. In Paris, Graham introduces him to artists 
and guides him to museums and private collections. 
Graham takes Smith to Gonzalez's studio in Paris, 
but the Spaniard has already moved to Arcueil. 
Smith never meets Gonzalez. 

Calder designs his first outdoor "mobile" for the 
garden of Mrs. Charlotte Allen in Rochester, New 
York. 

Giacometti begins to make sculptures from nature 
again, working from both life and his imagination 
henceforth. He is officially expelled from the 
Surrealist group, and his friendships with Balthus, 
Francis Gruber, and Pierre Tal Coat begin. 
November 20-30 Gonzalez exhibits iron sculp- 
tures at Galenes Cahiers d'art, Paris. 
1936 

January Cahiers d'art devotes a special issue to 
Picasso's art from 1930 to 1935 (Picasso 1930-1935,

acceleration, energy, etc.— lines which form significant angles and 
directions, making up one, or several, totalities. 

Spaces and volumes, created by the slightest opposition to their 
mass, or penetrated by vectors, traversed by momentum. 

None of this is fixed. Each element can move, shift, or sway 
back and forth in a changing relation to each of the other elements 
in this universe. 

Thus they reveal not only isolated moments, but a physical law 
of variation among the events of life. 

Not extractions, but abstractions: 

Abstractions which resemble no living thing, except by their 
manner of reacting.

Arno Press, 1970, pp. 62-6 j. First edition, London: Curwen Press, 

1937- 

When an artist explains what he is doing he usually has to do one 
of two things: either scrap what he has explained, or make his sub- 
sequent work fit in with the explanation. Theories may be all very 
well for the artist himself, but they shouldn't be broadcast to other 
people. All that I shall say here will be about what I have already 
done, not about what I am going to do. 

I began by studying engineering. But after four years I decided 
that engineering did not allow enough play of ingenuity on my 
part. When I was working in a logging camp I first started painting. 
I went to New York, and then to Pans, where I started making wire 
toys— caricatures of people and animals, some of them articulated. 
Then I made things in wood, taking a lump of wood and making 
very little alteration in its shape— just enough to turn it into some- 
thing different. Then I made a circus with elephants, horses, a lion, 
Roman chariots and so on: basically of wire, but with cork and 
wood and bright colours added. Most of these objects also were 
articulated, so that they made characteristic gestures. The material 
for this was based on my observation at the circus, and on drawings 
of it. I was always interested in circuses. 

My father was a sculptor and my mother a painter, but it was 
quite accidentally that I became mixed up with modern art. 
Through a neighbour who knew about modern art— he had read the 
books, and so on— I went to see Mondrian. I was very much moved 



by Mondrian's studio, large, beautiful and irregular in shape as it 
was, with the walls painted white and divided by black lines and 
rectangles of bright colour, like his paintings. It was very lovely, 
with a cross-light (there were windows on both sides), and I thought 
at the time how fine it would be if everything there moved; though 
Mondrian himself did not approve of this idea at all. I went home 
and tried to paint. But wire, or something to twist, or tear, or bend, 
is an easier medium for me to think in. I started with a few simple 
forms. My first show was at the Galene Percier, of simple things 
ranged on a plank against a wall. In a way, some of those things 
were as plastic as anything I have done. They did not move, but 
they had plastic qualities. Then I made one or two things that 
moved in a slight degree. I had the idea of making one or two 
obiects at a time find actual relationships in space. 

I did a setting for Satie's Socrate in Hertford, U.S.A., which I 
will describe, as it serves as an indication of a good deal of my sub- 
sequent work. 

There is no dancing in it. It is sung by two people— a man and 
a woman. The singing is the main thing in it. The proscenium 
opening was 12 feet by 30 feet. There were three elements in the set- 
ting. As seen from the audience, there was a red disc about 30 inch- 
es across, left centre. Near the left edge there was a vertical rectan- 
gle, 3 feet by 10 feet, standing on the floor. Towards the right, there 
were two 7 foot steel hoops at right angles on a horizontal spindle, 
with a hook one end and a pulley the other, so that it could be 
rotated in either direction, and raised and lowered. The whole dia- 
logue was divided into three parts: 9, 9, and 18 minutes long. 
During the first part the red disc moved continuously to the 
extreme right, then to the extreme left (on cords) and then returned 
to its original position, the whole operation taking 9 minutes. In 
the second section there was a minute at the beginning with no 
movement at all, then the steel hoops started to rotate toward the 
audience, and after about three more minutes they were lowered 
towards the floor. Then they stopped, and started to rotate again in 
the opposite direction. Then in the original direction. Then they 
moved upwards again. That completed the second section. In the 
third, the vertical white rectangle tilted gently over to the right until 
it rested on the ground, on its long edge. Then there was a pause. 
Then it fell over slowly away from the audience, face on the floor. 
Then it came up again with the other face towards the audience; 



289 



and that face was black. Then it rose into a vertical position again, 
still black, and moved away towards the right. Then, just at the end, 
the red disc moved off to the left. The whole thing was very gentle, 
and subservient to the music and the words. 

For a couple of years in Paris I had a small ballet-object, built 
on a table with pulleys at the top of a frame. It was possible to 
move coloured discs across the rectangle, or fluttering pennants, or 
cones; to make them dance, or even have battles between them. 
Some of them had large, simple, majestic movements; others were 
small and agitated. I tried it also in the open air, swung between 
trees on ropes, and later Martha Graham and I projected a ballet on 
these lines. For me, increase in size— working full-scale in this way- 
is very interesting. I once saw a movie made in a marble quarry, and 
the delicacy of movement of the great masses of marble, imposed of 
necessity by their great weight, was very handsome. My idea with 
the mechanical ballet was to do it independently of dancers, or 
without them altogether, and I devised a graphic method of regis- 
tering the ballet movements, with the trajectories marked with dif- 
ferent coloured chalks or crayons. 

I have made a number of things for the open air: all of them 
react to the wind, and are like a sailing vessel in that they react best 
to one kind of breeze. It is impossible to make a thing work with 
every kind of wind. I also used to drive some of my mobiles with 
small electric motors, and though I have abandoned this to some 
extent now, I still like the idea, because you can produce a positive 
instead of a fitful movement— though on occasions I like that too. 
With a mechanical drive, you can control the thing like choreogra- 
phy in a ballet and superimpose various movements: a great num- 
ber, even, by means of cams and other mechanical devices. To com- 
bine one or two simple movements with different periods, however, 
really gives the finest effect, because while simple, they are capable 
of infinite combinations. 

From "What Abstract Art Means to Me: Statements By Six 

American Artists," in The Museum of Modern Art Bulletin 18, 

no. } (spring 1951), pp. 8-9. 
My entrance into the field of abstract art came about as the result 
of a visit to the studio of Piet Mondrian in Paris in 1930. 

I was particularly impressed by some rectangles of color he had 
tacked on his wall in a pattern after his nature. 



I told him I would like to make them oscillate— he objected. I 
went home and tried to paint abstractly— but in two weeks I was 
back again among plastic materials. 

I think that at that time and practically ever since, the underly- 
ing sense of form in my work has been the system of the Universe, 
or part thereof. For that is a rather large model to work from. 

What I mean is that the idea of detached bodies floating in 
space, of different sizes and densities, perhaps of different colors 
and temperatures, and surrounded and interlarded with wisps of 
gaseous condition, and some at rest, while others move in peculiar 
manners, seems to me the ideal source of form. 

I would have them deployed, some nearer together and some at 
immense distances. 

And great disparity among all the qualities of these bodies, and 
their motions as well. 

A very exciting moment for me was at the planetarium— when 
the machine was run fast for the purpose of explaining its opera- 
tion: a planet moved along a straight line, then suddenly made a 
complete loop of 360 off to one side, and then went off in a 
straight line in its original direction. 

I have chiefly limited myself to the use of black and white as 
being the most disparate colors. Red is the color most opposed to 
both of these— and then, finally, the other primaries. The secondary 
colors and intermediate shades serve only to confuse and muddle 
the distinctness and clarity. 

When I have used spheres and discs, I have intended that they 
should represent more than what they just are. More or less as the 
earth is a sphere, but also has some miles of gas about it, volcanoes 
upon it, and the moon making circles around it, and as the sun is a 
sphere— but also is a source of intense heat, the effect of which is 
felt at great distances. A ball of wood or a disc of metal is rather a 
dull object without this sense of something emanating from it. 

When I use two circles of wire intersecting at right angles, this 
to me is a sphere— and when I use two or more sheets of metal cut 
into shapes and mounted at angles to each other, I feel that there is 
a solid form, perhaps concave, perhaps convex, filling in the dihe- 
dral angles between them. I do not have a definite idea of what this 
would be like, I merely sense it and occupy, myself with the shapes 
one actually sees. 

Then there is the idea of an object floating— not supported— the 



290 



use of a very long thread, or a long arm in cantilever as a means of 
support seems to best approximate this freedom from the earth. 

Thus what I produce is not precisely what I have in mind— but 
a sort of sketch, a man-made approximation. 

That others grasp what I have in mind seems unessential, at 
least as long as they have something else in theirs.

Notes on "Palace at 4 A.M." 

From Minotaure, nos. 3-4 (Dec. 19}}), p. 46. English excerpt from 
The Museum of Modern Art, Alberto Giacometti (exh. cat.), with 
introduction by Peter Selz. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 

1965, p- 44- 
I can only speak indirectly about my sculptures and can only hope 
to partially describe what motivated them. 

For years now I have created only sculptures that presented 
themselves to my mind fully formed. I have limited myself to 
reproducing them in space without changing anything, without ask- 
ing myself what they might mean (if I even attempt to alter part of 
one or try to figure out its significance, I am completely lost and 
the object ruined.) Nothing has ever appeared to me in the form of 
a painting; rarely do I see in the form of a drawing. The occasional 
attempts I have made at the conscious realization of a painting or 
even a sculpture have always failed. 

Once the object is made I have a tendency to find in it, trans- 
formed and displaced, images, impressions, and events that have 
moved me deeply (often without my knowing it), shapes that I 
sense to be close to me, although I am often incapable of identify- 
ing them, which makes them all the more disturbing to me. 

I use the sculpture reproduced here, which represents a palace, 
as an example. " This object took shape little by little in the late 
summer of 1932; it revealed itself to me slowly, the various parts 
taking their exact form and their precise place within the whole. By 
autumn it had attained such reality that its actual execution in 
space took no more than one day. 

It is related without any doubt to a period in my life that had 
come to an end a year before, when for six whole months hour 
after hour was passed in the company of a woman who, concentrat- 
ing all life in herself, magically transformed my every moment. We 



used to construct a fantastic palace at night— days and nights had 
the same color, as if everything happened just before daybreak; 
throughout the whole time I never saw the sun— a very fragile palace 
of matchsticks. At the slightest false move a whole section of this 
tiny construction would collapse. We would always begin it over 
again. I don't know why it came to be inhabited by a spinal column 
in a cage— the spinal column this woman sold me one of the very 
first nights I met her on the street— and by one of the skeleton birds 
that she saw the very night before the morning in which our life 
together collapsed— the skeleton birds that flutter with cries of joy at 
four o'clock in the morning very high above the pool of clear, 
green water where the extremely fine, white skeletons of fish float in 
the great unroofed hall. 

In the middle there rises the scaffolding of a tower, perhaps 
unfinished or, since its top has collapsed, perhaps also broken. 

On the other side there appeared the statue of a woman, in 
which I recognize my mother, just as she appears in my earliest 
memories. The mystery of her long black dress touching the floor 
troubled me; it seemed to me like a part of her body, and aroused 
in me a feeling of fear and confusion. All the rest has vanished, and 
escaped my attention. This figure stands out against the curtain that 
is repeated three times, the very curtain I saw when I opened my 
eyes for the first time. In search of an infinite enchantment I fixed 
my gaze upon this brown curtain, above which a thin thread of 
light filtered across the floor. 

I can't say anything about the red object in front of the board; I 
identify it with myself.

extent did it or does it seem to you that this meeting was the result of 

chance or of necessity?), in Minotaure, nos. 3-4 (Dec. 193 3), p. 109. 

A white string in a puddle of cold liquid pitch haunts me, but at 

the same time, one October night in 1930, I see pass before me the 

gait and the profile— a small part of the profile, the concave line 

between forehead and nose— of a woman, who from that moment 



291 



on unfolds like a continuous line through each space in the rooms 
where I have been. This encounter gave me and gives me still, in 
spite of the surprise and the shock, an impression of necessity. It 
seems to me that every encounter that has ever affected me has 
taken place in daytime, at the precise moment it had to.

Space . . . 

Words cannot express the perceptions of the eye and hand. Words 
distort thoughts, writings distort words: they become unrecognize- 
able. I do not believe in spatial problems; space is created by 
objects; a mobile which turns with no point of its surface touching 
the surface of another object has no sensation of space. It's the sub- 
ject that counts. Space, form, canvas, plaster, bronze ... so many 
means. The important thing is to re-create an object that can pro- 
duce the closest sensation to the sensation felt at the sight of the 
subject . . . 

Sculpture is built on empty space. It is the space one makes in 
the process of constructing an object, and, in turn, the object cre- 
ates a space. It is the very space between the subject and the sculp- 
tor.

I certainly make paintings and sculpture and, ever since I first 
painted or drew, it has always been to bite into reality, to defend 
myself, to nourish myself, to get bigger; to get bigger the better to 
defend myself, the better to be able to attack, to capture, to make as 
much progress as possible on every front, in all directions, to pro- 
tect myself from hunger, cold, death, to be as free as possible; as 
free as possible to try— with the means most suitable to me today— 
to see better, to understand better the things around me, to under- 
stand better to be more free, as big as possible, in order to spend, to

David Smith 

Letter, in French, to Roberta Gonzalez, written from Bolton 

Landing, N.Y. [n.d., prior to Nov. 4, ipssj- Solomon R. 

Guggenheim Museum Archives, New York. 
Madame, 

For its forthcoming December issue the magazine Art News has 
asked me to write an article on your father, Julio Gonzalez. I have 
admired his work since 1932 when I was a student and saw a repro- 
duction of his sculpture for the first time. 

In 1934, my friend John Graham (a Russian-American painter 
and collector) gave me a small head that he had bought from your 
father. It is an early mask in iron, smaller than a hand, with 
"strings" across the brow forming the lines of the features. I am 
going to have it photographed and will send you a copy. 

In 1936 John Graham and I met in Paris and wanted to visit 
your father, but he had moved. I had just returned from Greece, 
and was on my way to the Soviet Union; I went home without pass- 
ing through Paris again. To my great regret I never met him; other- 
wise I would not have to trouble you for this article. 

The painter Herman Cherry lent me the information you sent 
him regarding the dates of your father's work, and I own the cata- 
logue "Amsterdam-Bruxelles." I have a few translated notes, but I 
would like to ask you a few questions about the personal and inti- 
mate things that artists talk about, which are always very different 
from official museum reports. 

I wish to speak of the artist Gonzalez and write as if I were con- 
versing with other artists. 

I come to you with profound respect and great admiration for 
your father's work. My friends Graham and Xceron were his friends 
and long-standing admirers of his father. 

Any personal and unpublished material you might wish to 
communicate to me will be treated with the greatest care, and I will 
send you several copies of the magazine. Please believe me that I 
shall be entirely at your disposal for any similar favor I might do 
for you in the United States, being an iron sculptor myself. You 
will find the questions on the pages enclosed herein; please excuse 
me for asking so many questions, I shall use your answers to the 
best of my ability to write an article appreciating the work of the 
artist and the man Julio Gonzalez as much as they deserve. 



I would like to stress a point that museum officials will never 
make: 

Why was your father not appreciated when he was still alive? 

Why did no one buy when the money from the sales would 
have allowed him to make more sculptures? 

Why must an artist die to be recognized? 

What is wrong with the connoisseurs, given that artists have 
always known and loved the works of your father? 

Fraternally yours, 

David Smith 
[Appendix to the letter] 

1. Who were your father's close friends? With whom did he talk 
about aesthetics? Did he spend time in certain cafes, etc.? 

2. Could you speak a little of your mother, the year of their 
marriage, her feelings about your father's work? Where your parents 
lived? What you remember of your father's devotion to his art and 
his eternal struggle as an artist? 

How did he make a living and obtain the funds necessary for 
his sculpting materials? 

Can you tell me if there were difficulties— without forgetting 
that I am always on your father's side? 

I think that there are certain parallels to my own life and my 
struggles as well. 

3. Approximately how many sculptures did he make? How 
many in iron? 

In a work dating from 1936, Woman with a Sickle, la Monserrat, 
was there a political sympathy with the Popular Front? (In 1936 I 
marched in the Pere Lachaise cemetery with the Cultural Institute 
of Artists.) Was he part of this cultural group? During the Spanish 
Civil War, did your father's sympathies lie with the royalists? Did 
he make posters or other works for this cause? 

4. Did he like music? What kind was his favorite? 

5. I would say that your father was a kind and gentle man, a 
poet, but I cannot write this unless you confirm it for me. I see 
these qualities and more in his work, but if you speak to me of his 
character I can write more truthfully. 

6. What can you tell me about his studios (the size of the 
rooms, kind of buildings)? About his tools? Did he use power tools? 
Did he use an electric welder, the type we call an "arc welder" here, 
or was all his iron work done with gas welding? 



293 



■j. Did the French critics take his work seriously? Did many 
French collectors buy his work? Did the French museums buy and 
show his work during his lifetime? 

8. 1 am very perplexed about the years from 1929-31, when 
Picasso made sculptures with welded iron. Some friends told me 
that "Gonzalez welded for Picasso"— information on this seems to 
vary. 

An American catalogue states that your father taught Picasso 
how to use a welder. Please be kind enough to give the exact cir- 
cumstances. 

Did your father teach Picasso to weld his own sculptures? Did 
he weld for Picasso out of friendship— or did he work for him on 
iron sculptures and construction during this period 1929-32? 

I do not ask this question to make a point, but to establish 
their true relationship. 

9. May I mention your name if necessary? 

10. Could you lend me some photographs not previously pub- 
lished in the Amsterdam-Brussels catalogue for the Art News article? 

Do you have a personal photograph of your father, your moth- 
er, and yourself, or of Gonzalez with his friends? I would like to 
reproduce an intimate, unpublished image of your father. I do not 
want to repeat the documentation in the catalogue. 

I would like to broaden the knowledge of his life and work. 

I promise to take great care of any documents you might be so 
kind to entrust to me with, and to return them; or, if you must 
make copies, I would be happy to reimburse you for them, as well 
as any costs incurred in sending them. 

If you do me the honor of answering my questions I wish to 
thank you in advance. I will do my very best for your father's sake.

Letter, in French, to Roberta Gonzalez. Solomon R. Guggenheim 

Museum Archives, New York. 
Madame Roberta Gonzalez 
Arcueil, France 
Nov. 4, 1955 
Madame, 

I thank you sincerely for such prompt and complete information. 
My delay in answering you is explained by my search for a transla- 



tor for this letter. 

I will take great care of your photographs and will send them to 
you as soon as I have written the article and as soon as the plates 
for the magazine are ready. 

The article has been announced for January, and I will send you 
a few copies. I will make every effort to show the importance and 
the truth of your father's life and work. 

Please find enclosed a photo of the little mask I own. I do not 
know the date. It is of approximately the same size as the photo. 
The silver sculpture in the Philadelphia Museum was purchased in 
1933 by Mr. E. Gallatin. Your father had donated a drawing to Mr. 
Gallatin, and the American painter George L. K. Morris owns a 
drawing purchased from your father. You know about the works in 
the Museum of Modern Art, and you must know and approve of 
the show of pastels and bronzes at the Henry Kleeman Gallery. 

A large number of New York artists knew your father, especially 
between 1930 and 1935 when they met at the studio of J. Torres- 
Garcia. 

I have written to Picasso and Brancusi and many others and 
hope to be able to add to what has already been published on your 
father and his work. 

I have read a laudatory article on a show of your work and your 
artistic talent. 

Soon I shall have some photos of my work from 1955 and I 
will be pleased to send them to you. 

Please accept my gratitude and most respectful regards.

Gonzalez: First Master of the Torch 

From Art News 54, no. 10 (Feb. 1956), pp. 35-37, 64-65. 
The Bull in its symbolic action has stood for many things in 
Picasso's history, things Spanish and things noble. The Bull has 
been the artist, the people of Spain, the open-eyed conscience of 
free men, the disemboweler of the lie of Franco, the aggressive pro- 
tector of women, and among other symbols, the lover of woman. 

But after the death of Julio Gonzalez, Picasso's friend of forty- 
five years, the Bull becomes a skull on a green and blue fractioned 
table before the window curtained in violet and black. 

Coming home from the funeral Picasso had done this picture 



294 



of a bull's skull and dedicated it: "En hommage a Gonzalez." 

To the wall of his studio was tacked a snapshot of his friend. 
For Picasso all source of life becomes the nature of painting. 

On what peaks did memory ride— for they were friends from 
youth, from the days of the Barcelona cafe. "Els Quatre Gats." In 
1 901 Picasso shared Gonzalez' living quarters in Paris until he 
found a studio. Throughout the succeeding years they remained on 
good terms, visiting each other, even working together; and then, 
the end at Arcueil in March of 1942. 

The youngest of four children (the others, his sisters Pilar and 
Lola, his brother Juan), Gonzalez was born in Barcelona in 1876. 
Both Juan and Julio were apprenticed in their father's metal shop, 
becoming third-generation smiths. With other ideas in mind, the 
brothers studied painting at night at the Barcelona School of Fine 
Arts, which Miro was to attend fifteen years later. They knew "Els 
Quatre Gats," the Spanish counterpart of the Parisian "Chat Noir" 
and gathering-point of the local avant-garde. Here the youthful 
Picasso had decorated the walls with twenty-five portraits of writers 
and artists who frequented the cafe. 

During the 1890s the tension between the impoverished multi- 
tudes and the wealthy few of prosperous Barcelona manifested itself 
in a series of strikes, reprisals and acts of anarchy. Dispossessed 
refugees pouring in from Cuba increased the degree and extent of 
the economic problem. 

The intellectual reaction to the social distress and rebellious 
temper of the times was to revolt against tradition and authority 
and embrace the attitudes of "modernism." Thus Barcelona awoke 
to the romanticism of the age, Art Nouveau, the Gothic Revival, 
Wagner's music, Lautrec's presentation of Pans and the Bohemian 
life, Maeterlinck's drama, the Pre-Raphaehtes and the climaxing 
monument to the new art, Gaudi's cathedral. 

I feel Gonzalez coming from Barcelona and looking back lov- 
ingly at Gaudi's Cathedral of the Sagrada Fatnilia, respecting 
Gaudi's source in nature and the unities of iron and stone. 

Gonzalez' notebook contains statements about the new art 
which seem to parallel ideals for the Catalonian Gaudi's cathedral: 
"To project and draw in space with new methods . . . Only the pin- 
nacle of a cathedral can show us where the soul can rest suspended . 
. . These points in infinity were the precursors of the new art." In 
another reference to a cathedral he speaks of "the motionless arrow" 



which to me seems more the arrowhead Excehis Hosanna towers of 
the Sagrada Familia than the Gothic or Romanesque spires which 
he loved in France. His notes several times speak of form by estab- 
lished "points or perforations." There is a marked unity in his stone 
bases and the iron sculpture, a sensitive feeling for material and 
proportion. I feel the kinship with Gaudi's stone angels, their iron 
trumpets and iron arm supports, in the feeling of flying form and 
unorthodox balance. Work by the Gonzalez shop may even be in 
the cathedral. I can find no verification for this, but Jose de Creeft, 
who worked on it as a plasterer's helper at the age of twelve, says 
that every craftsman in Barcelona did. 

The craft work of both brothers progressed so well that it was 
shown in the Chicago World's Fair, 1893, and in the same year 
took a gold medal in the Barcelona Exposition. 

The period from his arrival in Paris around 1899 until 1927 
did not show strong sculptural conviction. This, perhaps the most 
difficult and dramatic period of his life, was the least fruitful. 
Unproductive months followed the death of his brother. Then, 
repousse masks, drawings and painting proceeded out of his strug- 
gle for some fifteen years. 

There seems to have been conflict between the divided identities 
of painter and metal-smith. 

When a man is trained in metal-working and has pursued it as 
a labor with the ideal of art represented by oil painting, it is very 
difficult to conceive that what has been labor and livelihood is the 
same means by which art can be made. (Perhaps I am basing this 
more on sympathy than fact in Gonzalez' case, because it is a 
reconstruction of my own experience. Before I had painted very 
long I ran across reproductions in Cahiers d'Art of Gonzalez' and 
Picasso's work which brought my consciousness to this fact that art 
could be made of iron. But iron-working was labor, when I thought 
art was oil paint.) 

In this period of groping Gonzalez felt the need of men strong 
and firm in their destiny, like Brancusi and Picasso. Undoubtedly 
their encouragement played a part in his slow battle with himself. 
At the same time the very closeness to these two titans personally 
could not permit any influence in his own work. 

It seems true that something kept his painting from flowering. 
At the same time he pursued metal work, which apparently repre- 
sented the sculptural part of his nature before it had asserted its sin- 



295 



gular self. From the chronology of his life and from the knowledge 
of friends, as soon as he accepted his true identity as that of the 
sculptor, his expression became more challenging and his works 
more prolific. Concurrent to this came the use of the acetylene 
torch which was not, I think, a part of his early apprenticeship or 
of the metal-craft period. 

He was past fifty when he accepted the sculptor's identity, dis- 
carded the silversmith's scale and purpose and abandoned oil paint- 
ing formally, accepting drawing as the complement of sculpture. 
Some of the finer parts of craftsmanship were dropped, a casual 
approach technically developed with the dominance of conceptual 
ends. Craft and smithery became submerged in the concept of 
sculpture. The esthetic end was not dependent upon its mode of 
travel. 

The period in which Gonzalez worked for Picasso has not been 
determined by the statement of either as far as I can learn. It does 
not seem important. The technical collaboration made neither 
change nor influence in the conception of either artist. During the 
several years it existed, each pursued his own work in his own way, 
Picasso with his concepts for Mediterranean monument houses, the 
elongated bronze stick figures, etc.; Gonzalez reaching his prolific 
period with Don Quixote, a number of still-lifes, the best of his 
masks and a large number of flying iron drawings, like Standing 
Personage and Woman Combing Her Hair. The possible dates of this 
intermittent collaboration lie somewhere between 1928 and 1932. 

Gonzalez was encouraged by Picasso to continue and expand; 
something very definite was gained by their union, but it was more 
abstract than a recognizable influence. 

The best of Gonzalez is in his abstract work, but existing con- 
comitantly is a socially conscious theme of realism. These are the 
Montserrats or her variations. They start in 1932 with a small head, 
Montserrat, continue to the full-sized figure in 1936 and end with a 
bronze head in 1942. La Montserrat is the symbol of Catalonian 
woman in her nobility, her cries against injustice, her suffering. She 
is the symbol of things noble and things Spanish, analogous to 
Picasso's bull. 

Of the two unfinished plaster works begun in 1941, one was 
abstract; the other a screaming woman on her knees, which parallels 
the Montserrat series in its realism and sympathy. 

I have learned of no notes relating to the realist approach. 



There are no poetic "directions to carve space," no "motionless 
arrows pointing towards the stars where the soul can rest suspended 
or indicate points of hope," as he gives his ideals for sculpture. 
These are volume sculptures, arrived at with great love and patience. 
They show the tremendous urge to speak out in the way the quiet 
man and artist could best present his statement. 

A man as withdrawn as Gonzalez was ordinarily not given to 
fraternizing. An exception was his attendance at weekly meetings 
held at the studio of Torres-Garcfa in the late 'twenties and early 
'thirties. To these discussion evenings came an interesting group, 
mostly young, almost exclusively expatriate: Mondrian, Arp, 
Bissiere (later Helion), van Doesburg, Seuphor, Daura, Xceron, John 
Graham, Vantongerloo, Queto, Charchoune, Cyaky, Brummer and 
others. From the same address was published the magazine "Cercle et 
Carre" edited by Garcia and Seuphor. The painter Xceron, then 
writing art reviews for the Paris edition of the Chicago Tribune, was 
probably the first American to write about Gonzalez' work, which 
he did most favorably and understandingly. Graham, another 
painter-member of the group, was probably the first American to 
buy Gonzalez' sculpture. The three pieces he bought in 1930 were, 
as far as I know, the first in this country. 

A. B. Gallatin, who was known to most of this group, in 1934 
bought a silver sculpture done two years earlier and a drawing for 
his Museum of Living Art. Graham describes the noted sculptor as 
he remembers him in 1930: "Small, dignified, dressed in black like 
a real Mediterranean, lean, greying, a quiet and modest person, 
dreamy and detached, in the way of many thoughtful Spanish men, 
an attractive person looking more in than out. He commanded 
sympathy and respect." 

One of those who knew him best during the last years of his 
life was Henri Goetz, an American painter living in France. In 1937 
Goetz became acquainted with Gonzalez, his wife and sisters 
through Hans Hartung, who married the sculptor's daughter 
Roberta. A strong family friendship developed, with Sunday dinners 
at Arcueil in the house Gonzalez had built according to his own 
plans, and drives through the countryside to look at Gothic church- 
es in an old Citroen Gonzalez bought in 1938. Indicating the 
sculptor's gentle humor, Goetz recalls the way he used to pass the 
weekly dish of carrots and slyly say, "Do take a wing." 

Gonzalez was not much given to art talk or theory and in these 



296 



family discussions of abstraction, Mondrian, Kandinsky, etc. he was 
at esthetic odds with Hartung and Goetz, who took the favorable 
view. 

In one of his infrequent confidences of an esthetic nature he 
told Goetz that he sometimes used the Golden Section (1.6180). 
This mathematical ideal of the relationship of the diagonal with the 
side of the square may be homage to Cezanne and the 1 9 1 2 Section 
d'Or exhibition or something very personal from his painting peri- 
od. The Golden Section has always been a constant in the eye of 
man. It may have been a personal method of evaluating, but it is 
certainly not the inspiration. 

Regarding his own work Gonzalez was adamant in pointing out 
the relationship between his sculpture and the real elements— such 
as hair, teeth, eyes— which in a very indirect way composed them. 
Goetz recalls him buying what was for his circumstances a very 
costly tool— possibly a shearing tool— to work on the teeth of a 
sculpture. The beautiful head of 1936 which Alfred Barr acquired 
in 1937 from Christian Zervos for the Museum of Modern Art col- 
lection clearly illustrates his preoccupation with features. 

Gonzalez was extremely prudent. Early in the war he gave up 
welding, fearing that if bombs dropped his oxygen and acetylene 
tanks would blow up, although the lorry factory less than a hun- 
dred yards away had many tanks in constant use. 

Gonzalez never became a French citizen. He was Spanish, but 
insisted on the distinction of being a Cataloman. 

Critical accent has been placed upon who was first in iron or 
welding. This speculation is no more valid than the Renaissance oil 
paint controversy. Gonzalez was an apprentice in his father's shop, 
his work with metal starts in childhood. It is not innovation that 
makes art but inspiration. On the relationship with Picasso, Xceron 
recalls that he came to Gonzalez' studio in rue de Medeah around 
1928 to work on the statue for the tomb of Apollinaire. In Picasso's 
iron sculpture the concept and the forms are strictly his, as are 
Gonzalez' in his own work. With Gargallo, whom Gonzalez 
instructed, the technique becomes developed in a spectacular way, 
but the concept remains essentially academic. 

The Cubists used iron (i.e. Laurens' Composition, 19 14) as did 
the Constructivists (Tatlin in 1917, Medumezky in 1919, etc.). De 
Creeft made an iron stove pipe Don Quixote in 1925; Lipchitz told 
me of a 1928 iron sculpture he exhibited in his 1930 Paris retro- 



spective show. No one was first. All materials have properties by 
which they are shaped, art lies in the concept, not the technique. 
You can find more art in paper scraps than in crafted gold. 

Wrought metal sculpture goes back to the Bulls of El-Ubaid 
(3000 B.C.) and the life-sized figure of Pepi I from Heirakoupolis 
(2300 B.C.). A whole age of iron welding and forming flowered in 
Syria in the eleventh to ninth century B.C. The iron head-rest of 
Tutankhamen (1350 B.C.), believed to have come from Syria, was 
welded. In Genesis, Tubal Cain, husband of Zilah, is referred to as 
the instructor of every artificer in bronze and iron. Iron welding 
and working has been in evidence in almost every period of culture 
in both art and function.

Dear Roberta Gonzalez, 

I have received your letter. I need help in translating in the mean- 
time, I enclose your photographs and express much gratitude for 
your help in the article in Art News. 

I have asked the magazine to send you some copies. I did not 
write a good article. I am not a good writer and much was specula- 
tion without facts but I hope it will add to the prestige of your 
father's work and make his name better known. How I wish he 
could have had this exhibition and esteem in his lifetime. 

I have just returned from New York, and the beautiful exhibi- 
tion of your father's work. The Museum has installed the exhibition 
expensively and tastefully. It really looks beautiful. The artists of 
New York, and there are many, have all expressed admiration and 
enthusiasm. But, there are a dozen of us who have always recog- 
nized the genius and beauty, the innovation, of Gonzalez since 
1930. In the case of John Xceron since he met your father about 
1927, and wrote about him in the Boston Transcript, and the 
Chicago Tribune (Paris edition). 

I enjoyed your article in the Arts. The same magazine will have 
an article on my work, March issue. My exhibition at the Willard 
Gallery opens March 6. 

My relationship to 'Sagrada Famiha' and the Gonzalez shop was 
speculation. Would his sister know? I'm still searching to learn. But 
certainly he knew the cathedral in Barcelona and had affection for 



297 



it .is he apparently loved all cathedrals. 

A concluding paragraph was cut by the magazine, in which I 
summed up the contribution but that was due to space. The maga- 
zine had asked for 1 500 words and I wrote 2500. 

I hope my admiration was evident throughout the text of the 
article. 

Thank you Madame Roberta and success to you in your own 
work. 

Fraternally, 

David Smith 

Letter to Roberta Gonzalez. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

June 1 1, 1956 
Dear Roberta Gonzalez, 

I visited Edgar [ ] and gave him the Arts with your article. He was 
very pleased. He showed me a drawing your father made of his 
lather and also a ring your father had made for him. The [ 
drawing of his father was a realistic portrait but he did not mention 
whether it was done from life. [ ] played a tape recording of a 
new work which was beautiful. It was made of cut sounds, shaped 
like asculptural forms thrown and perfectly placed in unities like I 
wish to make sculpture. It was compiled from contemporary sounds 
and scores which he had written for orchestra, harmoniously 
arranged. 

I have written Hilton Kramer to send you the March Arts which 
has the article on my work. It will probably arrive later by boat 
mail. 

It takes me time to have your letter accurately translated. My 
French is not good. 

John Graham has no photos, nor does he remember to whom 
he sold or gave the early Gonzalez sculptures. The photo I sent you 
of the work he gave me is the only record of these three. My friend 
Graham is an odd Russian, a painter, a collector, a writer, a trader 
and has never kept a record of his transactions. At the same time he 
bought these works from your father he also was a friend of 
Char[ceu]nne and had a number of his paintings. I'm sorry we can- 
not trace the other two works, but if he should ever remember or if 
they appear, I'll write you. 

When I came to New York to study in 1927, so much new art 



came at once— Constructivism, di stijl, cubism etc. I am not sure of 
my first iron influence. It was probably the reproductions in 
"Cahier d'Art" of Picasso which your father had done for him. But 
certainly I soon saw reproductions of your father's work and was 
told about him by Graham and later by John Xceron. 

Andrew Ritchie [ ] Modern Museum show [ ] within the 
next two years so I shall think hard and try to solve this for the cat- 
alog. 

I worked as a welder, riveter and did ironworking in general at 
the Studebaker automobile factory before I came to New York to 
study art. During the war I worked as an armor plate welder on 
tanks and locomotives. I do much of my work by electric or arc- 
welding. But I started in 1933 on gas welding. I still use gas for cut- 
ting and other work where it is more functional than electric. 
Sculptors who use welding exist here by the hundreds. I am about 
the only electric welder as far as I know. My first electric welding 
was in 1939. I attach no importance to this, it is merely trade talk 
between artists. 

Of course I would like a show in Paris but the cost is beyond 
my means. I will have to wait until my work is important enough 
for some museum or some other agency to arrange it. 

I have loaned the photo of your father's studio (photo which 
was obtained for me in Paris, Marc Vaux photo), to my friend, the 
sculptor Theodore Roszak, who is writing a section on new sculp- 
ture for the Encyclopedia Brittanica. He will use it along with indi- 
vidual works of your father which I also sent him for the 
Encyclopedia. I presume he will record Gonzalez as the father of all 
iron sculpture of this century. When it is published I shall tell you 
and it may be obtainable at the U.S. Information office in Paris. It 
may not be published for several years. 

You should not underestimate the high position Gonzalez' 
work has in U.S. art life. I wish your father could have lived to 
enjoy his position here and I know we all would have loved him as 
a person. I regret very much that I was unable to locate him in 
1 93 5"3&lt;S when Graham tried to take me to his studio. I think he 
had left Paris for the new studio at Arcueil. 

I have read about your work. My friend Herman Cherry 
showed me a review and I should be pleased' to see photos which I 
shall return to you. 

Sometime I hope to sell enough work or receive a fellowship 



298 



and come to Europe. If so, I hope we can meet, I would like to see 
your work and know you. 

In my reconstruction of possibilities in the article on Gonzalez, 
was I mistaken in surmising that work by the Gonzalez family must 
have been in the "Sagrada Familia"? Would your father's sister 
remember if this is true? 

My fraternal greetings, 

David Smith 



time. I try to let no sequence or approach in daily living repeat 
from the day before, but like my work, my day can be identified by 
others. My rebellion is against putting on the right sock and 
punching time clocks. Mozart said after Opus 30 that he had seen 
the light, it would be all different now, but Opus 3 1 sounds consis- 
tent to me. The view is not so important, nor the ideal— but the 
inner conviction which sparks the drive for identity. To me apples 
are fruit— to Cezanne they were mountains. 



Notes on My Work 

From Arts 34, no. 5 (Feb. i960; special issue on David Smith), 

P- 44- 
I cannot conceive a work and buy material tor it. I can find or dis- 
cover a part. To buy new material— I need a truckload before I can 
work on one. To look at it ever)' day— to let it soften— to let it break 
up in segments, planes, lines, etc.— wrap itself in hazy shapes. 
Nothing is so impersonal, hard and cold as straight rolling-mill 
stock. If it is standing or kicking around, it becomes personal and 
fits into visionary use. With possession and acquaintance, a fluidity 
develops which was not there the day it was unloaded from 
Ryersons' truck. 

For bronze castings that are parts, although I have made the 
foundry patterns, I need this perceptual curing. Very often in 
bronze, the parts do not take their original order. 

Rarely the Grand Conception, but a preoccupation with parts. I 
start with one part, then a unit of parts, until a whole appears. Parts 
have unities and associations and separate afterimages— even when 
they are no longer parts but a whole. The afterimages of parts lie 
back on the horizon, very distant cousins to the images formed by 
the finished work. 

• 
The order of the whole can be perceived, but not planned. Logic 
and verbiage and wisdom will get in the way. I believe in perception 
as being the highest order of recognition. My faith in it comes as 
close to an ideal as I have. When I work, there is no consciousness 
of ideals— but intuition and impulse. 

To identify no ideal— to approach each work with new order each 



My sculpture grew from painting. My analogy and reference is with 
color. Flash reference and afterimage vision is historied in painting. 
I chew the fat with painters. My student days, WPA days, Romany 
Marie and McSorley days were with painters— Graham, Davis, 
Resmkoff, De Kooning, Xceron, Edgar Levy, Gorky, Stella, etc. In 
these early days it was Cubist talk. Theirs I suppose was the Cubist 
canvas, and my reference image was the Cubist construction. The 
lines then had not been drawn by the pedants— in Cubist talk, 
Mondrun and Kandinsky were included. 

Probably what turned me most toward sculpture, outside my own 
need, was a talk with Jean Xceron walking down 57th Street in 
1935, the day his show opened the Garland Gallery. That fall my 
wife Dorothy and I went to Greece. 

• 
Most of my sculpture is personal, needs a response in close proxim- 
ity and the human ratio. The demand that sculpture be outdoors is 
historic or royal and has nothing to do with the contemporary con- 
cept. It needn't be outside any more than painting. Outdoors and 
far away it makes less demand on the viewer— and then it is closer 
in scale to the most vociferous opinion-makers today whose 
acquaintance is mostly from reproductions. 

An exception for me started in 1957 with a series of stainless- 
steel pieces from nine to fifteen feet tall. They are conceived for 
bright light, preferably the sun, to develop the illusion of surface 
and depth. Eight works are finished, and it will take a number of 
years on the series to complete it. Stainless steel seems dead without 
light— and with too much, it comes car chrome. 

Jan Matulka influenced me last and most as a teacher, yet Richard 
Lahey's encouragement after the first year of art school was decisive.

I got anarchy and cones and cubes from John Sloan. John Graham 
means much to me, as he did to De Kooning and Gorky. He intro- 
duced me to Davis, Xceron, Gorky and to De Kooning, whom he 
presented as the best young painter in the U.S. He included us all 
in his book, System and Dialectics of Art, finished in 1936. In the 
beginning thirties we drank coffee and hung around together in 
New York like expatriates. Graham lived summers at Bolton 
Landing. His annual trips to Paris kept us all apprised of abstract 
events, along with Cahier d'Art and Transition. In 1935 we were 
both in Paris. His introductions and entry to private collections 
made my world there. On Bastille Day we all paraded with the 
Maison de Culture to Pere Lachaise Cemetery. Though I often 
declaim against things French (except art and wine), Paris for a few 
months meant much to me. I was against the current desire of 
artists for expatriation. After going to the USSR and visiting 
Graham's former wife and children and Benno's sister, I matured 
enough to realize that no matter how inhospitable New York was to 
my work, my life and destiny and materials were here. I was also 
very bad at speaking French. 

In 1934 Graham had given me a Gonzalez, one of three he had 
bought in '28 or '29. These were the first Gonzalez sculptures in 
America I think. When we were in Pans in '35, he took me to 
Gonzalez' studio, but he had moved to Arcueil. I never met 
Gonzalez. Henri Goetz (American painter who lives in Paris), a 
friend of Herman Cherry, sent me photos and told me much about 
him. My first liberation toward iron, which I was acquainted with 
manually, was from Picasso's sculpture of '28-'29. At the time I did 
not know that Gonzalez had done the welding for him. Nor did I 
know when I saw the Gargallo exhibition at Brummer's that 
Gonzalez had taught him welding. Many of us now pay homage to 
Gonzalez. I often think about it, and wish Gonzalez, Gorky and 
Pollock could have had some of the homage sales during their lives. 

From David Smith by David Smith, ed. by Cleve Gray. London: 

Thames and Hudson, 1968, p. 34. 
When I lived and studied in Ohio, I had a very vague sense of what 
art was. Everyone I knew who used that reverent word was almost as 
unsure and insecure. 

Mostly art was reproductions, from far away from an age past 



and from some garden shore, certainly from no place like the mud 
banks of the Auglaze or the Maumee, and there didn't seem much 
chance that it could come from Paulding County. 

Genuine oil painting was some highly cultivated act, that came 
like the silver spoon, born from years of slow method, applied 
drawing, water coloring, designing, art structure, requiring special 
equipment of an almost secret nature, that could only be found in 
Pans or possibly New York. 

And when I got to New York and Paris I found that painting 
was made with anything at hand, building board, raw canvas, self- 
primed canvas with or without brushes, on the easel, on the floor, 
on the wall, no rules, no secret equipment no anything, except the 
conviction of the artist, his challenge to the world and his own 
identity. 

Discarding the old methods and equipment will not of course 
make art. It has only been a symbol in creative freedom, from the 
bondage of tradition, and outside authority. 

Sculpture was even farther away. Modeling clay was a mystic 
mess which came from afar. How a sculpture got into metal was so 
complex that it could only be done in Pans. The person who made 
sculpture was someone else an ethereal poetic character divinely 
sent, who was scholar, aesthetician, philosopher, continental gentle- 
man so sensitive he could unlock the crying vision from a log, or a 
Galatea from a piece of imported marble. 

I now know that sculpture is made from rough externals by 
rough characters or men who have passed through all polish and 
are back to the rough again. 

The mystic modeling clay is only Ohio mud, the tools are at 
hand in garages and factories. Casting can be achieved in almost 
every town. Visions are from the imaginative mind, sculpture can 
come from the found discards in nature, from sticks and stones 
and parts and pieces, assembled or monolithic, solid form, open 
form, lines of form, or like a painting the illusion of form and 
sculpture can be painting and painting can be sculpture and no 
authority can overrule the artist in his declaration. Not even the 
philosopher, the aesthetician or the connoisseur. 

From David Smith by David Smith, ed. by Cleve Gray. London: 
Thames and Hudson, 1968, p. &lt;;o. 
My reverence for iron is in function before technique. It is the 



300 



cheapest metal. It conceptually is within the scale of my life. And 
most important before I knew what art was I was an ironmonger. 
The iron element I hold in high respect. I consider it eidetic in 
property. The metal particularly possesses no art craft. What it can 
do in arriving at form economically— no other element can do. 

Technics 

From David Smith by David Smith, ed. by Cleve Gray. London: 

Thames and Hudson, 1068, pp. 52-53. 
I worked in metal before I studied painting. When my painting 
developed into constructions leaving the canvas, I was then a sculp- 
tor, with no formal training in sculpture. When the constructions 
turned into metals, first lead, brass, and aluminum, combined with 
stone and coral in 1932, nothing technically was involved outside 
of factory knowledge. In the summer of 1933 I made the first 
group of iron sculptures (shown in this country?), two of which 
were exhibited in the winter of 1933 and spring of 1934. My first 
show in 1938 was comprised of work from 1935 on. This work was 
primarily gas welded. The first arc welded piece was made in 1939. 
My method of shaping material or arriving at form has been as 
functional as making a motor car or a locomotive. The equipment I 
use, my supply of material, come from what I learned in the facto- 
ry, and duplicate as nearly as possible the production equipment 
used in making a locomotive. I have no aesthetic interest in tool 
marks, surface embroidery, or molten puddles. My aim in material 
function is the same as in locomotive building: to arrive at a given 
functional form in the most efficient manner. The locomotive 
method bows to no accepted theory of fabrication. It utilizes the 
respective merits of castings, forging, riveting, arc and gas welding, 
brazing, silver solder, bolts, screws, shrink fits, all because of their 
efficiency in arriving at an object or form in function. I make no 
claim for my work method over other media. It is not one of my 
private experience. It is one part of art that can definitely be taught 
or learned by the American aptitude for technics. A course in 
industrial high schools or an 8 week course in trade school suffices. 
The direct method, the part to the whole concept, quantity to quali- 
ty, is not an exclusive approach, and does not exclude my use of 
other media. 

A certain feeling for form will develop with technical skill, but 
imaginative form or aesthetic vision is not a guarantee for high 



technique. I have seen paper cut-outs that were finer art than piles 
of precious metals. 

My own workshop is a small factory with the same make and 
quality tools used by production factories. 

Steel . . . can be stainless, painted, lacquered, waxed, processed and 
electroplated with molybdenum. It can be cast. Steel has mural pos- 
sibilities which have never been used. It has high tensile strength, 
pinnions [sic] can support masses, soft steel can bend cold, both 
with and across its grain, yet have a tensile strength of 30,000 lbs. 
to one square inch. It can be drawn, cupped, spun and forged. It 
can be cut and patterned by acetylene gas and oxygen and welded 
both electrically and by the acetylene oxygen process. It can be chis- 
eled, ground, filed and polished. It can be welded the seams ground 
down leaving no evidence. The welds can possess greater strength 
than the parent metal. It can be formed with various metals by 
welding, brazing and soldering. Metals fall naturally to my use and 
[are] useful to my concept. 

Between periods of trying to get an art education in three mid- 
western colleges I worked as a telephone linesman, stringing cable, 
laying cable, potting lead for joints etc. I used to dig holes in the 
ground of figures and form my own lead casts. I still like to, but in 
molds. After four months in department 346 at the Studebaker 
plant alternating on a lathe, spot welder and milling machine, I was 
transferred to 348 on Frame Assembly. This was worked on a group 
plan, payment made to 80 men in proportion to the completed 
frames which were riveted and assembled on an oval conveyor track. 
It was necessary for each man to be able to handle at least six opera- 
tions. Riveting, drilling, stamping etc. all fell into my duties but my 
interest was the $45 to $50 per week which would enable me to 
study in New York. In a year I did, off and on for five years. 
Painted 5 years. Years ago while working on constructions of vari- 
ous materials in aluminum, stone, brass etc. I realized the inadequa- 
cy of their strength was apparent when trying to make them con- 
form; as I result I turned to steel. 

The medium has been used by Gonzalez and Gargallo and oth- 
ers. Both men have used it in an abstracted manner from a person- 
alized viewpoint. The mental process and the metal both take shape 
in [an] abstract point of view. The objects I had worked with in the 
factory were abstract. They were always functional pieces, having 



301 



relationships but were not objects of realism, gears, cross members, 
brackets, the triangle in a circle, spare tire carrier etc. were all 
abstract parts. 

This work with abstract mechanical parts did not consciously 
exert their influence on an abstract concept developed from realism. 
It resulted in a concept recalling the use of the material. 

From David Smith by David Smith, ed. by Cleve Gray. London: 

Thames and Hudson, 1968, p. 68. 
After my student period in painting finishing with the abstract 
painter Jan Matulka, my painting had turned to constructions 
which had risen from the canvas so high that a base was required 
where the canvas should be, I now was a sculptor. 

I had seen the Picasso-Gonzalez iron constructions of 193 1 in 
the magazine Cahier d'Art. This was the liberating factor which per- 
mitted me to start with steel which before had been my trade, and 
had until now only meant labor and earning power for the study of 
painting. 

My first steel sculptures were made in 1933. They were partly 
made from found ob]ects, agricultural machine parts of past func- 
tion. To a relative degree they relate to my Agricola series, thirteen 
pieces of this group having been completed within the past two 
years. 

My work of 34, 35, 36 was often referred to as line sculpture. 
My first show in 1938 included this work with the balance being 
painted planal [sic] constructions. 

I have always considered line contour as being a comment on 
mass space and more acute than bulk, and that the association of 
steel retained steel function of shapes moving, circumscribing upon 
axis, moving and gearing against each other at different speeds, as 
the association of this material suggests. 

The overlay of line shapes, being a cubist invention, permits 
each form its own identity and when seen thru each other highly 
multiplies the complex of associations into new unities. 

I do not accept the monolithic limit in the tradition of sculp- 
ture. Sculpture is as free as the mind, as complex as life . . . 

Some critics refer to certain pieces of my sculpture as "two-dimen- 
sional." Others call it "line drawing." I do not admit to this, either 
conceptually or physically. It may be true in part, but only as one 



attribute of many, and that by intention and purpose. There are no 
rules in sculpture. This particular criticism is not sufficient or valid 
ground for dismissal. 

I make no apologies for my end-views. They are as important as 
they are intended to be. If a sculpture could be a line drawing, then 
speculate that a line drawing removed from its paper bond and 
viewed from the side would be a beautiful thing, one which I would 
delight in seeing in the work of other artists. The end-view or pro- 
file of an interesting person or object arouses the mind to comple- 
tion of the imagined personality and physiognomy, since a work of 
art or an object of interest is always completed by the viewer and is 
never seen the same by any two persons. 

From David Smith by David Smith, ed. by Cleve Gray. London: 

Thames and Hudson, 1968, pp. 132-33. 
I believe that my time is the most important in the world. That the 
art of my time is the most important art. That the art before my 
time has no immediate contribution to my aesthetics since that art 
is history explaining past behaviour, but not necessarily offering 
solutions to my problems. Art is not divorced from life. It is dialec- 
tic. It is ever changing and in revolt to the past. It has existed from 
the minds of free men for less than a century. Prior to this the 
direction of art was dictated by minds other than the artist for 
exploitation and commercial use. That the freedom of man's mind 
to celebrate his own feeling by a work of art parallels his social 
revolt from bondage. I believe that art is yet to be born and that 
freedom and equality are yet to be born. 

If you ask me why I make sculpture, I must answer that it is my 
way of life, my balance, and my justification for being. 

If you ask me for whom do I make art, I will say that it is for 
all who approach it without pre]udice. My world, the objects I see 
are the same for all men of good will. The race for survival I share 
with all men who work for existence. 

Yes, masterpieces are made today. Masterpieces are only works of art 
that people especially like. The twentieth century has produced very 
many. Present day contemporary America is producing master- 
pieces—a virile, aggressive, increasing number of painters and sculp- 
tors not before produced here. Let us not be intimidated by the pre- 
tending authorities who write books and term only this or that 



302 



Mona Lisa as the only masterpiece. Masterpieces are only especially 
considered works of art. They occur now and they occurred 30,000 
years ago. 

• 
Art is a paradox that has no laws to bind it. Laws set can always be 
violated. That confuses the pragmatic mind. There may exist con- 
ventionalized terminologies and common designations for periods, 
but no rules bind, either to the material substances from which it is 
made or the mental process of its concept. It is created by man's 
imagination in relation to his time. When art exists, it becomes tra- 
dition. When it is created, it represents a unity that did not exist 
before. 

I feel no tradition. I feel great spaces. 
I feel my own time. I am disconnected. 
I belong to no mores— no party— no religion- 
no school of thought— no institution. 
I feel raw freedom and my own identity. I feel a 
belligerence to museums, critics, art historians, aesthetes 
and the so called cultural forces in a commercial order.

Modern an between the two world wars, from the so-called 
"return to order" by some artists in the 1920s to the dream- 
inspired visions of the Surrealists; this complex era, in which 
abstractionists were pitted against those who championed a return 
to figuration, is the backdrop for the "Age of Iron" that Picasso 
and Gonzalez ushered in with their new sculpture. 

In a probing and original essay, Madrid-based scholar Francisco 
Calvo Serraller points out that the "Age of Iron" may also be seen 
as a metaphor for the turbulent years leading up to the Spanish 
Civil War and World War II. But, perhaps looking to the cosmos 
for inspiration, these five artists utilized iron— with its ancient and 
mythical connotations— to suggest the perfect union of body 
and spirit. 

This beautiful and fascinating volume also includes an anthology 
of writings on the theme by the artists themselves, a compre- 
hensive bibliography and chronology, and biographies of the 
artists.
