Preface 



Throughout its history the Guggenheim Museum 
has been concerned with generations of rising 
young artists. But only in 1969 did it become 
possible for the Museum to establish a series of 
exhibitions of younger artists as well as a program 
to purchase one work by each participant in 
these shows, when Theodoron, a foundation com- 
prised of anonymous members, made its first 
contribution to these ends. Now the importance 
of these exhibitions as well as the purchases 
related to them looms larger than at the time 
they took place. The listing in this catalogue of 
participants — so many of whom are now well- 
known — in the two previous Theodoron shows 
should underline this fact. 
We are deeply indebted to Theodoron for pro- 
viding the means to initiate this program and for 
guaranteeing it single-handedly in 1969 and in 
1971. Theodoron remains a contributor to the 
current, third installment of the series but is 
joined by Mr. and Mrs. Irving Rossi, Mr. and Mrs. 
Sidney Singer and The Walter Foundation, whose 
generosity helps guarantee the acquisitions so 
important to the Museum and the artist alike. It 
is our great hope that we will be able to carry out 
this combined exhibition and acquisition program 
more frequently in the future, and that the funds 
upon which such an enterprise depends will be 
forthcoming with regularity. 
The artists and their works were chosen for the 
present show by Linda Shearer, the Guggenheim's 
Assistant Curator, who thereby follows Edward 
F. Fry and Diane Waldman, curators of 
Theodoron's first two installments, in an effort 
to assess a fragment of the current scene and ar- 
ticulate it in an accompanying catalogue text. 
While the Theodoron show was originally con- 
ceived of as international, the second and third 
have focused on American art. Another series, 
pioneered by the exhibition Amsterdam-Paris- 
Dusseldort in 1972, will be continued to present 
young international talent.

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 



Acknowledgements 



Any exhibition is a collaborative effort, but a group 
show is especially so. Members of the Guggen- 
heim Museum staff have contributed a great deal: 
Ward Jackson has visited many studios, viewing 
work by young, often unknown artists and has 
graciously shared his experiences with me; Diane 
Waldman, the Guggenheim's Curator of Exhibi- 
tion's, has provided valuable suggestions and sup- 
port. I am also very grateful to Susan Ferleger, 
who has assisted me on all stages of both the 
catalogue and the exhibition, as well as Carol 
Fuerstein, the Museum's Editor, whose supervision 
of the catalogue has been most helpful. 
I would also like to reiterate Thomas Messer's 
expression of appreciation to the donors whose 
contributions have made it possible for us to add 
important works to our permanent collection. 
Douglas Baxter, Miani Johnson, Renee and David 
McKee. Murray Smither and Stewart Waltzer have 
all been most generous with their time, and I am 
very grateful. I would also like to extend my sin- 
cere thanks to the lenders. 
Finally, it must be stated that the exhibition could 
not have been realized without the great enthusi- 
asm and cooperation of the participating artists. It 
was a great pleasure to work with each one of 
them. 

L.S. 

The reproductions in the catalogue are not in all 
cases illustrations of the works in the exhibition. 
The lenders and the checklist of the exhibition 
are listed in a separate insert. 



Introduction 



Despite the absence of historical perspective, it 
seems fair to observe now that the 70's may well 
pass without producing the kind of revolutionary 
stylistic innovations which have occurred in previ- 
ous periods. In the 60's, for example. Pop Art. Color 
Field Painting and Minimalism emerged with sud- 
den and unexpected force. These were movements 
of remarkable richness and a pervasive influence. 
It is against this background that artists reaching 
maturity in the 70's are compelled to define a new 
sensibility relevant to their specific needs. I tend to 
think that the art of the 70s will ultimately be un- 
derstood as a time in which the younger artists 
were concerned with highly individual statements, 
more consistent with their sense of personal de- 
velopment than with a group identity. The art of 
the 70's has not taken the form of an explicit and 
radical rejection of the past; often inherent in this 
new work is a clear acknowledgement of these 
very sources. It is. however, in a consideration of 
the individual artists and their relation to each 
other that the nature of their unique responses 
may best be suggested. 

Darryl Hughto and John Duff are artists who focus 
directly on the internal structural dynamics of their 
painting and sculpture. Self-contained and self- 
referential, their specific structures tend to define 
themselves. Hughto asserts a compositional for- 
mat of latent equilibrium in his canvases, which he 
feels free to elaborate or confound. Duff's other- 
wise formal constructions become, through his 
unique exploration of materials, unpredictable. 
While Elizabeth Murray and Katherine Porter are 
also involved with formal values in their paintings, 
these two artists are more openly concerned with 
an articulation of conflict. Not only is it conflict of a 
personal, inner nature, but it is also anxiety result- 
ing from the effort to resolve problems raised by 
the history of abstract painting and their need to 
establish a place in that history. In Murray's work 
there is an overwhelming expression of struggle in 
which discord itself seems to become the content; 
her compulsive handling of paint reinforces and 
vitalizes the tension inherent in her deliberate 



awkwardness. In Porter's art, this conflict finds its 
expression in a painterly exploration of those 
sources and traditions with which she feels most 
personally aligned. 

In his miniature balsa-wood environments and se- 
quentially composed paintings, Michael Hurson is 
constructing a world of fantasy in which places 
and characters seem to exist in suspended mo- 
ments of time. They (especially the environments) 
are created with and express an intimacy verging 
on voyeurism. Hurson's rooms allude to a private 
but untold story of their unseen inhabitants, and 
his paintings seem to depict situations cut free 
from their narrative context. Mary Miss' human- 
scale structures are also intimate, but the experi- 
ence of them is a participatory one. an evocative 
encounter which remains ultimately elusive. The 
sculpture inevitably suggests that it might be func- 
tional, yet it exists solely as a concrete statement 
of its own relationship to a particular space. James 
Surls alludes to the ritualistic quality of the object 
in his totemic wooden sculptures, as well as to the 
ritual involved in the activity of making them. The 
quality of whimsy and humor in his work seems to 
undercut and balance the self-seriousness inher- 
ent in the contemporary assimilation of primitive 
art. Finally, in contrast to Surls' work, which en- 
gages us as a participant in the experience of its 
making, the fictional worlds of Steve Gianakos and 
Allen Ruppersberg depend on the detached obser- 
vations of the artist as commentator. Gianakos 
relies on the formal realization of his images for 
the credibility of his humor. Ruppersberg. on the 
other hand, achieves his irony by copying others' 
work, interjecting his own statements in these 
copies, continuously removing himself from the 
original source of his art and playing upon the 
many levels of the act of creation. 
Diversity seems, then, to be the most salient char- 
acteristic of the art of the 70s. However, this di- 
versity, read in its appropriate historical context, 
points to the ironic situation in which both the art- 
ist and curator find themselves today. The 60's 
were a time of confrontation, rapid change and 



media saturation. During this period, art, which 
had hitherto been considered esoteric, became 
dramatically visible and broadly accessible to the 
public at large. Art reached a wide, if sometimes 
unsympathetic audience, and the artist became an 
accepted, if not fully integrated member of society, 
presented with greater opportunities for exposure 
and hence recognition. On the other hand, this un- 
accustomed acceptability has limited the younger 
artist in unexpected ways and has demanded a 
kind of painful withdrawal from group identifica- 
tion. Artists today seem to emphasize their individ- 
ual, private development at all costs, even at the 
risk of losing this recently gained public aware- 
ness of art. 

Critically self-conscious, these artists have 
reached the point at which they feel compelled to 
go beyond the acceptable, even to the extent of a 
deliberate denial of talent in the sense of facility. 
This is not symptomatic of a failure of individual 
talent, but rather indicative of a realistic aware- 
ness that talent is so abundant that it is simply not 
enough. To be good is the rule, not the exception. 

This type of self-questioning originated in the mid- 
60's with Minimal Art and in the early 70's when 
reaction to the formalist, object-oriented art of the 
60's was expressed in a number of ways, in partic- 
ular with Conceptual Art, Earthworks and Body 
Art. Artists renounced the preciosity of the object 
and abandoned the studios and galleries for the 
greater freedom of intellectual space, vast geo- 
graphic areas or even the physicality of their own 
bodies. The ambitious programs of the Conceptual 
and Earthwork artists resonated with romanticism, 
even a kind of heroism, much like that of the New 
York School of the 50's. However, the younger 
artists of the later 70's, while no less consumed 
with the struggle of self-exploration, have begun 
to avoid if not the entire heroic myth, at least the 
heroic posture. Wall-size canvases, like those of 
Pollock. Newman and Still, or even large scale 
decorative painting, comparable to the art of Stella 
and Olitski, are rarely seen in the 70's, for many 
artists are rejecting the notion that art must be 
monumental in order to qualify for a place in the 



history of art. They feel that the associations of 
monumentality must be stripped away in order to 
allow the spectator a direct experience of the work 
itself. As a result, a great deal of small painting 
and sculpture is being produced, and many artists 
now feel free to work with equal intensity in both 
small and large scale. Behind this new freedom is 
the conviction that only through a very personal 
commitment can they hope to revitalize scale as 
an aesthetic issue. 

Their new attitude toward scale parallels, in many 
ways, their reassessment of the role of materials. 
While their choice of materials seems to suggest 
rather disparate intentions, it is necessary to inves- 
tigate the actual handling of those chosen mate- 
rials as they function within the framework of the 
individual's work. Where artists of the 60's placed 
a high premium on the formal values created by 
different materials, the artists of the 70's seem re- 
luctant to experiment with these formal devices 
because they might tend to overwhelm the more 
personal, even slightly eccentric nature of their 
work. The selection and exploration of materials 
as an end in itself was, of course, crucial to the 
more structurally concerned artists of the last 
decade. 

The point is. not surprisingly, since we are talking 
about artists reaching their maturity in the mid- 
70's, that these nine, seen as a group, do seem in 
fact to share some common response to the ex- 
perience of making art. The question must be 
asked directly: does their diversity suggest the col- 
lapse of contemporary sensibility, or does it indi- 
cate in fact a new emerging sensibility relevant to 
the 70's? Surely the question is rhetorical. The 
statements made by this group of artists should be 
seen as an unequivocally positive assertion of 
identity, despite their extreme diversity. Most im- 
portantly, it is precisely in this diversity among 
young artists who are struggling to resolve the 
sources and conflicts inherent in their own per- 
sonal development, that we should attempt to read 
the most articulate statement of this period.
