The folloiving pages are devoted to a selection uj modern sculpture 
from the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection. 

Mr. H irshhorn owns one of the finest and most extensive collections 
which includes historic objects draivn from ancient western civiliza- 
tions and from primitive cultures, as ivell as a distinguished group of 
paintings. 

It is, Iwwever, his large and unique group of modern sculpture that 
has gained for Joseph H . Hirshliorn the respect, the admiration and 
the envy of art conscious people tliroughout the irorld. An inipDitanl 
part of it— the largest to have been publicly presented— is the subject 
of this exhibition and booh. 

The presentation of ''Modern Sculpture from the Joseph II. Hirshhorn 
Collection" is an event of great importance for ithich The .S'o/okio/i R. 
Guggenheim Museum is most grateful. 

Harry F. Guggenheim, /'resident 



To accommodate the exhibition within the available musemn space and to arrive at a harmonious interplay 
between sculpture and architecture are obvious aims that have determined selection and presentation of 
MODERN SCULPTURE FROM THE JOSEPH H. HIRSHHORN COLLECTION at The Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum. The ampleness of the collection far exceeds the capacity of the Museums exhibition 
space even with the scope limited to the modern era and the medium to sculpture. Since reductions beyond 
this point became necessary these were approached with the intention to preserve the balance and the 
emphasis, the range and the personal bias that distinguish the collection as a whole. Daumier, Degas, 
Manzii, Moore, Lipchitz, Smith and other favorite sculptors of Mr. Hirshhorn form islands of great 
concentration in the collection and are therefore also represented in depth in the Guggenheim selection. 
The balance between the collection's already classic portion with Rodin, Bourdelle, Renoir and Matisse, 
to name but a few of the old masters, and Mr. Hirshhorn's demonstrated commitment toward the little 
known and experimental — a balance fundamental to the collector's intentions — was also an element to 
be preserved at all cost in the reduced exhibition version. 

Finally, selection and presentation were determined by the Guggenheim Museum's pducalional urieiitalion. 
an intent to relate, as far as possible, the visual substance of a work of art to its broader historic and 
stylistic framework. 

The presentation of MODERN SCULPTURE FROM THE JOSEPH H. HIRSHHORN COLLECTION at 

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum required a large collective elTort involving tin- (■(ini|&gt;lilc Mu-runi 
staff. The entire undertaking was also dependent upon llu- diligi-iit and informed coiili il&gt;uli(iii&gt; ni.ulc 
throughout tlie project by Mr. Abrani Lerner, Curator of tile Joseph 11. 1 lir^lilidiii ( 'dllcelion. 

Tiiomas M. Messer. Director 



FORE^^ORD .ABRAM LERXER. Curator of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection 



The present exhibition of 4-44 works of modern sculpture from the Hirshhorn Collection is 
the first comprehensive showing of sculptures from the Collection. Three years ago the Detroit Insti- 
tute of Arts exhibited 230 pieces and subsequently 110 of these iiere shown in museums in the Middle 
and Far West. The response was enthusiastic and made all the effort worthwhile, but it tvas disap- 
pointing that New York had no opportunity to see this exhibition. When the Trustees of the Guggen- 
heim Museum suggested a much larger and more comprehensive presentation ivhich would offer an 
even broader survey of modern sculpture, we ivere delighted to cooperate. The result of the collabora- 
tion is the present exhibition. 

Since the text of this book will deal fully with the sculpture, perhaps a few notes on the 
Collection are in order. 

Joseph H. Hirshhorn started his Collection about 30 years ago. Freedom of action, u'hich 
would seem to be a cornerstone of Mr. Hirshhorn s personality, is also characteristic of the private 
collector. This degree of independence is usually not available to most curators and museum directors 
who are responsible to their trustees, budgets, patrons, and history. There is nothing to deter the 
collector from exercising his own prejudices and enthusiasm as long as he can afford them. In conse- 
quence, the private collection has a unique individuality — extravagant in some ways, reserved in 
others. It also has a unique function in that it can complement the historically oriented and carefully 
balanced museum collection by its ivillingness to emphasize particular artists or movements, and to 
welcome the very old or very new with equal ardor. It is free to move in any direction and the degree 
to which it profits from such autonomy is often the index of its quality. 

The Hirshhorn Collection never aimed at an all-inclusive historical survey of sculpture. It 
was and is primarily guided by Mr. Hirshhorn s own inclinations and sensibility, as well as a passion 
for collecting which has long since passed the point of utilitarian need. He most truly fits Sir Herbert 
Read's definition of a collector as ". . . abnormal, a greedy lover of beauty."

MODEM SCULPTURE 1^ THE JOSEPH H.HIRSHHOR^ TOLLECTIOK 



The Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection of Modern Sculpture is perhaps the most comprehensive 
collection of modern sculpture in existence. Comprising between seven and eight hundred works, 
many of monumental scale and importance, it traces with few omissions the entire development of 
sculpture from Rodin to the present day. It is remarkable not only for its general quality and the 
extent of its coverage, but also for its examination in depth of many of the major masters. Some 
statistics will suggest the degree in which this is true. These statistics cannot be precisely accurate, 
because even as they are quoted, new works are in process of being added. Daumier, the one sculptor 
of the earlier nineteenth century who intrigues Mr. Hirshhorn, is represented by some 37 pieces. 
Rodin is represented by 14 works including a major cast of The Burghers of Calais. There are 7 
Rossos, 5 Bourdelles, 11 Maillols, 17 Degas, 6 Renoirs, 10 Picassos, 12 Matisses, 9 Arps, 9 Duchamp- 
Villons, 13 Lipchitzes, 17 Giacomettis, 11 Marinis, 26 Manzus, and 51 Henry Moores. Other leading 
sculptors such as Brancusi, Laurens, Lehmbruck, Archipenko, Hajdu, and Hepworth are each repre- 
sented by several examples. 

Equally impressive is the coverage of newer directions in European and American 
sculpture. Mr. Hirshhorn is constantly looking at and buying the works of younger sculptors. There 
is probably no collection, public or private, which contains so thorough a representation of the 
newest experiments in the sculpture of today. 

The comprehensiveness of the collection has suggested the form of the present book. It is 
arranged as a picture history of modern sculpture, with the illustrations placed in a generally chron- 
ological order by artist, movement, and country. The brief commentary, accompanying the illustra- 
tions, attempts in available space to suggest some of the problems with which sculptors have been 
concerned, and to describe some of the characteristics of the works illustrated. No attempt has been 
made to discuss every artist or every work of art. However, the grouping of artists and works in the 
illustrations will emphasize their particular stylistic directions. 

Biographies of the artists and the checklist of the exhibition are arranged alphabetically 
after the illustrations. These are followed by a selective bibliography.

COMMENTARY h h arnason 



Sculpture in the twentieth century has emerged as a major art for the first time since the 
seventeenth century. Its development in the last sixty years is even more remarkable than that of 
twentieth century painting. The revolution of modern painting was achieved against the background 
of an unbroken, great tradition extending back to the fourteenth century. In the nineteenth century, 
despite the prevalence and the substantial role played by lesser academicians, painting remained 
the single, great visual art, producing during the first seventy-five years masters such as Goya. David, 
Ingres, Gericault, Delacroix, Blake, Constable, Turner, Corot, Courbet, and Manet. The leading 
names in sculpture during this same period were Canova, Thorwaldsen, Rude. David d'Angers, 
Barye, Carpeaux, Dalou, Falguiere, and Meunier. Of these only perhaps Carpeaux has a continuing 
reputation, and he more on the basis of his sketches than for his sentimental genre or monumental 
decorative works. The sculpture of Dauniier, now much admired, was a private art. little known or 
appreciated until its rediscovery in the twentieth century. 

The eighteenth century was also an age of painting rather than sculpture. During that 
century only the sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon may be compared with painters such as Watteau. 
Boucher, Fragonard, Guardi, Tiepolo. or Gova. The seventeenth century, and then principallv in 
the person of Bernini, was the last great age of sculpture before the twentieth. In ihr I'nited States, 
with the exception of one or two men of originality and high competence, such as St. Gaudens. 
sculptors were only secondary figures from the beginning of our history until well into the twentieth 
century. 

When we consider the dominant place which sculpture has held in the iiistory of art from 
ancient Egvpt until the seventeenth century of our era, this decline is all the more remarkable. The 
decline was not for want of patronage. Although the eighteenth century provided fewer monu- 
mental public commissions than the Renaissance or Baroque, the nineteenth century saw mountains 
of sculptural innniirnciits crowding the parks ami |iiiMic squares or adorning llic ailiiterlurr of tin- 
period. By this time, however, academic classicism had achieved such a rigid grip on the sculptural 
tradition that it was literally inqjossible for a sculptor to pain a commission or even to survive unless 
he conformed. The experimental painter could usually find a small group of enlightened private 
patrons, llnweycr. the very nature ol the x nlplnral inciliuin and llie Iradition ol ninclccMlh century 
sculpture as a monumental and public art made this more diflicull for llu- siul|ilnr.

Roniiv 



This was the situation until the third quarter of the century, when Rodin emerged on the 
scene. It is the achievement of Rodin ahuost single-handed to have recharted the course of sculpture 
and to have given the art an impetus that was to lead to a major renaissance in the late nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries. There is no one painter, not even Courbet, Manet, Monet, Cezanne, 
Van Gogh or Gauguin who quite occupies the place in modern painting which Rodin occupies in mod- 
ern sculpture. He began his revolution, as had Courbet in painting, with a reaction against the senti- 
mental idealism of the academicians, through the closest return to nature. The Man with the Broken 
Nose { 1864) (No. 387 t was rejected by the Salon because it was offensively realistic. The re-examin- 
ation of nature was coupled with a re-examination of the art of the Middle Ages and of the 
Renaissance, most specifically Donatello and Michelangelo. Although much of academic sculpture 
paid homage to the High Renaissance, it was the High Renaissance seen through centuries of 
imitative accretions which largely concealed the original works. Rodin looked at Donatello and 
Michelangelo as though they were masters of his own time to whom he was apprenticed, and thus he 
achieved the anomaly of turning its own gods against the academic tradition. 

The achievement of Rodin in the liberation of modern sculpture is one of degree rather than 
of kind. It is possible to find prototypes or analogies among his contemporaries for his treatment of 
subject matter, space, volume, movement, light, and material. However, in no other sculptor of the 
nineteenth century are all the elements and problems of sculpture attacked with comparable energy, 
imagination, and invention. In no other sculptor can be found such brilliant solutions. 

The basic medium of expression of sculpture from the beginning of time until the twentieth 
century has been the human figure. It is in terms of the figure, presented in isolation or in combina- 
tion, in action or in repose, that the sculptor has explored the elements of sculpture — space, mass, 
volume, line, texture, light, and movement. Of these elements, volume and space and their interaction 
have been traditionally the primary concern of the sculptor. In terms of this interaction, the history 
of most of the great periods of sculpture may be written. If the cycles of Classical Greek and 
Hellenistic sculpture, Romanesque and Gothic, and Renaissance and Baroque, are traced, in all three 
may be observed a comparable development from the early or archaic frontality to the ultimate stage 
of figures existing as articulated, three-dimensional masses in fully realized three-dimensional space. 
With the exception of certain works of Bernini such as the Ecstasy of St. Theresa, the final solution 
of most of the cycles of sculptural history has characteristically involved the figure as a relatively 
coherent central mass revolving in. and in some degree interpenetrated by surrounding space.

The greater sense of spatial existence in Hellenistic, Late Gothic or Baroque sculpture also 
inevitably involved an increased sense of implied movement, achieved bv the twisting pose, the 
extended gesture, or frequently by a broken, variegated surface texture whose light and shadow 
accentuated the feeling of transition or change. 

The Baroque feeling for spatial existence and movement was part of the nineteenth centurv 
sculptural tradition, particularly in the monumental works of Carpeaux and Dalou: and Rodin was 
in possession of the full range of historic sculptural forms by the time he returned from his brief 
visit to Italy in 187.5. The Man with the Broken Nose of 1864 was already a mature and accomplished 
work suggesting the tragic intensity of the artist's approach to subject as well as his uncanny ability 
to suggest simultaneously the malleable properties of the original clay and the light saturated tensile 
strength of the final bronze material. 

The Crouching Woman ( 1882) (No. 390) is one of the many individual figures inspired bv 
the experiments of The Gales of Hell,^ on which Rodin had begun to work in 1880. The Gates them- 
selves, which occupied the artist until his death in 1917, and even then had not reached a final form, 
suffer from the very fertility of the ideas and the variety of the forms with which they are crannned. 
Nevertheless they are of the greatest significance in the artist's later career and in the history of 
modern sculpture. Saturated as they are with literarv svmbolism to the point where thev almost cease 
to exist as any sort of sculptural totality, they nevertheless contain a vast repertoire of forms and 
images which the sculptor developed in this context and then adapted to other uses. The liirbiilcnce 
of the subject involved inspired him to the exploration of expressionist violence in \\hirli llic human 
figure was bent and twisted to the limits of endurance, although with rciiiarkaliK lillli- ailual

emphasizing the agony of the figure and carrying the eye around the mass in a series of completely 
integrated views. 

The Iris (1890-91) (No. 392) achieves an even greater violence of pose, carrying the 
sensuality which characterized so many of the later figures to the point of brutality. The headless, 
one armed torso, by its maimed and truncated form, reaches a height of expressive vitality. The Iris 
is probably a sketch, but one which arrived in this form at a completeness to which nothing could be 
added. The sketches of Rodin in their rough immediacy and directness have a natural appeal to the 
twentieth century artist. However, their presentation in posthumous casts, as finished works of the 
artist, tends frequently to distort his actual intention. 

The portrait sculptures of Rodin represent a chapter in themselves in their search for per- 
sonality or for symbol statements. The Balzac in its final form was an exploration of the nature of 
genius, expressed through the means of sculptural "impressionism." The many preliminary versions, 
on the other hand, represented various attempts to recreate the appearance and the personality of 
Balzac and gradually from these sketches to approach a generalized statement. (Nos. 393, 394) 
Whether the final Balzac is or is not a success purely as a sculptural form, it is perhaps the closest 
approximation of nineteenth century sculpture to a purelv abstract svmbol. 

If, of Rodin's sculptures, the Balzac most closely approximates some of the ideals of 
twentieth century expressionist sculpture. The Burghers of Calais (1884-88) (No. 391) sums up most 
successfully his transformation of the past into a monument that is both contemporary and personal. 
The debt of the Burghers to the fourteenth and fifteenth century sculptures of Claus Sluter and 
Claus de Werve is apparent, l;)ut this influence has been combined with an assertion of the 
dignity of the common man, analogous to the sculptures of Meunier. The rough-hewn faces, the 
powerful bodies, the enormous hands and feet transform these burghers into laborers and peasants 
and at the same time greatly enhance their expressive power. The tendency of Rodin to dramatic 
gesture is also apparent here, and the theatrical element is emphasized by the highly unorthodox 
organization, with the figures scattered about the base like a group of stragglers wandering across a 
stage. The informal, open arrangement of the figures is actually one of the most daring and original 
aspects of the sculpture. It is a direct attack on the entire classical tradition of closed, balanced 
groupings in monumental sculpture. The detached placing of the masses gives to the intervening 
spaces an importance which for almost the first time in modern sculpture reverses the traditional 
roles of solid and void, of mass and space. Space not only surrounds the figures but completely 
interpenetrates the group to create a balance which anticipates some of the most revolutionary inno- 
vations of twentieth century sculpture.

Maillol, also one of the major figures of early modern sculpture, began his career as a 
painter. At the opposite extreme from the violent variety of Rodin, he concentrated his whole 
attention on a restatement of the classic ideal of sculpture, stripped of all the academic accretions of 
sentimental or erotic synthetic idealism, and brought down to earth in the homely actuality of his 
models. Concentrating almost exclusively on the subject of the single female figure, standing, sitting, 
or reclining, and almost always in repose, he stated over and over again the fundamental thesis of 
sculpture as integrated volume, as mass surrounded by tangible space. At the same time, the nudes 
of Maillol always contain the breath of life, a healthv sensuousness which reflects the living model 
rather than any abstract classical ideal. ( Nos. 248-251 ) 

Medardo Rosso also began as a painter and in his sculpture, he, in a sense, alwavs remained 
a painter. Even in his most impressionist works, Rodin never entirely abandoned his sense of 
sculptural mass. Thus it is perhaps wrong even to refer to him as an impressionist. Rosso, on the 
other hand, deliberately dissolved the scul|)tural forms until onlv an impression remained. His 
favorite medium of wax allowed the most imperceptible transitions so that it becomes difficult to tell 
at exactly what point the wax becomes the face or the figure. Form is dissolved into amorphous 
shape and light-filled, vari-textured surface. The very subjects, detailed genre scenes, conversation 
pieces, stretch the limits of traditional sculpture. Still, in his freshness of vision, his abilitv to catch 
and record the significant moment, Rosso added a new dimension to sculpture and anticipated the 
search for immediacy which characterizes the experimental sculpture of our own day. I Nos. -103-409) 

Antoine Bourdelle. like Maillol. sought a revitalizing of tiic classical tradition. However, his 
approach involved an eclectic, somewhat archaeological return to the s|)iiil and lurrns of arciiaic ami 
early fifth century Creek sculpture, as well as to those of Cothic sculpture. A yiuillihil pm trail Imst. 
La Marquise (1886) (No. 35) has a serenity which is both classic in feeling and rcminiscci\l ol 
portraits by Houdon. The Warrior I No. 37) from the Moniunenl lo ihr Fiahlers at Montauban 
(1873-1896) represents the moment of greatest indebtedness to Rodin, ami \( ith all its innnense 
power of gesture points to the danger of an attempt lo nul l?i&gt;diii Rodin. This could only lead lo 
theatricality, a danger from \\hich Bourdelle was rescued by his conscious rcUirn lo anliciuily alter 
1900. The Head of Apollo I 1900) (No. 36) is a key work in this return, coinbining as it does a 
consciouslv archaic quality with vitality which makes it more than a mere eclectic adaptation 
of anliipiilv. 

The torso of the figure called /'n/(V or I'onioiui i I'll I) (No. 38) relates mass and spatial 
existence to a (lowing, linear niovcincnl of conlour. Allhough this work and others of Bourdelle's 
female nude figures may be compared with Maillol, they are always clearly individual in their restless 
activity achieved through the accent on moving outlines.

THE .SC'I'LPTOH-PAI^TERS DAVIVIIKR, DEUAS, RENOIR 

One of the most indicative symptoms of the revival of sculpture at the end of the nineteenth 
century is the number of important painters who practiced sculpture. Gauguin, Degas, Renoir, 
Bonnard were among them, followed in this century by Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Braque, Derain, 
Leger, and many others. Maillol and Rosso were both first painters before they became sculptors. 
The pioneer sculptor-painter of the nineteenth century was Daumier, who lived between 1810 and 
1879. Most of his wonderful caricature heads were created in 1830-32 and anticipate late Rodins in 
the directness of the deeply modelled surfaces. (Nos. 65-81) The Ratapoil (18.50) (No. 82) is a com- 
pletely realized sculpture. The arrogance and tawdry elegance of the pose is presented in terms of 
spatial existence and movement in which the fluttering, light-filled flow of the clothes acts as 
counterpoise to the bony armature of the figure itself. 

The sculpture of Daumier is a prototype but not an influence for the beginnings of modern 
sculpture, since it was little known by the sculptors of the first generation. The same is true of the 
sculpture of Degas, most of which was never publicly exhibited during his lifetime. Degas is unques- 
tionably the greatest of the late nineteenth century sculptor-painters. His sculptures were conceived 
in sculptural terms, concerned with the fundamental formal problems of sculpture. Both his horses 
and his dancers rejjresent continual experiments in space and movement. The posthumous bronzes 
retain the sense of the original wax material, built up, layer by layer to a surface in which every 
fragment of wax is clearly articulated. The genre scenes, such as The Masseuse (1896-1911) (No. 
110), seem at first to be curious translations of genre painting into sculpture. However, they also, on 
closer analysis, assert a sculptural mass in a complex spatial interplay. (Nos. 102-113) 

Renoir's sculptures, created towards the end of his life, are more directly translations of his 
late paintings. Since, however, these paintings strongly emphasize sculptural modelling of the 
figures, the translation is a logical and natural one, and the sculptures emerge as simplified, classically 
massive figures in repose or in slow movement. The tradition is that of late antiquity seen through 
the classic peasants of Maillol, the accent on sculptural mass in repose rather than of space or 
movement. (Nos. 375-379)

Wilhelm Lehmbruck, who worked in Paris between 1910 and 1914, also showed in works 
like the Torso (1910-11) (No. 233 I the influence of Mailiol. However, the tragic face of this figure 
reflects a personal expression which becomes more explicit in the great Kneeling Woman I 1911 I. - 
The Head of a Girl (1913) (No. 234) and the Inclined Torso (1913) (No. 235) illustrate the 
Romanesque elongation which Lehmbruck used for the suggestion of inward suffering. These are 
works of delicate power, withdrawn and filled with a spirit of melancholy, works in which the contour 
line assumes a major significance in the definition of the volumes of the figure. The elongation of 
these figures, which is presented with such natural ease that it does not seem like distortion, repre- 
sents a major break from the control of realistic proportions. 

The German expressionist sculptors represented a wide variety of points of vieu allluiugii in 
general they did not depart very far from nature in the direction of expressive distortion or of 
abstraction. Barlach looked back for his sources to German medieval art as well as to the folk art of

FHAIVCE BHAXCLSI 



The scene of the major revolution in modern sculpture, like that in modern painting during 
the first years of the twentieth century, was Paris. One of the first great figures was Brancusi. an 
artist who created no school, but who strongly affected the course of subsequent sculpture. Although 
the development of his sculpture traces a continuing search for the essences of forms which was a 
continuing reaction against the complexity and literary subject of Rodin, Brancusi still admired 
Rodin and admitted him to be the master of the new sculpture. His own sculpture, however, moved 
constantly towards an intensive examination of a few, fundamental forms in terms of which he 
sought to define the nature of sculpture itself. 

A Rodinesque Sleeping Muse (1906),'* whose naturalistic features emerged imperceptiblv 
from the unshaped marble, became the Sleeping Muse (1909-11 1 (No. 39), an egg-shaped form with 
sharply delineated features repeating the ovoid contours, balanced lightly on a flat plane. This in 
turn became the teardrop Prometheus I c. 1911) (No. 40) with features almost disappearing into 
the volume of the head. The process of simplification was continued in subsequent works until all 
extrusions were eliminated and there remained an egg shape to symbolize not only the beginning 
of the world but in a specific sense the beginning of sculpture. 

In his search for essences, Brancusi pointed the way for twentieth century sculptors. He was 
never really an abstractionist, because there was always in his works a subject idea, reduced to a 
single fundamental. Thus, birds became the idea of flight; fish, the motion of swimming: a cock, 
the cock's comb or the cock's crow. 

The simplification of forms involved not onlv the esseiilial slalenient of a subject, Inil the 
essential statenieril of the nature of materials and of the nature of sculpture ilsell. For Brancusi the 
nature of his materials must be stated without qualification. In the carlv archaic heads and figures 
the rough block of the stone defines the image. The marbles and bronzes emphasize the curving 
forms with a lliiish of the highesi polish. The finish is further eniphasized by contrast \( ilh bases of 
rough stone or roughlv hewn uood, {Torso of a ) oiing Mini. 1921 I I No. II l The great wooden

FRAIVrE CUBIST SCI'LPTIKE 



Although his contribution was a unique one and throughout his life he seems a curiously 
isolated figure, Brancusi was not alone in his search for absolutes. The revolutions in painting of 
post-impressionism, fauvism, and cubism were accompanied by comparable revolutions in sculpture. 
In painting, the cubists, beginning in 1907 with Picasso and Braque, sought to destroy finally the 
Renaissance concept of a painting as an imitation of the natural world, as a window opening out 
into naturalistic space. They wished to assert for the painting its own identity, its own pictorial space 
arising out of its own physical nature as a flat canvas surface to which pigment is applied. Their 
explorations led Braque and Picasso first to geometric, Cezanne-like landscapes, then to highly 
sculptural figure studies. By 1910, three-dimensional, sculptural modelling had disappeared, the 
color had been deliberately subordinated to a close harmony of greys, browns, and greens, and the 
subject (figure or still life) had been transposed into a linear geometry of intersecting and frequently 
transparent planes, a sort of 'grid' moving within a confined depth from the frontal plane of 
the painting. 

In sculpture the problem was a comparable search for the fundamentals of sculptural form 
through stripping off all the illusionistic accretions of the Renaissance tradition. Brancusi was 
carrying on his similar explorations but they were not as familiar to the younger experimental 
sculptors as were the cubist innovations of the painters. Cubism, with its strict geometry of spatial 
analysis, seemed immediately applicable to the problem in sculpture, and was quickly adapted. The 
first cubist sculptors were affected not only by cubist painting but, like the cubist painters, by the 
discovery of African primitive sculpture. Picasso's Head of a Woman (1906) (No. 366) in the brutal 
geometry of the features shows in sculpture the same debt to African sculpture as is to be found in 
the paintings of 1907 and 1908. His Head of Fernande Olivier (Cubist Head) (1909) (No. 368) is 
a literal translation into sculpture of a cubist painted head. The Head of Fernande Olivier is most 
important historically as the first cubist sculpture. However, some question may be raised in what 
degree the deep, geometric faceting of the surface actually enhances or clarifies the sculptural form. 

The same question may be asked concerning Archipenko's first cubist sculptures. There is no 
question that Archipenko was the pioneer cubist sculptor. In works such as the Seated Female Nude 
(1909) (No. 3) his use of a barely suggested geometric structure gives to the elegant revolving 
figure a firmness which prevents it from becoming purely decorative. By 1912, Archipenko had fully 
realized the implications of cubism for sculpture and had made contributions of the highest 
significance by opening up voids within the sculptured figure to the point where the historic concept 
of a sculpture as a solid surrounded by space was completely reversed. Now for the first time in 



56 




I'icasso : .%!!. llcai! nj Ffniniiilr IVivirr ( Cubist lleml i . ncliiil pufic 85. 



history, a sculpture became a series of voids or spaces shaped and defined by solid outlines. In 1913 
Archipenko made another great contribution in adapting to sculpture the new technique of collage 
and beginning to make constructions out of difTerent materials such as wood, glass, and metal. 
Although the Medrano figures which he constructed during the next few years tend as sculptures 
towards the mannered and the decorative, the technique which he devised was of immense importance 
in opening the way to the entire field of sculpture as construction, sculpture as space rather 
than as mass. 

The artist of greatest unfulfilled talent among the first cubist sculptors was Duchamp-Villon, 
whose tremendous potential was cut off at his early death in 1918. However, the limited number of 
works he left behind are not only revolutionary in their exploration of new aspects of sculptural 
form, space and movement, they are in their own right sculptural masterpieces. The Torso of a 
Young Man (1910) (No. 131) uses cubist geometry to reiterate and strengthen a classic ideal of the 
figure. The Head of Baudelaire (1911) (No. 132) has the repose and classic structure of ancient 
Greek sculpture, achieved by the balance and extreme simplification of the features integrated into 
the strongly articulated skull. The Seated Woman (1914) (No. 137) combines a traditional twisting 
pose with integrated curves and planes to reach a complete three-dimensional spatial existence. This 
figure has now moved substantially towards abstraction, and the final step is reached in the great 
Horse and the Head of a Horse (1914) (No. 136). The various preliminary versions of The Horse 
such as Horse and Rider (1914) (No. 135) and The Little Horse (1914) (No. 138) trace the develop- 
ment of the idea from a flowing, curvilinear, relatively representational study to the complete 
abstraction of all elements into the final, powerful statement of diagonal planes, concave and convex 
shapes moving, unfolding and integrating space into the mass of the sculpture. Although their 
approach and their solutions are quite different, Duchamp-Villon sought the same essence as did 
Brancusi. By continually stripping away all extraneous details he came at last to complete sculptural 
experience. The portrait head became a mask of few related shapes, lines, volumes (Head of 
Professor Gosset, 1917) (No. 1391; the recognizable Horse and Rider became the abstract space 
machine of the final Horse. 

No other sculptor has explored the entire range of possibilities in cubist sculpture as has 
Jacques Lipchitz, and yet cubism is only one chapter in his extensive and brilliant career. In 1913 
he introduced some geometric stylization into a series of figure sculptures; and by 1915 was 
producing a wide variety of cubist works in stone, bronze, and wood construction. The bronze Head 
(1915) (No. 237) is stripped down to a single rectangular mass penetrated by a few diagonal planes 
and concave accents. The Bather (1915) (No. 238) achieves attenuated elegance with vertical planes 



58 



accented by curved voids at top and bottom. The bronze Reader ( 1919) ( No. 239) and the Reclining 
Nude with Guitar (1928) (No. 242) summarize his more massive and complicated cubism of the 
twenties which also involved an increasing accent on the expression of the subject. Lipchitz con- 
tinued to use geometric structure in the monumental figure compositions of the thirties, but here 
the expressive content became paramount and gradually led to the free, baroque modelling of 
his later works. 

The cubist sculptures of Henri Laurens retain generally a strong sense of the subject, whether 
still life or figure. The frequent use of color, beautifully and soberly integrated into low relief or 
free standing stone blocks, accentuates the relation between cubist painting and sculpture. Many of 
the cubist sculptors experimented with color, as the cubist painters sought relief effects with collage. 
Laurens' cubist works explore most particularly problems of mass in sculpture. By the late twenties 
his interest had shifted to the creation of volumes without mass and he had begun to compose in the 
curvilinear, moving rhythms of his later style. (Maternity, 1932) (No. 231) 

Zadkine has never really deserted cubism, although from the very beginning his cubist 
sculptures took on expressionist overtones. The marble Mother and Child I c. 1913 ) ( No. 438 ) 
illustrates the massive closed quality of his first works. Positive and negative spaces are interchanged 
and the whole is exceptionally tightly organized. However, the interest in the formal elements does 
not prevent an intense statement of the mother-child relationship, which makes of this essentially a 
subject sculpture. He has a particularly fine feeling for the quality of wood, and his wooden 
sculptures [Female Torso) (No. '140) retain the compact, living bulk of the tree form. His later 
sculptures move more and more to a mannered expression, involving elaborations of geometric 
and curvilinear shapes. {Standing Figure, 192.5-28) (No. J39) Although the figures are constructed 
out of a vast variety of semi-architectural fragments, solids interpenetrated bv voids, line? plavini; 
over surfaces, they are still essentially human figures, actors — gesturing, writhing and sutlering. 

Cubism was one of the greatest liberating forces for sculpture in history, ll openeil the 
IKith to new subjects other than the human figure; it led the way to complete abstraction; it ilclined 
the nature of sculpture as an art of mass, volume, and space; and it developed new possibilities in 
the utilization and expansion of these elements. 

Although working independently of the culiists. Otto Freundlich ilcM'lnped a nioiiurneiital

Of the twentieth century sculptor-painters, Matisse has perhaps made the most consistent 
statement in sculptural terms. His Bust of a Woman (1900) (No. 289) uses an impressionist play of 
light over the entire surface to create a curious and ambiguous sense of character; and thus is still 
close to an effect that is painterly. However, the Slave (1900-03) (No. 290), inspired by Rodin's 
Walking Man, is a solid and powerful sculptural mass whose deeply modelled surface accentuates 
the mass. Works like the Decorative Figure (1903) (No. 291), the Large Seated Nude (1907) (No. 
296) and Reclining Nude (c. 1919) (No. 298) use the classical contraposto, the twisting pose of the 
figure, to create spatial existence, in a manner reminiscent of the late Renaissance. The Two Negresses 
{ 1909) (No. 297) again employs a traditional motif popular in the Renaissance, of showing the figure 
front and back, in a group of the greatest structural strength. The sculptures of the late twenties 
and thirties continue to express space through the twist of the figure, and, eliminating or sub- 
ordinating surface, light, texture, reach an even greater degree of expression of the sculptural mass. 
(Reclining Nude No. 2, c. 1929, and Venus in the Shell, 1931) (Nos. 299, 300) 

The sculpture of Modigliani was influenced by Brancusi and by primitive or archaic art. 
However, he was able to absorb these influences into a highly personal expression in the elongated 
and spiritual heads whose volumes are so wonderfully expressive of the rough stone blocks from 
which they emerge. (Nos. 307, 308) 

Picasso's sculptures throughout his life have been essentially brilliant adaptations of his 
paintings, becoming more or less sculptural in the degree that the pictorial experiments variously 
lent themselves to sculptural effects. From the Head of a Jester (1905) (No. 363), suggestive of the 
blue period figures, one can parallel his development as a painter, through the massive, primitive 
wood carvings of 1907, the Head of Fernande Olivier (1909) (No. 368), the cubist constructions of 
1913 and 1914, the surrealist bronzes and constructions of the late twenties, down to all the figure 
fantasies of today. His incredible ingenuity has produced innumerable masterpieces in sculpture; 
in many constructions he has explored problems of sculptural space; he has made many of the most 
brilliant uses of the found object to create works of the most delightful fantasy; yet continually one 
is brought back to the source of the sculpture in his painting or graphic work. (Nos. 363-371) 

Braque, Derain, Leger, de la Fresnaye, Bonnard, Vailotton and many other painters of our 
time have produced important sculptures. The contribution of the painter to modern sculpture is 
very great, in large part because he approaches sculptures from a fresh and non-sculptural — in the 
traditional sense — point of view.

COIVSTKlIlTIVI»&gt;M GAHO AAU I'EVSNEK 



During the first twenty years of the twentieth century manv sculptors were moving inevitably 
to certain basic conclusions on the nature of sculpture. There was first the fact that sculpture forms 
no longer need be expressed through the human figure; and second that sculpture no longer need 
be a three-dimensional mass existing in surrounding three-dimensional space. Brancusi, while 
maintaining the tradition of the solid surrounded by space, translated the figure into an abstract shape 
of an essential simplicity which stated the fact of existence and movement in space with ultimate 
clarity. Archipenko and Lipchitz began to construct from materials of wood and metal to reverse 
the traditional relation of solid and void. The futurist sculptor, Boccioni, dissected and interpene- 
trated the solids to unite them inextricably with the voids and to put them in movement in space. 
Picasso's 1913 relief constructions adapted for sculptural spatial experiment the still lifes of cubist 
painting. 

In 1913 also, the Russian, Tatlin, created purely abstract reliefs which were arrangements 
of planes projecting into and enfolding voids. In 1915, Naum Gabo, then in Norway, began con- 
structing heads of sheets of wood, metal, or cardboard, in which the head became an arrangement of 
voids bounded by planes. The constructivist exhibition of 1920 and the Realist Manifesto issued by 
Gabo and his brother, Antoine Pevsner, drew the inevitable conclusion to which all these experiments 
had been leading. The Manifesto renounced volume and mass as primary sculptural elements and 
substituted depth as defined by planes or lines; it renounced the static rhythms of past sculpture 
and substituted 'kinetic rhythms as the basic forms of our perception of real time.' 

Gabo pursued these ideas in Germany in the twenties and after 1946, in the United States. 
Pevsner, who had been first a painter, settled in Paris and turned to constructivist sculpture. Each 
developed his own characteristic style, but both have continued to explore their stated principles. 
With these men was born a new concept, one of the most influential in the history of sculpture.

The constructivists and their followers developed the direction of geometric abstraction, 
frequently, as in the case of Gabo after 1920, using transparent plastic materials or string or wire 
constructions in order to destroy any sense of bulk and to make all forms and their relationships 
clearly apparent from any point. The search for a new definition of sculptural space was carried 
on in other ways by Julio Gonzalez, who as early as 1908 was working directiv in wrought iron, thus 
initiating the technique of direct metal sculpture which has transformed the nature of sculpture in 
our own time. In the twenties, Gonzalez began to produce wrought and cut iron sculptures, 
techniques which led to a great series of abstracted fantastic figures of open construction in which 
the beaten and twisted metal was expressed with a strong sense of the rough power of the 
material. (Nos. 187-192) 

In 1926 Jacques Lipchitz began to experiment with small open-work sculptures, modelled in 
wax and cast in bronze, but giving the effect of wire constructions. These also were important 
prototypes of the effects sought by many of the direct metal sculptors. In llic late lucnlies Lipchitz 
produced some of his major cubist sculptures. At the same time he was mo\ing auav Imni specific 
cubism and beginning to explore new subjects which demanded new sculptural means. The monu- 
mental Figure (1926-30) (No. 241) is a tremendous primitive totem of overpowering jirescncc. 
The /oy of Orpheus (1938) (No. 243) illustrates the new, free, baroque foiin.- ilr\(lu|iecl duiing the

FHAIVCE ARP AIVII ABSTRACT SCULPTURE 



Although Jean Arp was a founder of Dada, even his earliest collages and reliefs demonstrate 
an innate sensitivity to formal relationships which tended to override the sense of fantasy. When he 
began to do sculpture in the round at the end of the twenties, his seriousness of purpose as a 
sculptor became most apparent. Fantasy still persists down to the present day, frequently emerging 
in delightful elements of humor, but the serious and brilliant pursuit of the 'human concretion' is 
paramount. Arp belongs in the line of Brancusi. although the effects he seeks are entirely his own. 
Although, as he himself has said, all his sculptures are torsos, the torso is refined to a biomorphic 
shape, realized in space, solids and voids creating a sense of pulsating life which makes the figure 
move and change form before our eyes. This is a complete art of metamorphosis, of objects whose 
being is the act of becoming. (Nos. 9-16) 

The tradition in sculpture stemming from Brancusi, of extreme purity, has strong followers 
throughout the world. Chauvin. working largely in isolation, has sought a limited perfection. 
Gilioli uses a geometric rather than an organic base, breaking up the beautifuUv polished marble 
block in precise rectangles or triangles, or controlling slightly curving pyramidal forms with sharply 
delineated contours. Hajdu, in his marbles, creates precisely and elegantly outlined profiles of 
suggested figures or flowers. (Nos. 57, 180-182, 197-201) 



FRANCE FANTASY 



The element of fantasy, present in the works of Jean Arp. and in a highlv different manner 
in Gonzalez and in many works of Picasso and Lipchitz, has been a continuing and ever increasing 
force in modern sculpture. The Merzhau of Schwitters and the ready-mades of Duchamp inaugurated 
a tradition of 'found object' sculpture which has reached a fantastic climax in younger sculptors of 
today. Most of the surrealists have tried their hand at sculpture. Miro has produced sculptured 
figures (Personage, 1953) (No. 305) as well as ceramics with all the appealing madness of his 
paintings. Max Ernst has in recent years turned increasingly to sculpture. Works like Moon Mad 
(1944) (No. 150) ox Mother and Daughter (1959) (No. 151) present little Martian figures which can 
be menacing or funny and sometimes both. 



102 



The great master of fantasy in modern sculpture is Giacometti. The early works are 
surrealist dream creations in a specific sense, with strange objects scattered about a large plane, to 
establish a mood of haunting mystery in which space or emptiness becomes a sensation of over- 
powering loneliness. It is this quality which he has continued to seek in the sculptures of the last 
twenty years. In these, enormously elongated figures stand or walk in isolation, lost in a great void 
of the spirit. These are not fantasies in the sense of the deliberate shock practiced by the surrealists. 
They are, rather, tragic expressions of mankind suffering, isolated, and unable to communicate. 
(Nos. 16.5-176) 

Germaine Richier created a world of monsters in bronze, whose pitted and broken surfaces 
take on the quality of lacerated and torn flesh, rotting and decomposing. These are yet very human 
and sympathetic monsters, capable of grief and suffering, and even at times of a clumsy, macabre 
humor. (Nos. 380-384) They are the ancestors of a whole generation of monsters who people the world 
of sculpture today. In France, the principal exponent of this tradition is Cesar, whose l\'ude 1 19.581 
(No. 52) is simply a pair of legs with lower torso, horribly and w-onderfully eroded and made more 
horrible by the curious sense of life which still remains. La Maison de Davolte { 1960 1 I No. 54 I . 
built up out of fragments of scrap iron, is a huge structure, suggestive of a figure torso or a flattened 
out head in which the primary expressive element is the fantastic texture of the entire surface. 
Here the decay of the materials conveys a larger message of decay in which there is still a kind of 
order and beauty. Cesar represents in a work like this the great international development of 
so-called 'junk sculpture,' sculpture assembled from any sort of found objects, old fragments of 
metal, the rubliish which slowly piles up at the edges of the modern industrial world. This rubbish 
is seen by these sculptors as part of the landscape of our society, a landscape of decay, destruction. 
and death, in which, nevertheless, there is a hope of revival, a new life, the creation of beauty from 
ugliness. Always present in this tradition is the idea of change, of metamorphosis as the controlling 
force of both the scul|)tiirc and ot lile itself. 

Cesar also experiments with a much more ordered and controlled scul|ilurc. Miirsrillcs 
( 196t)) {No. 53) is a great architectural, sculptural relief whoso surface is built up of a large number 
of small, regular, shifting and overlapping planes, gradually compressing into a closely textured, 
vibrating central area.

ITALY 



Since the second World War, sculpture has received an enormous impetus not only in France 
and Germany but even more dramatically in Italy, England and the United States. The older artists 
in the new Italian sculpture had established reputations before the war. but in the last twenty years 
these reputations have become international. Manzii was influenced by Rosso but his real love is 
Donatello and the Italian Renaissance. The Dancer with Skirt (1956), Dancer (1954) and Girl in 
Chair (1955) (Nos. 261. 258, 259) are conipletelv traditional works which have, nevertheless, a light- 
ness and vitality which make them contemporary. The Girl in Chair (1955) particularly, with its 
introduction of the seemingly prosaic chair, illustrates the close study of nature in which the artist's 
works are rooted, and also the poetry which he is able to instill into the subject. The Cardinal series 
{Standing Cardinal, 1954) (No. 256) take a conventional subject and draw from it a mood of 
withdrawal and mystery, at the same time utilizing the heavy robes to create a simple and monu- 
mental sculptural volume. The sketches for the great series of religious reliefs for Salzburg 
Cathedral look back to Ghiberti as well as to Rosso in their free, impressionist handling, and to Delia 
Quercia in the classic modelling and order of the individual groups. Manzu as a sculptor is an 
anomaly — a Renaissance artist who has established his place in the contemporary world, a traditional 
sculptor who is never academic. 

It is perhaps one of the greatest strengths of modern sculpture as compared with modern 
painting, that even among experimental sculptors no one point of view is ever dominant to the 
exclusion of all others. The rise of abstract sculpture did not see an accompanying decline in 
figurative sculpture. Today throughout Europe and the United States may be found schools of 
realist, expressionist, abstract expressionist, abstract geometric, all flourishing and all contributing 
to the strength of the modern movement in sculpture. 

Marino Marini was also an established and mature artist before the war, already experi- 
menting with his favorite subjects including the horse and rider theme. His art is more violently 



126 



expressionist than that of Manzii, both in the distortion of the forms and in textural elaboration of 
the surfaces. The Susannah ( 1943) (No. 278) illustrates the solidly obese figure that he has continued 
to favor, the primitive modelling of the features on the surface of the head, and the textured surface, 
with paint worked into the gouges to add color and textural variety. The figures of the fifties became 
niijre angular, sometimes elongated, the naive, primitive element more pronounced, and the color, 
worked in an arbitrary series of geometric areas, is frequently a dominant note. {Dancer, 19.54) 
(No. 282) 

Marini is a brilliant portraitist. His portrait heads are all characteristic Marini heads, 
surfaces grooved, slashed, torn, and vari-colored, forms distorted, features exaggerated; vet thev 
catch in an uncannv degree the expression and the personalitv of the sitter [Curt Valentin, 19531 
(No. 281). 

The horse and rider subject began to interest Marini in ihr late thirties and during the 
war it became for him a symbol for suffering and homeless humanity. The earlier versions of the 
forties are plump, sedate, and relatively relaxed, reminiscent of Chinese carvings of peasants on 
oxen. As he continues with the subject the action becomes more dramatic, the horse and rider more 
angular and attenuated. The horse, with elongated widely stretched legs and upthrust head, screams 
his agony. The rider with (Uillluriu stumps of arms falls back in a violent gesture of absolute despair. 
[Horse and Rider, 1950-53) (No. 279) 

Many of the younger Italian artists in reaction against the reputation aiul inlluence of 
Manzu and Marini, have turned awav from figuration and are working in various veins of free 
abstraction. Of these, one of the most impressive and original is Fietro Consagra. who creates in 
bronze and in wood, great plaques whose surfaces are penetrated and undercut to create a mosaic ol 
strange shapes and suggested figures who have their lib- in an ambiguous depth behind llie surlaee 
plane. (Nos. 58, 59)

£j\ftiILA&gt;U 



The postwar development of sculpture in England is even more phenomenal than that in 
Italy, since there had been produced in England very little sculpture of consequence between the 
Middle Ages and the twentieth century. The first, major modern British sculptor (if the brilliant 
but tragically short-lived Gaudier-Brzeska is excepted ) was Epstein, an American by birth, whose 
whole career was centered in England. In his stone carvings Epstein used a geometric simplification 
to emphasize the shape and the weight of the stone block in the creation of primitive images of brutal 
power. In his bronze figures and portraits the bronze reflects the highly fluid modeUing and texturing 
of the clav. The Visitation (1926) (No. 147) is one of his masterpieces of religious sculpture, a 
beautifully and sensitively modelled figure, filled with a spirit of profound pathos. The portrait of 
Joseph Conrad (1924-2.5) (No. 146) illustrates his qualities as a portraitist. The texture of a relief 
map, the heavily undercut brows, the hooded, piercing eyes, the energetic, inquiring pose, all combine 
to give a sense of living personality. 

Of present-day sculptors in England. Henry Moore is the dean and unquestionably the most 
fertile and creative mind. The early stone sculptures show influences from those of Epstein as well 
as from primitive African and pre-Columbian art. In the Mother and Child { 1931) (No. 309) he has 
developed the more rounded treatment of the stone which is identified with him. The figures are 
carved with simple monumentality, the material of alabaster is strongly expressed, and the distortion 
of the enveloping left arm together with the small, primitive, alert head of the mother, gives to the 
group a compact structure and a definite emotional impact. In the early thirties. Moore turned to 
abstract forms and by opening up the masses and creating dispersed groups he studied various kinds 
of space relationships. Here started his continuing fascination with a sculpture of tensions between 
space and solid, between positive and negative spaces. These experiments were soon translated back 
into figures in which he opened up great voids which became the material of the sculpture, rather 
than the stone or wood. {Family Group, 1945) (No. 313) 

The exploration of spatial problems led Moore in the forties and fifties to a greater use of 
bronze, in which material he could open up the figures to the point where the bronze was simply a 
frame, defining the forms of the voids. Interior-Exterior Reclining Figure (1951) (No. 315) is one 
of a series of intricate and subtle arrangements of solids and voids achieving a complete interpene- 
tration. During the war Moore had made thousands of drawings of the underground air raid shelters. 
These inspired some of his most tender family groups and some of his most classic, restrained and 
monumental draped figures {Draped Reclining Figure, 1952-53) (No. 319). The early fifties brought 
forth new experiments in attenuated, angular 'bone figures'. The King and Queen (1952-53) 



140 



(No. 320) with their masks for faces, their flattened out, leaf-like figures, attain a sense of personality, 
of a regal dignity. The Falling Warrior (19.56-57) (No. 330) is a macabre and tragic symbol of a 
world bent on destroying itself. In the mid-fifties, as well, Moore produced a series of "L pright 
Motifs' of which the most notable is the Glenkiln Cross (1955-56) (No. 329), a gigantic and savage 
totem, which links the Christian symbol to the fertility columns of primitive mankind. 

Moore, working with a relatively limited number of subjects — reclining figure, mother and 
child, family group — has yet attained an enormous range of expression in his sculpture. He has 
explored the entire range of sculptural forms and materials, and has alwavs brought his explorations 
back to problems of humanity. 

Although certain of her forms may derive from those of Henry Moore ( her experiments 
with strings to balance and define the voids of certain sculptures of the fifties probably stem from 
similar experiments carried on by Moore in the forties) Barbara Hepworth reallv belongs to the 
tradition of Brancusi and Arp. Her search has been primarily for abstract, organic forms of the 
greatest purity which define basic spatial problems. Pendour (1947) (No. 205) attains great spatial 
variety within the simplicity of the total form, with white color being used to accentuate the voids. 
In some of her recent bronzes, such as Porthmeor (Sea Form) (1958) (No. 207) she begins to 
investigate freer shapes, more roughly textured, containing a suggestion of some living organism. 

Moore and Hepworth stand somewhat aside from the younger British sculptors of the 
postwar era. Reg Butler has developed an impressive and highly expressive figure style, which has 
more in common with Marini and the Italians than il lias with Moore. [Manipidalor, 195-1; Girl. 
1954-56) (Nos. 46, 47) Armitage, Meadows, Chadwick. Frink explore their separate and highly 
individual problems of expression in lironzes of violent action or macabre repose. Paolozzi is the 
principal British exponent of the 'junk sculpture' or 'found object' school. Out of all the detritus ol 
decayed machines he creates marvellous monsters of ferocious vilalitv, whose incredible agglomera- 
live surfaces, reflecting in bronze the thousands of nuts, bolts, wires, and other machine parts, take 
on the pathetic beautv of a dviiig rivilizalion [Large Frog. 1958) (No. 359). One of ihc niosl indi-

I':VITEI» STATES 



Modern sculpture in the United States is so extensive and varied, and the Hirshhorn Collec- 
tion is so rich in exajnples that only the briefest outline of some of the chief tendencies and figures 
can be attempted in limited space. America has also had her sculptor-painters. Thomas Eakins 
created accomplished genre sculptures; Max Weber experimented successfully with cubist sculpture. 
Larry Rivers and Jasper Johns are now working in the field of sculpture. (Nos. 140-143, 433, 385, 
214) 

Until the second World War, sculpture in the United States was plentiful but largely tradi- 
tional. Of the pioneers. Nadelman of course was an international figure, trained in Europe. His 
sculptures alternate between the highly accomplished marbles and bronzes, combining an academic 
classicism with an art noiiveau elegance; and the painted wooden figures, delightful puppet-like 
commentaries on the urban life of the early century. (Nos. 337-343) 

Gaston Lachaise was also trained in Europe, although he came to America in 1906. His 
enormous, regal women, balanced on their slender legs and feet, seem at times to be almost carica- 
tures of their Maillol origins. These are amazing figures, combining grotesque obesity with an 
incredible elegance of movement. (Nos. 222-228) 

William Zorach is the dean of the traditionalists, an artist whose works have maintained 
qualities of simplicity and monunientality of the classic tradition. (Eve, 1951) (No. 444) In 
various modes, traditional figurative sculpture has been carried down to our own times by Maldarelli 
{Bianca No. 2, 1951) (No. 2.52), Jose de Creeft (Dancer, 1949-57) (No. 101), Chaim Gross (Per- 
formers (See Saw), 1944) (No. 194) and Saul Baizerman (Mother and Child, 1931-39) (No. 19). 
Baizerman's technique of hammering figures from sheets of copper created, in serenely classical 
figures of the Maillol tradition, studies of volumes without mass. The hammered-out voids of the 
reverse become abstract sculptures in which space is the medium. Most of the leading American 
sculptors of the earlier generation were carvers in stone or wood. Of these, John B. Flannagan was 
outstanding in his ability to express subject and material so that thev became inseparable. The 
Mother and Child (Not Yet) (1936) (No. 155) envelops the two heads and the mother's hand in a 
single, encompassing movement which gives all the essentials of the emotion expressed. The roughly 
textured surface of the grey fieldstone is not only stated as material, but serves to unify the figures 
into an entity. Flannagan's studies of little animals are sensitive translations into stone of an 
immediately caught and characteristic gesture or position. Flannagan. like Brancusi, was seeking 
essences. Without ever deserting representation, he sought continually for the simplest, most ele- 
mentary and yet basic statement of the subject. 

Reuben Nakian. who has developed into one of the most impressive and monumental of the 
direct metal sculptors, using geometric forms for expressive effect, was originally an outstanding 
figure sculptor (Ecstasy, 1947) (No. 344). A brilliant series of terra cotta incised reliefs translate 
his teacher, Lachaise, into high comedy (Nymph and Cupid) (No. 349). 

The major international figure among American living sculptors is Alexander Calder, whose 
reputation is as great in Europe as it is in the United States, and whose works are known and enthu- 
siastically collected all over the world. His wire circus figures and portraits of the twenties are 



160 



delightful toys and are also iiiiportant in the development of new sculpture forms, since they 
literally are direct metal sculptures in which the metal wire is used to define the voids which are 
the primary forms. He is thus a pioneer in the concept of sculpture as space. With the invention 
of the abstract mobile in the early thirties, he incorporated actual rather than implied motion as a 
central element for sculpture. The earlier mobiles owed much of their inspiration to Mondrian in 
their classic purity. His long friendship with Miro and his own innate feeling for humor and fantasy 
soon led him to his characteristic free, organic shapes in terms of which he has made a thousand 
expressive variations, frequently continuing to combine them with geometric forms. He works 
now with an endless repertoire of organic and geometric shapes in the creation of mobiles and 
stabiles which are delicate, massive, humorous, menacing in turn, wires and flat shapes, black or 
brilliantly colored, encompassing space and shaping movement. (Nos. 48-50) 

In recent years motion has become a central interest of artists in Europe and America. 
Experiments in the use of mechanical means for creating effects of movement are carried on con- 
tinuously, as well as those wherein (as in Calder's mobiles) the delicate balance of the free elements 
causes them to move with the slightest breath of air. Jose de Rivera, in his beautifullv and meticu- 
louslv crafted constructions, uses movement as a frame rather than as a central part of the structure. 
His sculptures are thin sheets of steel or aluminum or iirilliantlv polished coils which encompass 
and shape space. As these slowly rotate on their bases, the effect is that of giving the spectator a 
gradual succession of completely integrated views. (Nos. 123-125) 

The tradition of Brancusi and Arp has today few major followers in the United States. 
Of these the most important is Isamu Noguchi, whose works in all media — stone, metal, wood, 
clay — embody many different approaches, but maintain the consistent classic clarity of Brancusi 
combined with shapes of the Japanese ceramic tradition. (Nos. 354, 355) Of the younger sculptors. 
Rosati has until recently created in marble and bronze delicate and elegant figures which are personal 
variants of the tradition of Arp. He is now working in a still highly sini|ilifir(l luil more massive 
idiom reminiscent of Freundlich and Wotruba. (Nos. 400-402) 

The greatest single development in American sculpture during the last twenty years has 
been in the direclion of direct metal scul|)ture. forced anil \\('lded: aiifl latch in the cast bronze 
sculpture which incorporates ideas and elements frnin the constructivist tradition. The artists of this 
direction are many and varied in their approaches. Cenerallv their sculpture is non-representational,

iiivtliical beasts. (Nos. 246, 247) The problem of space has increasingly occupied Ferber, 
first in his cage and roofed structures and most recently in his great environmental sculptures into 
which the spectator can walk. (No. 15.'3) Recently, sculptors of the direct metal school have been 
turning to bronze casting in "lost wax," frequently using techniques and forms of constructivism. 
Philip Pavia builds up his figures in wax on armatures of wood and cardboard which play an im- 
portant part in the effect of the final bronze. (No. 360) David Slivka molds sheets of wax into 
undulating forms which present the thesis of sculpture as volume and space both abstractly and 
traditionally. (No. 415) 

In America as in Europe, direct metal sculpture has now led to a wild outburst of 'found 
object' or 'junk' sculpture. The industrial society of the United States with its fantastic graveyards 
of wrecked automobiles or decaying machinery, lends itself to the symbolic interpretation inherent in 
the works of this school. Among them, Stankiewicz creates articulated figures in which the function 
of the original machine becomes integrated into the decrepit man-machine it has become. (No. 425) 
Julius Schmidt transforms machine parts into classical, balanced architectural bronzes in which the 
rust of the original takes on a new textural beauty. (No. 412) 

The figurative school of sculpture has continued and increased in strength in recent years. 
Baskin, looking back to Barlach. creates obese little figures that are both defiant and pathetic, as 
well as owls that easily dominate the human figures. (Nos. 27-32) Glasco strangely suggests both Arp 
and Lachaise in inflated, highly polished bronze figures whose compressed features or pygmy heads 
foretell the death of the intellect. (Nos. 183-186) William King carries on the tradition of Nadelman 
in carved and bronze mannikins which are delightful satires on contemporary life and classic tradi- 
tions. (Nos. 215, 216) The list of accomplished figure sculptors among the younger generation is 
long and growing. Their approach is dominantly satirical or bitterly critical of the world in which 
they live. Harold Tovish, in beautifully finished bronze, gives us a world of death's heads, torture 
victims, and the lost and isolated spectators who are mankind. (Nos. 427, 428) 

The possibilities of wood as a sculptural material are being re-explored, not only by the 
figurative sculptors but also by carvers and constructivists working more abstractly. Raoul Hague 
for many years has shaped tree trunks into powerful semi-abstract forms which combine the living 
movement of the tree with sculptural structure of masses in space. (No. 196) Gabriel Kohn has 
developed geometric constructions of heavy wood strips glued together and shaped with the pre- 
cision of machines. (No. 217) Louise Nevelson, using fragments of furniture, boxes, and balustrades, 
painted uniformly black or white or gold, has created great wall structures of overwhelming threaten- 
ing power. 

There are in the United States, as in any country, sculptors who defy classification. Joseph 
Cornell is unique unto himself, combining in his wonderful little boxes, elements of surrealism with 
American troinpe I'oeil, to create an image at the same time naive and sophisticated. (Nos. 60-62) 

These few comments have only touched on a number of the directions and interests of con- 
temporary American sculpture in terms of a few of the leading or typical sculptors. Most of those 
represented in the exhibition and illustrated in this book could not even be mentioned, as the 
result of limitations of space. There are obviously a number of important sculptors not yet repre- 
sented in the collection. The illustrations will indicate, however, the range and the vitality of 
American sculpture today. It only remains to say that we are living in the most vital and varied 
period in the history of American sculpture, the period in which this art has come of age, and the 
United States has taken her position as an international force.
