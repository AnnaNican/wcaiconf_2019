Jim Dine: Walking Memory, 1959-1969 

Germano Celant and Clare Bell 



248 pages 

i$6 reproductions 

Jim Dine (b. 1935) is one of Americas best-known 
image-makers. This book, published to 
accompany the first major exhibition of Dines 
work from the 1960s, reproduces a broad selection 
of his early mixed-media works, paintings, and 
sculptures. Many of the works featured in this 
volume contain elements of the now-familiar 
themes of Dines career: tools, robes, hearts, 
palettes, and domestic interiors. Bringing 
together fascinating performance photographs 
with vivid full-color reproductions, the book is 
the first to explore the complex relationship 
between Dines mixed-media works and his 
environments and theater pieces. 

With essays by Germano Celant, Clare Bell, and 
Julia Blaut; an interview with the artist, 
combined with a selection of his poetry and 
statements; and superb colorplates of the works 
themselves, Jim Dine: Walking Memory. i 959 - I9 6 9 
is an important addition to scholarship on the 
1960s, perhaps the most significant period in 
American art. Also included are a detailed 
chronology and select bibliography.

Preface 
Thomas Kretu 

I met Jim Dine for the first time in 19^4, at his studio in 
Putney, Vermont. Only three years earlier, he had moved to 
the foothills of the Green Mountains straight from four years 
of an expatriate's life in Europe. He was already a master ot 
paintings, drawings, and prints. I had long been an admirer 
of Dines accomplishments in the 1960s and was eager to see 
firsthand the new directions his work had taken. His self- 
imposed years away from the tenter of the American scene 
had considerably changed the dynamic of his work and 
process. I found new motifs to contend with, and his paint 
and lines were much looser In feel. His abstract field 
paintings with various objects attached had given way to a 
more traditional style of portraiture and still life. It was 
obvious to all concerned that Dine had undergone a radical 
rethinking of his aesthetic goals. 

In the summer of [976, I had the privilege to sit down and 
talk to Dine about the course his art had taken during the 
decade following the explosion of Pop art. Our conversation 
formed the foundation for an exhibition and catalogue of 
Dines printwork from 1970 to 1977 at the Williams College 
Museum of Art, which I organized. Dine approached our 
talk with the same kind of straightforward acumen that he 
brought to his art. It was an earnest and educational 
discussion about his ideas, his work, and his life history. Dine 
had begun to attack the figure with a vengeance, using an 
approach shaped by memory and the notion of the mirror 
image. The caustic quality of his previous subjects had been 
replaced by classical distortions of form and modeling. The 
graphic, facile quality that had sustained his earlier works 
had been replaced by a richer palette that shifted emphasis 
away from the mark on the canvas or page to the subject 
itself. I began the interview by asking why Dine had taken 
up figuration with such tenacity after his celebrated 
performances and mixed-media works of the 1960s. He told 
me that he had never left it. 

The decade from 1959 to 1969, which Dine spent living and 
working among New York's coterie of avant-garde artists has 
often been treated as an anomaly with respect to his later 
work. He was one of the first to introduce raw emotional 
content into performance art and was one of its most 
controversial champions. Yet, he only created five 
performance pieces. Dines earliest paintings were equally 
celebrated. The store-bought items he attached to his paint- 
filled canvases were brimming with an exhilaration of the 
new, only to be replaced in the next decade with classical 
figuration evoking the past. I remember Dine telling me that 
during this ten-year period he had felt an enormous amount 
of anxiety over achieving fame as an artist so rapidly and at 
such a young age. The fact that his early work was turned 
into a Pop art spectacle was even more discomfiting to him. 
Dine shifted the tenor of his work at the end of 1969 in order 
to save the artist in himself. While Dines motifs remain 
some of the most cherished images in American art, his 
desire to be a painter has always superseded any aspirations 
he might have had for celebrity. I le continues to be one of the 
most provocative painters of interiors. Without an 
understanding ot his initial body of work, it would be 
impossible to grasp Dines unique abilities as an artist 
engaged with such issues as perception and subjectivity. It is 
the Guggenheim Museum's privilege to present this survey of 
Dines earliest work so that audiences are afforded the chance 
to learn about one of America's most intensely fast mating, 
1 hallenging, and formidable artists of the 1960s. 



Jim Dine: Walking Memory, xg$p rp6p continues the 

institution's commitment to in -depth analysis oi the crucial 
early oeuvre of artists. Dine joins fellow American artists 
Robert Rauschenberg and Helen Irankt ntlukr, whose early 
endeavors have been the subject of recent exhibitions at tin 
Guggenheim. It would be impossible to have realized this 
project without the support, guidance, and t lose- involvemeni 
of the artist himself. Although I know he would rather have 
been working in his studio, he made sure that he was 
available whenever his memories, resources, and candor 
proved indispensable to a better understanding of his work. 
It has been personally ami professionally gratifying to have 
continued a dialogue with Dine. I lis insight and enthusiasm 
about art is evident throughout these pages and in the 
exhibition itself. 

The curators of the exhibition are Germano Celant, Senior 
Curator of Contemporary Art, and Clare Bell, Associate- 
Curator for Prints and Drawings. Each has brought an 
enormous amount of skill and insight to the project. Both 
contributed essays to this catalogue and moderated the 
discussion with Dine about his work that forms the basis of 
this publication. They each have been assisted by numerous 
staff members as well as those outside the institution whose 
expertise and archives have been invaluable. I would also like 
to thank the Cincinnati Art Museum, our partner venue in 
this endeavor, especially Barbara K. Gibbs, Director, and 
John Wilson, Curator of Painting and Sculpture, along with 
Jean E. Feinberg, former Curator of Contemporary Art, for 
their considerable support. Another note of thanks is due to 
PaceWildenstein Gallery, most especially to Arnold 
Glimcher, President, and Susan Dunne, Director, w host- 
efforts at locating works and providing critic. il information 
about them have been essential to the show. 

The Florence Gould foundation provided much-needed 
support, for which I am extremely grateful. To the lenders 
who have agreed to part with their works temporarily in 
order to realize this momentous and rare exhibition, the 
Guggenheim, its curators, and our audience owe an 
enormous debt of thanks. To all those individuals who, each 
in their own way, have helped guide the project to fruition, 1 
wish to express my deepest appreciation. 



Acknowledgments 

Germano Celant and Clare Bell 

Long before the quotidian was canonized as Pop, Jim Dine 
implicitly understood the beauty of the prosaic. When he 
first emerged as a maverick on the New York art scene in the 
late 1950s, he was younger than most of his contemporaries 
and without much formal training. His willingness to take 
chances and experiment with new idioms of expression led 
him down a historic path, first as a chimerical performance 
artist and next as the creator of some of this century's 
most recognizable images. While Dine's association with the 
nation's Pop art movement during the 1960s was involuntary, 
his passion for the American landscape of objects remained 
steadfast. There have been numerous shows devoted to 
aspects of Dine's work. None, however, has focused 
exclusively on those crucial years between 1959 and 1969, after 
which he beat a hasty retreat from the New York art scene. 
It is a story that bears telling, but one that would be 
impossible to do without the involvement of numerous key 
people, most especially the artist himself, who has permitted 
us almost unlimited access to his memory and whose 
formidable vision and contribution to the art of our time are 
clearly evident in these pages. 

Assembling the contents of this exhibition and catalogue 
might best be described as a treasure hunt. The artist's own 
archive does not nearly record the breadth of his work that 
exists from the period. To gather the plethora of materials 
from which to select required an enormous commitment and 
resolve on the part of the exhibition's coordinator. That job 
was expertly filled by Kara Vander Weg, Project Curatorial 
Assistant. Her professionalism, keen eye for detail, and 
expertise in the field of art were instrumental in the effective 
realization of the project. We also owe her a tremendous debt 
of gratitude for the willingness and enthusiasm that she 
brought to every facet of this undertaking. A special thanks 
is extended to Dine's studio assistant, Marre Moerel. Her 
tireless efforts in coordinating every detail of the artist's 
involvement and her encyclopedic knowledge of his work 
made such a publication and exhibition possible. We would 
also like to thank Anna Costantini, together with Marta 
Leget and Lucia Brignamo, for their assistance. 

This exhibition and publication could not have succeeded 
without the efforts of museum staff members from every 
department. We are indebted to Thomas Krens, who as 
director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and a 
scholar who has studied Dine's work, has given his full 
support to this project. Suzanne Quigley, Head Registrar for 
Collections and Exhibitions, and Lisa Lardner, Assistant 
Registrar, were responsible for coordinating the shipments of 
Dine's work from a multitude of locations, a formidable task 
that they completed with astonishing ease. Carol Stringari, 
Senior Conservator, expertly applied her knowledge to 
protecting the fragile works from this period of the artist's 
career. Ellen Labenski, Assistant Photographer, responded to 
photographic requests with speed and accuracy, assisted by 
Kimberly Bush, Photography and Permissions Associate. 
The exhibition could not have been mounted without the 
invaluable efforts of Karen Meyerhoff, Director of Exhibition 
and Collection Management and Design; Sean Mooney, 
Exhibition Design Coordinator; Maria Concetta Pereira, 
Design Assistant; Mary Ann Hoag, Lighting Designer; Peter 
Read, Jr., Manager of Exhibition Fabrication and Design; 
Jocelyn Brayshaw, Chief Preparator; and Barry Hylton, Art 
Handler. Others who helped to shape this project were 
Marion Kahan, Exhibition Program Manager; Peter Katz, 



former Senior Budget Analyst; Scott Gutterman, Director of 
Public Affairs; Alexandra Bodner, Public Affairs Coordinator; 
Ben Hartley, Director of Corporate Communication and 
Sponsorship; Anne Chase-Mustur, Development Coordinator; 
Jessica Ludwig, Chief Graphic Designer/Exhibition Design 
Coordinator; Julie Lowitz, Assistant General Counsel; Erica 
Hausladen, legal department; and Nina Wong, Manager of 
Budgeting and Planning. We are thankful to Michael Lavin, 
Technical Support Manager, and Paul Kuranko, Electronic 
Art and Exhibition Specialist, for their skillful coordination 
of the technological aspects of the project. A special thanks 
is also extended to Bonnie Katherine Cheng, Project 
Curatorial Assistant, for her invaluable assistance in the 
coordination and research associated with this project. 

This catalogue was realized through the boundless talents 
of the Guggenheim's Publications Department. For his 
discernment, guidance, and the central role he took in the 
implementation of this catalogue, we would like to thank 
Anthony Calnek, Director of Publications. Massimo Vignelli 
provided the creative force that shaped the design of the 
catalogue, and we are grateful for his contribution to this 
project; likewise, we thank Letizia Ciancio, of Vignelli 
Associates, for her work on the catalogue. We were extremely 
fortunate at the museum to be able to utilize the talents of 
Elizabeth Levy, Managing Editor/Manager of Foreign 
Editions, and Esther Yun, Assistant Production Manager. 
Their mastery of the immense number of details surrounding 
the production of this book was of paramount importance 
to its successful publication. Overseeing the research on 
Dine's performances from the period was Julia Blaut, 
Assistant Curator. Her essay in the catalogue is a result of her 
exceptional acumen and her outstanding work on this period 
of Dine's career, and represents one of the most 
comprehensive studies of his theatrical-based works ever 
completed. Sloane Tanen, curatorial intern, greatly assisted 
her in this endeavor by compiling the often obscure research 
information. We would also like to extend our gratitude to 
Alia Rachkov, who transcribed the interview between the 
artist and the exhibition's curators and who worked as a 
curatorial intern. Demonstrating great knowledge and 
sensitivity to the subject matter at hand, Stephen Robert 
Frankel, editor of the exhibition catalogue, gave 
incomparable help in shaping the material contained within 
these pages. Meghan Dailey, Assistant Editor, provided 
invaluable advice and assistance. We also thank Liza 
Donatelli, Administrative and Editorial Assistant. 

Many individuals generously dedicated their time and 
energies to the exhibition as interns and volunteers. This list 
includes Kathleen Bell, Kerry Junge, Dong-yeon Koh, 
Jonathan Lackman, Stephanie Nannen, Florencia Oris De 
Roa, Kerri Smith, Taliesin Thomas, and Hilda Werstchteul. 

The staff of the PaceWildenstein gallery provided generous 
assistance in locating and documenting Dine's works from 
the period. We would especially like to thank Arnold 
Glimcher, President, Susan Dunne, Director, photographers 
Ellen Page Wilson and Gordon Riley Christmas, and Alina 
A. Pellicer, Manager of Research and Archives. 

The catalogue serves as the first comprehensive color 
documentation of many of the works from this period in the 
artists career, and the skills of many individuals have 
contributed to the photography shown here. Although they 
are credited individually for their work, we would like to 
thank photographers Jorg P. Anders, Ruriel Anssens, Dirk 
Bakker, Oscar Balducci, Mimmo Capone, Geoffrey Clements, 
Sheldan C. Collins, Susan Einstein, Tom Haartsen, Robert 
Hausser, David Heald, Martha Holmes/Life Magazine,

Sasha Cutter and the staff of Monacelli Press; Dorothy 
Gutterman, Melina Mulas and Valentina Balzarotti Barbieri 
from Archivio Ugo Mulas; and Peter Namuth from the 
Hans Namuth archive. 

It was through archival research that we were able to 
resurrect much of the valuable information about the artist 
and the period. For their assistance in obtaining archival 
materials, we thank Robert Bertholf, Curator of the State 
University of New York at Buffalo Poetry/Rare Books 
Collection; Warren Bunn, Curatorial Assistant, Herbert F.

92nd Street YM-YWHA; Anita Reuben Simons; Ileana 
Sonnabend, Antonio Homem and Laura Bloom from the 
Sonnabend Gallery; Richard Stillwell; and Amy Wilson, 
Special Projects Coordinator of the Judson Memorial Church. 
We are also grateful to the staff members of the various 
libraries we frequented while compiling information for the 
project. For generously sharing their scholarly resources with 
us, we are indebted to Martha Boyden, who as Arts Liaison 
at the American Academy in Rome provided research 
concerning Dines works in Italian collections; Jean E. 
Feinberg; Marco Livingstone; and Joseph Jacobs, Curator of

"I Love What I'm Doing": Jim Dine, 1959-1969 

Germano Celant 



The object-paintings of those artists who began their careers 
in the 1950s — as harbingers of what would become known as 
Neo-Dada, Pop art, and the New Realism — appeared on the 
scene like an ironic reversal of history. If one acknowledges 
that in World War II people pillaged and killed in the name 
of history; that the very facts of history are full of sorrow and 
death; that the protagonists of history are hypocrites who 
mask their misdeeds with false ideals; that, finally, history is 
a tragedy — then one might easily admit that the banal, 
grotesque comedy of day-to-day existence, with its common, 
impersonal identity in which objects intrude on the lives of 
everyone, is a thousand times better. The tragic and the 
remarkable, the dramatic and the exceptional can be 
countered with the comic and the ironic, the obvious and the 
trivial, because ordinary acts are no less significant than 
extraordinary events in their effect on us. Actually, the 
object-painting is more the product of skepticism than of 
social concern. None of the creators of object-paintings — not 
Jasper Johns, not Arman, not Claes Oldenburg, not Jean 
Tinguely, not Jim Dine — reveres the things he paints or 
incorporates into his works. If there is anything they want to 
prove, it is that there is nothing intrinsically ideal or Utopian 
about objects, nor do they possess any evil in and of 
themselves that might lead the world to ruin. Things can 
only show the uniformity and simplicity of a world based 
on habits and facts, where the construction and definition 
of an individual's creativity is free of all prejudicial positions 
other than that of the choice of the objects selected and 
represented. This "low" social awareness is not to be 
considered either superior or inferior to the "high" social 
awareness of an artistic procedure that sees itself as 
aristocratically standing above things. What we have, then, 
is a redemption of art through a critical, ironic attitude — 
one that does not aspire to celebrate the positive or negative 
hero typical of a wartime or postwar culture with a taste 
for drama and history, such as that of Action Painting 
or Abstract Expressionism. Rather, it seeks to present 
itself as a detached, impersonal document of a society 
characterized by the recognizability of its things and objects. 
It is able to discover things and see everyday events as 
components of a situation that is based not on an abstract 
perspective or a nihilistic ideology, but on an evaluation of 
the practical exigencies of life in terms of the universal 
conditions of existence. 

Dine's painting itself arises as an antithesis to historical 
painting, as comedy instead of drama, as a taste for the 
particular instead of the universal. The theme of his art is 
the contrast between the everyday life of little things and 
little people and the solemn ruins of the universal view of an 
ambitious society caught up in the definition of history. It 
deals in the customary exchange of truth and illusion, and 
offers an alternative of values based on the evidence of a 
reality that allows no other option than the fact that it stands 
before us all. In the presentation of the thing or the object, 
the subject or protagonist of "history" begins to disappear, 
or at least to define a more localized, individual history. It 
is thus the beginning of a more authentic existence both for 
the artist and his or her art — both being no longer vehicles 
of symbolic values and secondary meanings, but definitions 
of an identity that is personal and linguistic, particular 
and formal. 

The need that, around 1959, yielded the great production of 
object-paintings by the artists of Neo-Dada, Pop art, and the 
New Realism was not so much a need to clarify the 
relationship between the thing-in-itself and the space of art, 
or between the unit and the whole, the object and its context

(as was the case with Marcel Duchamp); rather, it was a need 
CO explain a new relationship occurring between the human 
being and the things to which he or she is bound, no longer 
connected to them for abstract, intellectual reasons but for 
concrete, utilitarian ones. The attempt to give objects a 
symbolic and universal meaning was no longer of interest. A 
thing is no longer a metaphor for something else, but rather 
goes back to being a thing — a light bulb or a paintbrush, a 
can or a hammer, a pie or a chair. However, the meanings 
attributed to it by those who look at it remain many and 
various, to the point that one may reasonably conclude that 
each of these meanings is transitory — that the thing is no 
longer transformed into something other than itself, but 
rather becomes an occasion for ideas, serving only as a 
temporary repository for those ideas it arouses through 
mental associations. It does not convey them; it is only at the 
disposal of the different meanings that each person might 
attribute to it. The thing, in fact, must be left alone; it 
remains a thing, however open it may be to people's ideas. 

The object and the thing are therefore only what they are. 
They must be accepted in all their crudeness, which is 
neither beautiful nor ugly. They cannot be explored or 
interpreted; what is of interest is to present them or 
reproduce them in all their plain, banal obviousness, 
concerning oneself with clarifying and exacerbating the 
conflict between their "thing-ness" and our notion of what is 
human, establishing a current of sympathy and equilibrium 
between their external condition and the reality beneath it — 
each being equally unknowable. This indeterminate, 
indiscriminate acceptance of the object or thing, as an entity 
that creates a problem that one cannot ignore, masked, at the 
time, a sort of heretical position with respect to the gestural, 
heroic manner of the Abstract Expressionists, who still 
asserted the power and authority of the individual as a 
protagonist interacting with the forces of history. In asserting 
the mere fact of an object or thing, the intention is rather to 
isolate reality, unprejudiced and intact, from its historical 
interpretations. This means reducing to zero, not increasing 
and deepening, the value of experience. Lacking historical 
experience — indeed, negating it — the artist deliberately 
renounces any attempt to imagine the past or future; he or 
she must stick to the present, to a reality that does not 
include the possible, a truth that does not extend to the 
probable, and thus is bound to the detail, to the minimum 
dimension of space and time, to what happens here and now 
and is registered without one's seeking its causes or drawing 
conclusions. 

This position, which aims at going beyond the sublimating, 
ideological character of art in favor of an involvement with 
the things of the world, has its historical roots in the art of 
Caravaggio in sixteenth-century Italy.' It continued in the 
seventeenth century in the still lifes of Italian painter 
Evaristo Baschenis and in the eighteenth century in those 
of French painter and engraver Louis-Leopold Boilly, 
appeared in the United States in the trompe-l'oeil works 
of nineteenth-century painters William Michael Harnett 
and John Peto, and has made its way through the art of the 
twentieth century in a variety of mediums and forms, in the 
work of such artists as Duchamp, Giorgio Morandi, Alberto 
Giacometti, and Balthus in Europe, then given new life by 
Johns, Dine, and other American Neo-Dada and Pop artists, 
and continuing to this day in the work of Jeff Koons anil 
Charles Ray. Based on an observation of the real, this art 
declares a detachment from historical imagination as well as 
from an approach that constitutes the painting as reality 
itself, autonomous and independent of the person. The work

is bound not only to the person creating it, but is a thing 
whose existence is circumscribed in time and space. This 
direct take on the world renews the objectification and cold 
contemplation of reality: it is an attentive, objective 
observation of things, without the excitement and high 
emotional pitch that are characteristic of so much of the 
history of art from Mannerism to Action Painting. 

How are we to trace the development of this artistic 
language that does not conform to drama or tragedy but 
rather to everyday life? It represents something that occurs 
not through any historical imperative but by chance, without 
any distant causes or important consequences. According to 
this perspective, art sees things and then identifies their 
reasons for being; it assumes an object and then 
acknowledges its character as individual vehicle. This 
procedure makes no explanation, except, perhaps, a 
posteriori, and one becomes aware of the latter only because 
it belongs to the absolute present and not to the past. 

That Dine is interested in a painting of facts and not 
history, of recording and not imagination, of particularities 
and not universality, of the ordinary and not the exceptional, 
is confirmed by the fact that he immediately declares himself 
an artist through things. He asserts that the reality of art, 
and of his own self, can no longer come out of the convulsive, 
emphatic gestures, improvised and unconscious, of Abstract 
Expressionism, but exists and is motivated through the inert, 
inanimate presence of objects — and requires just as much 
involvement and skill on the part of the artist, since objects 
too are part of the turbulent stream of life, albeit quotidian, 
everyday life. All the same, Dines involvement is different 
from that of Duchamp or Johns. He does not take ordinary 
things out of their everyday context and put them into a new, 
previously unrelated context, such as the walls of an 
exhibition space or the canvas of a painting, in order to 
negate them. Rather, he adopts them and reverses roles with 
them: It is they that are empowered to construct the art 
object and establish the identity of the artist. In Green Suit 
(fig. 27) and Untitled (After Winged Victory) (fig. 29), both 
1959, the reversal of the relationship between reality and 
painting transforms everyday objects such as cotton and 
nylon garments into artistic realities. The garments in the 
latter work become a sculpture resembling the form of the 
famous Hellenistic marble statue Victory ofSamothrace, 
ca. 200 B.C., and give shape to the pictorial surface of artistic 
being. Here, things become a strategy of painting; they 
occupy its vital territory, which is determined by the poles of 
the artifact and its artificer, the art and the artist. The 
object-thing acquires its reality in the sculpture or painting; 
it is used on the various planes of three-dimensionality and 
two-dimensionality, and is borrowed by them to constitute 
the classical figures of sculpture and painting. Dine recognizes 
the object-painting's or object-sculpture's link to tradition 
and respects it, but he also demands a new value. He takes 
cognizance of them as objects made of objects that remain in 
time only if isolated and removed from the flux of their 
banal existence. These objects, which have no place in the 
ideal space of history, nevertheless evoke the passage of time, 
for they reveal and underscore a situation of extremity and 
ending, as a kind of still life. From the latter's origin in 
Caravaggio and the still-life painters from Peto to Duchamp, 
Dine's work is descended symbolically and metaphysically, 
deriving from that same turning of the gaze to the memento 
mori, which he inevitably carries within himself. It is a 
vision that flows unchanged throughout his painterly 
adventure, right up to the present day, even when the things 
and objects he used seem to have lost their predominance 



over the attention paid to the history of classical images. 
Nevertheless, the attention to everyday things as well as to 
archaeological artifacts reflects the same interest in human 
activity, whether present or past. Indeed, the presence and 
emergence of things implies an absence of the human beings 
who, as in still lifes and artifacts, do not live in them but 
survive in them. 

In the end, the generation that would leave its mark on the 
1960s, the generation bound up with Pop and Minimal art, 
embraced objects and materials because it felt convinced 
that human actions and their dramatic expression — as 
embodied by Action Painting and Abstract Expressionism — 
had lost their value and run their course. It was not, however, 
a free choice, but one made of necessity in a culture that left 
the imagination to the mass media and mass society, a 
culture in which consumer products had become the primary 
objects of people's fantasies. For in a time when the society 
we are up against dominates all aspects of existence and yet 
has no development or meaning, what else can that society 
be if not a vast compendium of impersonal, anonymous 
objects, signs of death? 

In all Pop and Minimal art, the idea of death, because of 
its crystallization of experience and thought, 2 recurs with 
incessant, obsessive insistence. The artists who made these 
kinds of art were prompted to seek in the ready-made or in 
the impersonal construct the boundary between this world 
and an equally problematic beyond, the moment where being 
passes into the absolute immobility of non-being. It is in this 
sense that the transition between body and thing, gesture 
and embrace, action and recording, presence and absence, is 
revealed — as demonstrated in the paths traveled by such 
artists as Yves Klein, Piero Manzoni, Oldenburg, and 
Dine. In their work, reality is entirely itself, and objects 
are mortal remains, fragments of an existence in which 
the human event comes to an end: they cut short all natural 
growth, fixing art in a rigid, absolute state. The object 
is the boundary of contrast and contiguity with non-being. 
Thus, it is transformed into a trace of existence, as in 
Klein's Anthoropotnetrie, i960, Manzoni's Artist's Shit, 1961, 
Oldenburg's performance piece Circus ( Ironworks/ Fotodeatb), 
1961, and Dine's Green Suit. Naturally, the theme of mortal 
remains must also be seen in relation to the sudden 
transition from one existential condition to another, as 
witnessed in the work of these artists by the separation and 
catharsis of the body — typical of performance pieces and 
Happenings — and its transformation into a thing, event, and 
energy flow from mobility to immobility, from flesh to 
industrial material, from truth to simulation. 

Behind the crude and realistic obviousness of the thing, 
behind its congealed state, lies hidden an idea of much 
consequence for contemporary art. Life is dream, death is 
awakening, dream and illusion are history, while reality is its 
opposite: it is revealed and can be touched only when sleep is 
broken and its continuity is replaced by the non-being and 
immobility of the thing. Dine is conscious of this tragic 
nature of an art that wants to attain a borderline condition, 
and thus attempts to forge a bond between dream and 
object, history and thing, as he did when he created an 
ancient sculpture out of pieces of ordinary clothing in 
Untitled (After Winged Victory). He seeks representation 
through what cannot be represented, resorts to the non-being 
of things to create the being of art, or at least of its memory. 

In resorting to the use of a second skin — clothing — in 
Untitled (After Winged Victory) and Green Suit, Dine attempts 
to make the reality of art and its protagonist, the artist, 
autonomous, detached, indifferent, by making art out of 



16 



things that are external to history and to people. In so doing, 
he seeks to put Art and the Artist in front of himself, as 
objects that cannot be known or have yet to be known. And 
neither can art and the artist know themselves; they are 
always "other" even to themselves, possessing a reality that 
must be searched for and made concrete as a separate entity. 
This approach can be considered a first declaration of a 
conceptual detachment, or at least a first taking of a 
semantic position, in which the work is transformed into an 
objectified example of historical and individual language 
that must be analyzed for its logic and namings. 

Dine thus proposes a shift in the order of the known in 
terms of art history and the identity of the protagonist. 
Knowledge is expanded, and both become objects subjected 
to the process of semiological reduction.' Both Untitled 
(After Winged Victor) ) and Green Suit are doubles; they 
signal a faithfulness to artistic tradition and to all that is 
life, and have significance as memory and self. Whoever 
wishes to make art must overcome the Action Painters' 
visceral identification with the object and instead assume 
a stance of deathlike indifference. One must fix one's sights 
on something without action or change, see oneself as an 
icon in the guise of an immutable image. Dine immediately 
found these in two realms: that of his prenatal memory up 
to the time of his becoming an artist, represented by a 
reconstruction (for what is reconstruction if not memory?) 
of the Victory ofSamotbrace, symbol of definitive, harmonious 
archetypes; and that of quotidian existence, at first in the 
form of masks that refer to his own face, in works from 1959 
ranging from Head (Hiding Face) (fig. 18) to Altar for Jeremiah 
(fig. 24), which also features a protruding phallus. His is a 
journey toward the mystery of history that coincides with a 
return to preexisting forms and traditions, a journey toward 
the prenatal state that every artist knows or should know 
before stepping into the vast territory of contemporary 
artistic existence. This is a territory of amnesia where all 
that matters are the self and one's own existence on the 
chessboard of the present, which we can see in Green Suit and 
The Checkerboard, 1959 (fig. 20). 

Between these two poles of historical removal and personal 
removal begins the artistic adventure of Dine, who pays 
absolute attention to the shadow of History and strict 
obedience to the inner law of his own existence as person. 
His painting, at the time, is an affirmation of existence and 
his own active presence in every fragment, every instant of 
the finite reality of life and the infinite reality of art, 
exemplified by A 19^ Pa/ett, i960 (fig. 26). It is an artistic- 
procedure formulated moment by moment, to escape the 
pitfalls of non-creation and non-being, of physical and moral 
inertia and death. Precisely because his art is achieved by 
wrenching from nothingness the moment that immediately 
afterward will fall back into nothingness, Dine is not content 
for it to be only a contribution to history; it must also 
contain the pleasure of being, as in his performance piece 
The Smiling Workman, i960 (figs. 1, 37-39), in which he 
declares, "I love what I'm doing." 

Inside the Gaze 

Moving back and forth between tradition and innovation, 
and interpreting them in his own way, Dine from the start 
creates his own bridge to the present, not a dream or 
chimera, but as a reality, however initially untouchable and 
unattainable. In 1959-60 he paints Black Rainbow (fog. 59), 
a kind of apparition that is simultaneously outside of time 
and in the present. The intention is to identify and trace 
an apparition that is a sign of passage between two poles: 



movement in history and in ones own being. This 
combination of extremes, however, is also a transcendence 

of the ideal notion of an art detached from realitj through 
reversion to the past and acknowledgment of tradition. 
and a movement toward an art that defines a reality 
connected to life. 

Dines uncondition.il, passionate connection to what art 
and the artist are about is openly affirmed in Tht Smili 
Workman, staged at the Judson Gallery (as part of the \Li\ 
Gun S/h.x program of 1 lappenings), and in (../;• Crash at the 
Reuben Gallery, later in i960 (figs. 12, 13, 44—46). In both 
performances, the subject is the artist himself; thus, their 
symbolic representation should be seen as self-analysis. In 
The Smiling Workman, the artist is shown performing a job — 
that of painting to create happiness — while Car Crash 
presents a state of mind concerning the conjunction of life 
and death, past and future. The former is concerned with 
making a pleasurable future for oneself, and the latter with 
the need for a redemption from pain and sorrow, from 
memory and remembrance. Both are fateful situations, in 
that they point to the path to be taken, come what may, by 
the person who chooses to be an artist. 

In Dine, the movement from art to the self is manifested in 
the notion of transport and transferral of psychic impulses 
and emotions, of feelings and behavior patterns, object 
relations and libidinal charges made explicit in the object. 
These are not its vehicle a priori, but are recognizable as such 
a posteriori, as the reincarnation of an existence that passes 
through objects. Thus, Green Suit, in which the libidinal, 
sexual charge is transferred onto the object, grazes the 
consciousness as the penis bulges from the pants. Here, art 
serves as catalytic ferment, with the clothing-being 
functioning both visually and theatrically, awakening our 
senses by highlighting singularity and strangeness. In Green 
Suit, the shift from self to painting is made manifest by their 
coinciding in a single object. The same shift is repeated in 
The Smiling Workman, where the artist immerses himself in 
the pleasures of color and paint, seminal matter that enables 
him to be reborn to another life, the happy or at least 
laughing, ironic life of the artist working and nourishing 
himself on painting, drinking it up. This aesthetic- 
psychological interpretation of the creative transfer between 
object and art, history and memory, emotion and body, is a 
movement toward an identity that can be conceived in 
different ways: for example, as subject in Green Suit and The 
Smiling Workman, or as memory in Untitled (Winged Victory 1 
and Car Crash. 

In all these works, a constant presence is conveyed by the 
clothing that passes from sculpture to painting in order 
finally to cover the body of the artist. And if we consider that 
clothing confers on the human being his anthropological and 
social identity — his very being — its prominence in Dines 
work becomes fundamental to an understanding of his 
journey as an individual and artist. Being presented in 
sculpture and painting, it may acquire, as priestly robes do in 
the Old Testament, a sense of magnificence and honor, of 
something weighty and important befitting the status of the 
"priest" who performs the artistic rite. It is a solemn 
vestment dressing his body, a covering and a service to God. 
in the same sense that God himself "clothed" the world with 
the work of his Creation — as reflected in the magnificence of 
the kabod of Jahweh and, in turn, the magnificence of the 
sacerdotal vestment. 4 The use of clothing in Dines 
assemblage Untitled (Tht Winged Victory) is essentially 
transcendent; the clothing refers to the divine power 
underlying an image of glory. 



&gt;7 



Dine also deals with a completely different aspect of 
clothing's metaphysical significance — the relationship 
between clothing and the naked body — in numerous works, 
beginning with Green Suit. For him, as for the Greeks, nudity 
is not something shameful, ridiculous, or dishonorable, but 
rather a symbol of the naked truth. Moreover, his green 
corduroy suit, aside from revealing the protuberant sex of its 
wearer (the artist himself ), is also dressed with color. Thus, 
for him, painting is also an instrument of truth on which the 
entire process of knowledge is based. The gaze and vision of 
art pass through all clothing, all wrappings, all garments, to 
arrive at naked reality. 

The poles of clothing and nakedness mark Dines entire 
itinerary to the present day, to the point that his painting 
from time to time seems to focus on one to the exclusion 
of the other. In the works from before 1969, the metaphysics 
of clothing intersects with the metaphysics of the nude, or of 
some detail of the body, as a juxtaposition of dignity and 
freedom: on the one hand, the theme of clothing as human 
attribute, as in Nancy's Tie, i960 (fig. 65), Shoe , 1961 (fig. 77), 
Red Suspenders, 1961 (fig. 70), Three-Panel Study for a Child's 
Room, 1961 (fig. 107), White Suit {Self -Portrait), 1964 (fig. 125), 
Red Robe with Hatchet {Self-Portrait) , 1964 (fig. 128); and, on 
the other, the removal of the veils and wrappings from the 
body, merging the gaze and the nude on the same visual 
plane, as in Hair, 196 1 (fig. 66), Blonde Hair (fig. 67), 196 1, 
and a number of works beyond the scope of this book, 
including Hair, 1970, The Cellist, 1975, Self-Portrait in Vermont, 
1979, Venus, 1981, and Twisted Torso of a Youth (Illioneus, ca. 
300 B.C.), 1989. 

In the performance pieces that Dine created and staged 
in New York in i960, the passage between body and clothing 
is constant. Dine appears in these with his face made up, 
always dressed — in The Smiling Workman, in a smock covered 
with traces of red paint; in Vaudeville Collage (figs. 40—42), 
decked out as a cabaret performer; in Car Crash, wrapped 
in a silver, almost spacesuit-like jumpsuit; in A Shining 
Bed (figs. 51 — 53), disguised as Santa Claus. But in these 
rites, also called Happenings — a term conveying a sense 
of "portentous" occurrences — the clothing has a deeper 
significance: that of a "clothed" reality (typical of an art that 
covers surfaces and reveals a message), which can be seen in 
all its magnificence by only a few initiates. In The Smiling 
Workman, clothing is an instrument for glorifying the gesture 
of the artist who paints and enters the canvas, covering 
himself, like a workman, with sweat and splotches of color; 
in Vaudeville Collage, he manages to include, in his vaudeville- 
like curtain, unusual elements such as rags and vegetables, 
and to cover a dual personality, half-male, half-female; in Car 
Crash, he plays the spacesuited acrobat, full of memories and 
stories of traffic accidents from which he liberates himself 
cathartically through narrative and drawing; and in A Shining 
Bed, stretched out on a bed and dressed up as a Nativity 
character, he carries out the "birth" of a new world. 

These performances express the magnificence of the visible 
as much as they refer to the invisible, the hidden things that 
grow inside all the actors of a creative scene. Each of Dines 
performance pieces rests on a tension between an amorphous, 
chance occurrence and an image evoked by a form or color. 
They imply a seeing and a non-seeing, a conscious and an 
unconscious condition, a figuration underlying a non-figure 
—a game between known and unknown that combines the 
blinding light of the stage with the deep shadow of the hidden 
meanings of a story between the personal and the public. 

All of Dines work hinges on this transition between visible 
and invisible, between clothing and clothed. Each painting 



or sculpture covertly designates something difficult to name 
yet clearly present and indicated: the artist's face lurking 
behind the object, turning its eyes to the audience, its users. 
If we accept this "inside-out" vision, Dines art reveals itself 
to be as much a shutting out as an unveiling, keeping 
something hidden or veiled behind what is visible at the 
moment where the accident gives way to emotion and 
macabre memory — as in Car Crash — or where the body 
gives way to the suit or the bathrobe. 

The works dealing with the body and nakedness move in 
the opposite direction. They tend to unveil, to clarify and 
illuminate inferiority, which actually becomes concretized in 
the form of a heart in Nancy and I at Ithaca {Straw Heart), 
1966 — 69 (fig. 151). In between are the works based on a 
coupling of antithetical, complementary elements, those 
representing object and body, thing and gesture, in an 
ambiguous, twofold manner, where there is no more male or 
female, no idealized image or specific gender, but all 
converging toward a total representation of being as an 
instrument at once divine and human, erotic and functional, 
active and passive. I am referring to the Tool paintings, in 
which the tools can be considered a threshold between the 
realities of clothing and body. They are an essential, absolute 
truth: they are aspect and image, mask and body, mobility 
and immobility, identity and instrument, life and death. 

They move in an intermediate space between clothing and 
the body, granting the second skin — the clothing — an 
objectual dimension equal in importance to the body, which 
here, by means of the hand or some other limb, becomes a 
support. The tools are veiled bodies, bodied veils; they 
combine extremes. They continue to be manifestations of 
human and divine creativity, thus revealing a higher essence. 
At the same time they are bare, naked entities that are one 
with the body, are part of it and extend its sensoriality and 
sensuality. The tools are thus simulacra of something that is 
at once present and absent. They therefore not only represent 
the object of consumption — an interpretation that has long 
distorted all of Dine's work by categorizing it as Pop art — 
but are a redemption of the object between being and non- 
being, conscious and unconscious, and echo the presence of 
an invisible substratum that is both erotic and spiritual, and 
unfolds from Green Suit onward. 

In the end, the tools can be situated in a mimetic 
dimension, as the remains and phantasms of a body that is 
elsewhere: an extraneous clothing or corporeality that 
resembles the artist's identity. Indeed, Dine has always 
stressed the correspondence between his tools and his life 
experience. If we accept this concordance between tool and 
(artist's) identity, we will also understand Dine's reappraisal 
of nude statuary — the sculptural and painterly nude of 
traditional, academic culture — in his 1981 Venus. It was 
certainly not his intention (and this led him into exile and 
isolation) to enter into an avant-garde conception of art, 
which at the time was identified with Pop art, was opposed 
to corporeal anatomy, and strove to break free from all 
models that might lead to a Romantic vision or to classical 
or modern statuary. "I think the biggest inaccuracies that 
have been written about me have to do with Pop art and 
my relationship to it," Dine has pointed out. "There's been 
no real understanding of my strange voyage in art. My 
work had such a handmade look about it next to these 
manufactured images. I have always felt closer to those 
Europeans like Giacometti, Morandi, Balthus, Magritte — 
not stylistically, but those were careers that I thought were 
exemplary in art.'" 1 

What interests him is the passage between clothing and 



18 



the hotly, understood in the ultimate sense, however, as an 
exchange value between two realities. This is what underlies 
his erotic use of drapery in his 1981 Venus, whose peplos 
actually covers only her hips, leaving her torso and breasts 
naked; or his use of the bathrobe as a living remnant. In 
Dine's Bathrobes in particular, the artist's body has undergone 
a transformation emancipating it from the human figure by 
becoming dissolved in the fabric, as the body of Saint 
Theresa has in Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini's The Ecstasy of Saint 
Theresa, 1645-52. Making minor concessions to the passage, 
the bathrobe is the transition between the body and the 
object, between identity and clothing; it embodies the total 
dislocation of what lies beneath. 

The object-remnant replaces the artist's body, even while 
conveying its subjectivity. As Dine has said, "There's no 
difference between shower heads and axes and hammers; 
they're all metaphorical, obvious stand-ins for human 
things." 6 He is present in "flesh and blood," not through his 
own corporeality but through a mediated corporeality, that 
of the thing representing him. The choice and inclusion of a 
shower head, a necklace, a bathroom fixture, or a knife thus 
becomes a kind of cloning at the limits of the biological and 
the mechanical. The choice of a thing as a replica of the self, 
forming a psychophysical "twin," represents a doubling that 
makes transparent the artist's desire to pass from first- 
personhood to the otherness of his own being- in-time, a 
transition from the ego to its shadow. 

Dine explores the motif of the symmetrical double in Two 
Sists, i960 (fig. 56), and in Teeth, 1960 — 61 (fig. 76), in both of 
which the composition consists of a form juxtaposed with its 
mirror image. The symmetrical sameness of the paired forms 
echoes the analogy between art and artificer, work and 
workman, vaudeville and actor, dream and dreamer, which 
Dine has been cultivating to this point, reinforcing the 
mimetic character of his visual poetics, which vacillates 
between a primary image and its shadow. One example of 
this dialectic between object and reflected image can be 
found in Black Bathroom #2, 1962 (see fig. 97), which the 
artist considers a "life drawing." The object is, in fact, 
surrounded by black, which is not a natural color but only 
a mental one; the object is thus transformed into a concept, 
becoming an unnatural "relief." In this phase the object 
quits the system of relationships and traditional proportions; 
it slips outside of space and off the stage, no longer 
subordinating itself to the spatial order of temporal and 
historical perspective; ceasing to have a value or function, 
it acquires the relationlessness of matter and chance. In this 
state, the object or thing is transformed into something 
utterly new and different, and here lies Dine's great 
perception: it presents itself as a being-in-itself replacing 
being-in-space and being-in-nature. His painting conveys 
the consciousness of a total otherness of the object and 
reality, which exists in the impossibility of a relationship. 

Compared to the objects of Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, 
Oldenburg and Arman, George Segal and Daniel Spoerri, 
Dine's objects do not change or interpenetrate one another, 
they are not absorbed or cut, contextualized or altered; 
rather, they exist in an absolute state, just as they are. In this 
sense, the presence of shadow, which will find its reflection 
in the presence of light, is a further confirmation of their 
autonomous identity. It is part of their personality, their 
"dark side" — which is also their relationship to painting, 
as in Red Knife, 1962 (fig. 82), and to representation. Indeed, 
shadow even comes to assume the form of the drawing — that 
is, the contour defining the object — -in, for example, The 
Toaster, 1962 (fig. 100). 



To recapitulate what we have been saying, one primarj 
significance that can be attributed to the object Dine 
introduces in his paintings is that it cannot be considered 
merely an industrial product evoking mass society and 
popular culture that lead indifferently to Pop and Minimal 
art. Rather, it must be assumed as a part and function of 
his life. In a transcendent dimension that can range from 
the commonest thing to ancient statuary. Dines object 
crystallizes the form of a dialectic between const lousness 
and the unconscious; it is thus a fundamental structure of 
the eternal dialogue characterizing human nature. In this 
respect, one can understand why, on the level of painterly 
language, Dine maintains an Abstract Expressionist 
relationship with the object: "I don't believe there was a 
sharp break and this [Pop art] is replacing Abstract 
Expressionism. Pop art is only a facet of my work. More than 
popular images I'm interested in personal images. ... I tie 
myself to Abstract Expressionism like fathers and sons.'" 

His painterly application and technique continually echo 
the gestural quality of Art Informel, the color applied in a 
way that appears similar with the techniques of Willem 
de Kooning and Jean Dubuffet. In fact, his intention is to 
immerse the object in a purification of force and material 
action that echoes the human presence, its body and activity 
— for example, in A Tie in a Red Landscape, 1961 (fig. 69). 
Even if he attempts to stem its advance — as perhaps he does 
in Hair, i960 — the Expressionist heritage helps him to keep 
alive an organic dimension in painting, where the artist's 
corporeality and individual identity continue to exist. He 
is aware that by citing the object as a path of mediation for 
his existence as a person and an artist, he runs the risk of 
entering an inhuman dimension; and this is why he revives 
the agitated, gestural brushstroke of Abstract Expressionism. 

The polarity of Pop art and Abstract Expressionism 
continuously creates another bridge between equivalents and 
complements; his operative and linguistic method is based 
on transition, which is the foundation of his artistic identity. 
Dine believes that art is a locus of relativization between 
subjects and objects, where the artist's responsibility is to 
take charge of both, and to make something at once personal 
and impersonal, positive and negative, feminine and 
masculine, conscious and unconscious, so that each entity 
will carry its own shadow behind it. 

Among the shadows of objects falls their naming. Thus, to 
pose to oneself the question of the shadow is also to assume 
the meaning of the nominal destiny of a thing. We are no 
longer dealing with a projection, but with an amplification. 
Alongside the maximum intensity of reality and its double, 
which may assume both material and immaterial forms, 
stands the nominal doubling that broadens meaning and 
opens up new areas previously lacking in the analysis of the 
work. Yet, unlike the confusion Magritte introduces between 
the thing and its name — a confusion linked to Dada and 
Surrealist transgression — Dine goes back to establishing a 
clear equivalence between same and same. No imaginary or 
erroneous solution, nor a search for dissonance or disturbing 
extraneousness. The image of the shoe is accompanied by the 
word "shoe"; the necklace bears the label "pearls," as if he 
had no intention of saving the object from its banality. Dine 
does not enter into imaginary or symbolic realms, nor does 
he return to the displacement that in Duchamp, Magritte, 
Francis Picabia, and Breton sustained the manipulative, 
sublimating relationship between subject and object. He has 
no interest in the discordance between the idea of something 
and its appearance, or in a senseless relationship with things 
that would deny the prosaic reality of the object in favor of 



some personal mirage or dream thereof. He is not in search 
of another universe; he wants only to be wholly present in his 
universe — to speak and be spoken to by the things he 
chooses and creates. But these need not necessarily be 
projected onto an incongruous meaning that distorts or 
negates the thing's existence as simply what it is. In Dines 
universe, a shoe remains just a shoe, and a necklace is just a 
string of pearls. 

The artist manifests himself, the thing manifests itself, and 
both constitute themselves at once as subject and object. The 
one is the other's shadow, and the one illuminates the other. 
Light, in Dines work, serves to emphasize a thing's realness, 
which, although it may seem to fluctuate in real life, never 
turns into the imaginary or the dream. The light is intense, 
but not too much so, so as not to dispel the shadow. It is 
trained only on the object, allowing it to be accepted for 
what it is, without any slippage of meaning. In Child's Blue 
Wall (fig. 108) and Flesh Bathroom with Yellow Light and 
Objects (fig. 102), both 1962, the explicit light falls straight 
on the subject of the painting. Its truth hinders the 
functioning of the imaginary. It declares the urgency of not 
creating any hidden meanings, but rather of focusing one's 
attention on what is before one's eyes — as in Green Shower, 
1962 (fig. 101), which presents to us a metallic simulacrum of 
rain, and White Suit (Self -Portrait), in which the suit evokes a 
trace of the person who had worn it (the artist himself). 
No inner reflection is required. As in Caravaggio and 
Morandi, the lighting reinforces a state of non-imagination, 
a representation of the real. The picture is an object, its 
presence is another, and both participate in the same reality. 
They are interchangeable, and are apprehended by their 
placement in light. 

Working on the threshold between complementary poles, 
Dine seems to move in the interstices between object and 
subject, but inevitably he manages as well to create a passage 
between object and painting, painting and tool, vision and 
display. Moving in the undefined territory between interior 
and exterior, personal and impersonal, wish-fantasy and 
objective reality, he continually slips into the marginal 
area of pure transition between things. On the opaque 
surface of the painting, one thus encounters realities of 
meaning and meaninglessness: objects that continue to have 
a function, such as light bulbs, and elements of simulation 
and substitution, such as the bathrobe. Dine thus manages 
to confuse the principle of reality with the identity of the 
subject reflected in it. In this sense, the objects are swallowed 
up by one another, in the plausibility of meaningless meaning. 
However, once again, the conjunction between things occurs 
not only on the surface — as in Duchamp's Large Glass, 1915-23 
— but is truly and concretely embedded in them. No longer 
the anachronistic trompe l'oeil, which is mere appearance, 
but the objective reality of an axe embedded in the frame of 
a window made opaque by color, as in Window with an Axe, 
1961-62 (fig. 93); or a metal rod extending from a table and 
entering the painting, as in Vise, 1962 (fig. 95); or a stovepipe 
that unites and connects two paintings like an umbilical 
cord, as in Dream #2, 1963 (see fig. 123). 

And since the everyday object absorbs the subject as much 
as the painting, both painting and subject can incorporate 
the object. In many paintings, the objects are seduced by the 
color and absorbed into the painting's surface, to the point 
where they become, as it were, "visual sounds," intimate and 
familiar, components of a childlike, personal universe, as in 
Child's Blue Wall. They emerge and disappear as though 
swept away by a current of memories and emotions. They 
shimmer on the white or black page, like figures of a 



potential narrative based on their randomly determined 
development as objects or as shadows, for example in Colorful 
Hammering (fig. 91) and Summer Tools (fig. 92), both 1962. 
But most surprisingly, they transform themselves into an 
illumination of the everyday, a touching participation in the 
immediacy of life. Everyday life appears and enters Dines 
art. It finds an ambiguous grandeur in the fusion of painting 
and furniture. It is nourished by a double that erases 
boundaries and widens reciprocal margins. In Four Rooms, 
1962 (fig. 109), turning the mutual absorption of objects and 
paintings into a spectacle actually creates an environment — 
a place of implosion between painting and sculpture, 
furniture and art. The result is a critical mass offerees that, 
as had previously occurred in The House and its domestic 
display, calls into question a field of intimate energy in 
which is enacted the transition between life and death, 
personal and impersonal, painting and object, compatibility 
and heterogeneity, reality and illusion. We are once again in 
search of a further equivalence between being and appearing, 
true and false, ego and world. Dine, the subject, grasps 
himself as otherness and uses art to reflect himself in it. 

The Space of Intimacy 

Intimacy, according to Heidegger, holds opposites together. 
It designates a condition whereby distant, contrary forces 
nevertheless unite and join. More than inferiority, it qualifies 
not only experience but a way of seeing and combining 
things, one that is based on dialogue — that is, on a 
contradictory feeling that is a combination of adherence and 
uneasiness, of acceptance and perplexity. Intimacy makes it 
possible it go back and forth between one pole and the other; 
it establishes a movement among things, which thereby 
manage to belong to one another. Through the intimacy of 
himself and his world, made up of objects and paintings, 
Dine manages to create an art that fills the intervals between 
opposites, linking and balancing them. Just as Dine's 
rainbow and his suit, the light and the shadow, establish a 
connection between being and non-being, subject and thing, 
and thus manage to generate an intimate dialogue, some of 
his motifs link subjective, personal, individual experience 
with the outside. In these works, the art presupposes the 
existence of a partner (the viewer) who, consciously or 
unconsciously, will let him/herself become involved with or 
will abandon him/herself to the pleasure of objects. 

In the 1962 Bathroom series, the artist's act of reflection 
moves into an intimate realm: the extremely subjective 
condition of domestic living. Dine cuts out portions of this 
aspect of life and makes them visually penetrable. He 
prepares a surface and incorporates in it various components 
of this intimate realm, such as toothbrushes, toilet paper, 
shower fixture, soap dish, towels, and mirrored cabinet. In 
certain works, the mirrored cabinet is placed at the extreme 
edge of the canvas, where it functions as a frame ready to 
hold the portrait of the person in front of it (and reflected 
there), like a visual womb. The choice of a space of personal 
existence as a physical extension of art transforms these 
works into a place in which the artist himself moves and 
lives. They are thus existential territories that should be 
perceived with all the senses, or at least through all the 
sensory modalities. Like Four Rooms, they participate in a 
multisensory dimension that conceives of art as something to 
be lived, not just admired. 

Naturally the territory of intimacy and everyday life can be 
divided up into the different types of spaces connected to 
specific individual functions and sensory units. Focusing on 
the bathroom thus implies placing one's attention on the self 



.'11 



as a reflection of an inner and outer corporeality — on a 
subject at once limpid and obscure, tactile and visual. 
Included here are the tools of seeing oneself and defining 
oneself, the tools of touching and cleaning oneself, all the 
metaphors of an intimate, conscious and intense life. Let us 
look at a few. 

First, the light. In Flesh Bathroom with Yellow Light and 
Objects, a light bulb illuminates the painting's fleshlike 
surface as well as the skin of the objects, including the 
toothbrush. A Bathroom St inly (fig. 98) and The Pink Bathroom 
(fig. 104) deal with inner physicality, still entirely within the 
amniotic fluid of color, which makes the objects float in a 
universe of visual intensity. The chromatic splendor is food 
for the eyes and the senses; it purifies and makes the artist's 
"bite" shine. In Small Shower #2 (f\£. no), the light is 
dispersed in a spray of water. In those works where Dine has 
placed a mirrored cabinet on the surface of the painting — 
including Double Red Bathroom (fig. 96), Flesh Bathroom with 
Yellow Light and Objects, Black Bathroom (fig. 103), The Pink 
Bathroom, and Whitt Bathroom (f\^. 105) — the mirror, in a 
tradition that runs from Jan Van Eyck's Giovanni Amolfini 
and His Bride, [434, to several versions ofVenus's Toilette by- 
various artists of the School of Fontainebleau, underscores 
the idea of an infinite space that begins in an enclosed, 
private room, descends into the smallest microcosm, and 
expands out to the macrocosm. Here, the mirror is not two- 
dimensional but three-dimensional; it belongs to the family 
of real, concrete things that occupy our everyday life and 
experience. It is a functioning object as well as a declaration 
of a space that opens up, to the point of absorbing in its 
reflections the artist, the viewers, and the surrounding 
context. If one considers the artist himself as the primary 
subject, it may be considered a potential expansion of his 
universe, the foregrounding of a double that is ever-changing. 
Its function as reflection also guides the logic of the painting, 
where what occurs on the painted surface is the double, or 
the "portrait" of the artist himself, who does not reveal 
himself completely, but leaves an inner space hidden, that of 
his cabinet. From the point of view of the observer, the 
mirrored cabinet is an object that multiplies one's capacity 
for seeing, which Dines art confirms, and a multiplication of 
oneself and others. In fact, to place oneself before the mirror 
is to scrutinize oneself and the surrounding context, to see 
oneself narcissistically and historically. When one steps away 
from the mirror, one surveys the world, entering a completely 
existential dimension. All these themes are present in Dine's 
Bathrooms. As we have seen, his work has a breadth that 
exalts the magnificence of still lifes, while in the figure of the 
mirror he tends, as in ancient art, to "renew that idea of 
continuity between the painted space and the existential 
space which since the beginning of the fourteenth century 
had been a primary requirement of serious painting." 8 

The use of the mirror is a renewal of the question, "Who 
am I?" which the artist is continually asking in his painting, 
and the painting answers back, "You are your history." The 
need to continue the journey of self-discovery and self- 
narration through the mutual involvement of subject and 
object has its roots in the memory of things and in the drives 
and energies that come to the artist from the language of art. 
Dine sees himself projected in the mirror without being 
swallowed up by it. He confronts the inventory of lus beloved 
things, such as the tools he used and admired in childhood 
in his family's hardware stores; but more than anything else, 
he demands a guarantee for his journey into the mirroring of 
a presence in the world as human being and as artist, into 
the tools of making and modifying, of tracing and painting. 



In these tools — from the hammer to the paintbrush, the 
palette to the color chart — he finds the complete specular 
reciprocity that he needs to underscore the personal as well 
as social and communicative meaning that his delving into 
and reflecting on himself has brought to light. He brings 
into focus the conceptual as will as emotional labor of 
his otherness. It is a persistently autobiographical, and 
temporal, movement among objects. Since 1960-61, Dine 
has been incorporating into his works, alongside tools 
such as the hammer — as in The Hammer Acts (fig. 88) and 
A Hammer Study (fig. 90), both 1962 — motifs related to his 
life as an artist: the palette and the color chart. The first 
such work, A 193s Palett, i960, (fig. 26), is a declaration of 
self-legitimation as an artist, which he conveys by equating 
the value of the palette with that of his own twenty-five-year 
existence. In subsequent works, his palette of colors is 
presented not only as the traditional wooden artist's palette 
but also as a house painter's color chart, a coldly organized 
keyboard ready for his visual concert. The first of these, 
A Universal Color Chart, 1961 (fig. 78), contains impasti and 
clots of material that underscore a physical and fleshly 
complexity, but Dine has eliminated the traces of such 
human touch in A Color Chart, 196? (fig. 121), where the grid 
of colored rectangles represents the intellectual and rational 
potential of art, as opposed to its viscerality and drama. At 
times, though, the two approaches intertwine and overlap 
somewhat, as if to demonstrate that their union is a preamble 
to the more complex discourse of figuration and narrative, as 
in the hint of landscape in Red Devil Color Chart No. Tiro, 
1963 (fig. 122). 

The palette presents a further duality, casting an inward 
gaze on history and art, and an outward gaze on the present 
and on creation. In Two Palettes (International Congress &lt;&gt;/ 
Construct ivnts and Dadaists, 1922) #/ and #2, both 1963 
(figs. 119, 120), the palettes burst into a multitude of 
fragments of figures, signs, forms, and colors that refer back 
to art's cultural and visual heritage. In Hatchet with 'inn 
Palettes, State No. 2, 1963, a wood plank the same length as the 
canvas is superimposed on the surface of the palette, and 
embedded in the plank is an axe, whose shadowy reflections 
project different densities of black onto the background. 
Here the dualism of the artist as distributor of objects and 
shadows reaches the height of its declaration of identity. The 
artist-palette moves between the poles of reality and 
representation, material and immaterial, introversion and 
extroversion, dualities that are reflected in the painting's 
division into two parts by the plank, and in such pairings as 
paintbrush and hatchet, palette and color, which mirror one 
another or are each other's shadow. 

Another element that Dine uses repeatedly is the &lt; ham. 
often in combination with wire, string, stovepipe, or pulley, 
m works ranging from Sickle, 1962 (tig. 83), to Isometric Self- 
Portrait, 1964 (fig. mo). The chain sustains and individuates .1 
relationship between the object and the painting. It functions 
as either an umbilical cord uniting two wombs, or as an 
energy channel connecting them and bearing witness to their 
complexity as opposites. As an energy flow, it highlights 
their linearity or transversahtv, acting .is a raj of iih ulental 
light thai puts objects and paintings on the same plane, 
wink- respecting their autonomy and territoriality. Whether 
it tunc t ions as a placenta or a more- general con nee tive is 
determined by where Dine places the chain, wire, or cord in 
relation to the suit or the bathrobe, metaphors oi the artist 
in his role as public or private person, re spec tively. When 
n is atta&lt; hed at the center ot the suit or bathrobe - i.e., 
the artist's abdomen — it is a placenta through which the 



dialogue between the artist and things is transmitted. 
Dine uses this configuration in White Suit #2 (Self-Portrait) 
(fig. 126) and in Palette (Self-Portrait No. 1) (fig. 127), both 
1964, but it attains its richest manifestation in Red Robe #2, 
1964 (fig. 132), where the chain is part of a nexus of interlocking 
motifs, including the outlines of a chair, a bathrobe, and an 
axe, as well as an actual red penknife and a stick painted red, 
all against a red ground. It is difficult to establish a sequence 
for these motifs: if one starts from the center, with the 
bathrobe and the chair — in other words, human body and 
thing, one within the other — one notices a variety of 
different radiating elements. The chain supports, at its ends, 
the penknife and the stick, behind which Dine has painted 
"shadows" — a geometric one behind the knife, and a more 
organic one behind the stick. In the lower section of the 
canvas, seven straight lines radiate symmetrically down to 
the bottom from the midpoint of the diameter of a 
semicircle, while the bathrobe seems to float above them. 
Any interpretation of this would be complex, but in its full 
articulation it confirms Dines dialectical premise: the 
ongoing quest to find, for art, an intermediate ground 
between action and behavior, being and appearance, male 
and female, memory and present time. 

In his essentialism, Dine seeks a balance — from right to 
left, top to bottom — between historical vision and 
contemporary vision, quasi-mathematical perception and 
organic sensation, abstraction and figuration. He is always 
attentive to the interior of things, to the duality of being — 
to that which proceeds by chance and that which can be 
controlled, that which is governed by reason and that 
which allows for sensuality. In the extreme cases of Two 
Palettes in Black and Stovepipe (The Dream) (fig. 114) and 
Dream #2, both 1963, the loving communication between 
the parts occurs through the extension of a stovepipe 
connecting two paintings, one of which features two palettes. 
Here the passage from one thing to another covers the 
distance between them, fills up the space, and confronts 
every difficulty that might prevent a connection ensuring 
the circulation of energy between the two parts — thus 
bringing together day and night, waking and sleeping, 
nightmare and dream. 

Amid these paradigms of the double, the bathrobe, along 
with the suit, reappears, soon to be followed — starting with 
the sculptures that he made in 1965 — by boots (see figs. 113, 
137), the shoe, the glove, the hat, and an envelope. Like the 
mirrored cabinet, the bathrobe suggests a hidden content as 
much as a self-portrait: "It was a way to make a self- 
portrait," said Dine, "but I didn't have the nerve to do it just 
[that way] — or didn't want to do it just that way — and I 
didn't look like I was inside of it. But no longer."'' The 
bathrobe, like the suit, presents an umbilical center that 
generates rays and figures related to a person's anatomy, 
covering his private parts — his sex and muscles, nerves and 
heart. It functions as armor and as a form of enclosure that 
keeps him from wandering. It is a corset that supports him 
and a prison that suffocates him, a surface that envelops him 
and shelters the raw truth but also hides and denies it. 
Intertwined on top of it are colors and figures, decorations 
and motifs that speak of the tastes and culture, the history 
and interests of the person that wears it. It is a second skin 
that is never hermetically closed; from Green Suit to Red Robe 
with Hatchet (Self-Portrait) , it always admits, or threatens, 
the possibility of a sexual apparition or physical revelation. 
Indeed, as motifs that Dine uses in connection with self- 
revelation and self-exposure, the suit and the bathrobe 
foreshadow a complete stripping, or an amorous communication 



of the sort linked to affairs of the heart. This is probably 
self-evident for the bathrobe; but the suit, too, implies both 
closing and opening, since the buttons and belt are ornaments 
that function as implements for fastening and unfastening a 
garment. The buttons, when fastened, hold two separate 
parts together — the left and right parts of the body, as well 
as its visible and hidden parts. Color and technique also play 
a part in the motif's dual or multiple signification: White 
Suit (Self-Portrait) juxtaposes black and white, and combines 
drawing and painting, as if to embody this multiplicity. Dine 
extends this idea further in works where he moves back and 
forth between two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality, 
between painting and sculpture, working in a halfway state 
that is further reinforced by the dualities of lightness and 
weight, raw and worked material, naturalness and artificiality, 
color and black-and-white, order and disorder — and leads 
him to superimpose the image of the bathrobe on the image 
of the palette in Palette (Self-Portrait No. 1), and to present 
a drawing of a bathrobe next to a painted color chart in Self- 
Portrait Next to a Colored Window, 1964 (fig. 131). 

The bathrobe is also related to the psychoanalytic treatment 
Dine underwent from 1962 to 1966. IO It becomes the image of 
a lost covering, the rediscovered placenta, which closes the 
two sides of scars, and through which the artist gets close to 
the womb of his desires. It opens and closes a barrier to those 
desires, and serves to cover and protect his body. In the 
segment of chain or wire that unites the various aspects of 
the self lies the unity Dine continuously asserts: the strong 
social and aesthetic correspondence between dressing and 
painting. One might even go so far as to say that the artist 
and the fashion designer — with their similar cutting and 
shaping of materials and selection and juxtaposition of 
colors — both dress and bedeck the world." 

Every time Dine claims a painting as a self-portrait, he 
deliberately draws attention to himself as its author and 
invites observers to consider the communicative significance 
his analytic probing bears because it unfolds with and for the 
other, in an overlapping interchange of recognitions in which 
reality and the naked truth show each other the way, 
combining maximum singularity with maximum 
universality. With respect to introspection and otherness, 
artistic mirroring constitutes a third way, for, on the one 
hand, it prevents one from seeing without there being an 
object of one's sight, and, on the other, it prevents the object 
from being reified and deceptively surrendered to the 
inquiries of its investigator. As a third way, art is at first a 
frontal image on which all eyes converge to find a center that 
might be sexuality or identity, dream or desire. Later, when 
the visual therapy manages to capture, between the bathrobe 
and the palette, the figure of the self and its individuality, 
the art increasingly flows in the direction of the object, 
becomes itself sculpture and thing. The mirror as surface 
reflecting imaginary figures then turns into a transmitter 
outwardly projecting masses of materials and figures, which 
metaphorically are still descended from the double and the 
threshold, the reflection and the passage. 

Starting in 1964, Dine renewed his project of self-portraiture 
through the use of certain parts of his own artistic "body," 
especially the tools and the bathrobe, beginning with the 
mixed-media assemblage Stephen Hands Path, 1964/98 
(fig. 134). This juxtaposition of a sculpture (a wooden sawhorse 
supporting a log embedded with two axes) and a painting (of 
the right half of a bathrobe, oriented horizontally) represents 
a combination of seeing and acting, of image and object. The 
discharge of energy unleashed between these poles anticipates 
and leads to the motifs of mirroring and crossing between

different realms in Dines freestanding sculptures. In Doublt 
Hammer Doorway (fig. 143) and A Boot Bench Ochre #2 (fig. 113), 
both 1965, the questioning of the object and of its usual 
function in a real-life context, and in relation to the hotly, 
unfolds to form a whole that contains the entirety of Dines 
various themes. In these and other of his sculptures, objective 
reality and subjective experience are merged in the formation 
of a hybrid object that blurs the lines between useful and 
useless, normal and abnormal, with a logic traceable to the 
interstices of difference between verisimilitude and truth. 

To grasp the meaning of these sculptures, which continue 
the dualism of Dines approach, one must bear in mind that 
the identification of the self through the use of opposites has 
the inevitable result of poeticizing the environment, as it had 
in The House and The Smiling Workman and has continued to 
have in his works since then. This means that the aleatory 
play between art and things, by 1965, finds a correspondence 
between objects and traditional sculpture. In this sense, the 
technique of casting should be seen as the reassertion of a 
method that, even with its connections to Giacometti, was 
not regarded very favorably within the avant-garde movements 
that run from Dada to Pop art. 

Another aspect by which the object demands to be 
recognized is its sexual connotation — that is, its identity as a 
fetish and an emblematic expression of a desire. Dines hybrid 
forms embody an absence essential to understanding the 
origins of a development that began erotically with the 1959 
works Altar for Jeremiah and Green Suit and by the mid-1960s 
reached the point of feeding a desire for the other, in both 
the psychological and physical, intellectual and sensual 
senses. In sculptures such as Summer Table (fig. 145) and 
Summer Torso, both 1965, the distances between male and 
female disappear, and objects appear as aspects of a 
generalized scene of desire. These objects become sensual 
and sexual vehicles, setting in motion a concatenation of 
fantasies in which the conveyance of love reigns supreme. 

At this point the eroticism of clothing, with its attraction 
of a second skin, can make way for the triumphant innocence 
of an intimacy that openly declares and reveals itself. As 
Dine has said, "The unleashing of inner thoughts in an 
exciting way, in an appropriate way, is never a problem. I love 
exposure." 12 One is liberated from the wrapping and passes 
directly to the contents, to what lies beneath the surface, 
both anatomically and sexually. The iconographic celebration 
of Nancy and I at Ithaca (Green) (fig. 150) and Nancy and I at 
Ithaca {Straw Heart) (fig. 151), both 1966 — 69, aside from 
recalling the odyssey of Ulysses the voyager and seeker, also 
communicates Dines goal of revealing his inner self as an 
artist and a person. From this moment on, he sets about 
opening his heart, declaring his union with art, no longer 
as covering and analysis, but as the splendor of an ancient 
yet contemporary language. Before moving on to this 
neoclassical, or better yet, neocontemporary phase — in the 
sense that it conveys history into the present and the present 
into history — -he completes a definitive journey inside his 
persona] universe. In Name Painting #/, 1968-69 (fig. 155), and 
its sequel Name Painting #-\ 1969, he records the names, and 
thus the embodiments, of everyone he has known or met. 
The\' are beings, mortal remains and statues, clothes and 
figures, that represent the division between life and death 
that he experienced prior to that point. The labor of sifting 
through his own memory for these names leads him to 
examine all the data — internal and external, beautiful and 
ugly, happy and troubled — in which his lite has been 
enveloped. As a result, the Name Paintings serve as a shroud 
in which the old, heavy, Opaque body is wrapped and 



abandoned. After the Namt Paintings, all that will remain is 
transparency and lightness, as exemplified by Fivt Chid 
Win Hearts (for James Peto), 1969/98 (tig. 154)— the 

manifestation oi an effervescence that slowly manages to 
dissolve the lands&lt; ape ol objet ts in favor of a movement oi 
inner and outer fluids, am ient and contemporary stories. 
built up with colors, lights, densities, and transparencies that 
continue to bespeak the radiant intensity of Dines art: "My 
work is like me, I think. Definitely, it is me. I am it. 1 am tin 
work. There is no question about that. I probably am as 
closely linked to my work as any artist I know. That is, if you 
know me, you know my work. I am closed off in that way." 
The story continues.

James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ' 



From an embalmed memory of his childhood, Jim Dine 
created some of the most resilient subjects in American art. 
Made during the first ten years of his career, from 1959 to 
1969, his paintings evoke the vestiges of identity and his 
partly conscious search to recognize a self from a multitude 
of discordant parts. They possess the kind of hypnotic flash 
that begins James Joyce's coming-of-age novel, Portrait of the 
Artist as a Young Man (1916), when the inchoate yearnings of 
Stephen Dedalus's childhood make razor-sharp contact with 
the acute sensations and pungent smells of having lived 
through it. Later in life, Dine recalled: 

/ lived with my grandmother and grandfather. I had a totally free 
adolescence. I lived with these two old people. They didn't say 
anything to me. I mean what I should do and shouldn't do. I was 
traumatized anyway — the death of my mother, the expulsion from 
my father's house. And it all worked out so beautifully, because 
these people I lived with, my grandma and grandpa, were so nice to 
me. In this climate of love I was able to live this pained existence. 2 

Like a Grimms' fairy tale, Dine's paintings from this early 
period can appear light-hearted or even beastly. Bodiless 
faces, faceless bodies, animated hand tools, smeared palettes, 
and cloistered hearts push their way into the conscious world 
like children caught between the depths of knowing and the 
limits of their own expression. It was an explosive combination 
that Dine proved a master at exploiting. Of the art of the 
Abstract Expressionists on which he was weaned, Dine once 
countered, "I don't think the privations of those [artists] 
helped them."' So, with remarkably little inhibition, Dine 
dove deep into the human psyche using paint and objects as 
personas of personal exposure. In their Cracker Jack toy style 
way, his mixed-media paintings were childlike without being 
childish. Objects frequently project out from the canvas 
support, or hang, hover, or are placed precariously close to it, 
in a relief style that Dine refined over these ten years, 
providing referential elements that blur the line between 
"reality" and painted "illusion." 

Born in 1935, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dine always knew he 
would be an artist. Instinct remained the cornerstone of his 
methodology. As a child, it led him to seek inspiration from 
his immediate surroundings; and as an adolescent, it pointed 
him in the direction of the Cincinnati Art Museum and to 
numerous art books and even an occasional class or two. 
After a few years of study at several universities in Ohio in 
pursuit of a degree in art, and attending a semester at the 
renowned School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it 
became clear to the young artist that, for him, serious formal 
training was a moot point. Thanks to purloined copies of 
Art News, acquired during his years at Ohio University from 
1955 to 1957, Dine was already quite familiar with some of the 
work of the leading Abstract Expressionist painters, such as 
Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Robert Motherwell. 
In its pages he had an opportunity to find out about the 
Combines of Robert Rauschenberg (see fig. 6) and learn 
about the encaustic Flags and Targets of Rauschenberg 's 
friend and colleague Jasper Johns. Though several years older 
than Dine, Rauschenberg and Johns represented the kind of 
established artists that he could consider his peers. In fact, 
there was never a time during the first ten years of his career 
when he did not look at the art of others. Dine selected bits 
and pieces of the language of past and present art and used 
them the way he used paint and objects, mining them for 
their physical and emotional resonance. Before finally leaving 
Ohio for New York in 1958, Dine struck up a correspondence 
with Lester Johnson, a second-generation Abstract Expressionist 



24 



living in New York whose later claim was that he "repeatedly 
combined the actions [of] painting with the figure." 4 When 
Dine moved that summer to Patchogue, New York, a town 
on the south shore of Long Island, he had already assembled .1 
lexicon of artists whose work he strongly admired. 

After arriving in Patchogue, Dine got his first teaching 
position. By day, Dine taught art at the local elementary 
school; and at night, as often as he could, he drove into 
Manhattan and sought opportunities to meet some of the 
artists he had admired from afar and others like them. 
Through Johnson, Dine was introduced to Red Grooms, one 
of Johnson's art students, a maverick with materials and 
forms with whom Dine found an affinity. Dine also renewed 
his friendship with Marcus Ratlitt, one of his classmates at 
Cincinnati Walnut High School, at that time an art major at 
Cooper Union who was living in student quarters at the 
Judson Memorial Church at 239 Thompson Street, at 
Washington Square in Greenwich Village. Through Ratliff, 
Dine met Tom Wesselmann, one of Ratliff 's cronies from 
Cooper Union. 

Earlier in 1958, Ratliff and several other Cooper Union 
students, including Eva Hesse, had cleared out the basement 
of the Judson Memorial Church to use as studio space, and 
by January 1959 an unused basement storage room was 
converted into a gallery space. 5 In February, with the 
unequivocal support of the church's associate minister, 
Bernard E. ("Bud") Scott, the church's basement became the 
Judson Gallery, an artist-run exhibition space. It was the kind 
of improvised space that came to define the burgeoning New 
York avant-garde art scene of the late 1950s and early 1960s. 
On February 13, the Judson Gallery was inaugurated with an 
exhibition of paintings, drawings, and collages by Dine, 
Ratliff, and Wesselmann. Ratliff and Wesselmann met 
Swedish-born artist Claes Oldenburg sometime in March 
1959, according to Oldenburg, who, though not a student at 
Cooper Union, shelved books in its library. They sought 
Oldenburg out after seeing an exhibition of his figure 
drawings displayed on the walls around the library. 6 Soon 
after that, the then twenty-four-year-old Dine also met 
Oldenburg, six years his senior. Over the next year, the 
Judson Gallery presented several group shows that included 
works by Dine and others; and in November 1959, Dine and 
Oldenburg mounted a two-person show of their own 
works — the first joint exhibition by the two artists. This was 
followed, after a group show of drawings and prints in 
December, by the duo's ambitious exhibition of environmental 
installations, presented at the gallery from early January to 
late March i960. It featured Dine's first environment, The 
Hw/u (figs. J4, J5), and Oldenburg's environment TheStreet. 
They called the exhibition Ray-Gun and described it as a 
"three-month period of experimental constructions, derived 
from American popular art, street art, and other informal 
sources."" The Judson Gallery was not the only space where 
Dine poured his energies during those initial years in New 
York. By December i960, he was showing his works at Anna 
Reuben's downtown gallery as well. They were the kind of 
spaces that Time Inc.'s Rosalind Constable wrote about in 
her memos and monthly newsletters to the company's 
editorial board. The exposure did much to validate the goings- 
on at these two galleries, especially the Reuben Gallery, 
which, in Constable's opinion, constituted "easily the most 
aggressively avant-garde art group in New York today." 

Allan Kaprow was one of the more Infamous names on 
the scene. An art historian ami painter, Kaprow had made 
substantial inroads among artists of his generation after his 
article "The Legacy of Jackson Pollock" appeared in the 



October 1958 issue of Art .V/&lt; r, two years after Polhn k's 
death. This article about the influence of Pollocks radu al 
transformation of painting was more than an assessment of 

the ramifications ol Pollock's deployment ol materials and 
Spatial ideas. It contained a recommend.it ion tor young 
artists to go beyond Pollock by utilizing everything in the 
real world around them, including "the specific substances ol 
sight, sound, movements, people, odors, touch" and "objects 
of every sort" 9 — a suggestion that became a talisman to a 
younger generation of visual artists who wanted to capitalize 
on the idea of creating something in real time. By the time 
he and Dine met in 1959, Kaprow was already deeply 
involved with performance-based work. "Happenings" was 
Kaprow's term for such performance pieces by artists, and it 
came to represent the works of many of his contemporaries. 
Of course, performance- art was not a brand-new phenomenon: 
beginning in the late 1950s, devotees could be found in the 
United States, Europe, and Japan. By [959, Grooms had 
opened his Delancey Street Gallery, where he- presented a 
combination of his mixed-media works and performances 
Artists such as Dine, Dick Higgins, Kaprow, Oldenburg, 
Lucas Samaras, and Robert Whitman were never a cohesive 
group, but they were often featured in the same program and 
some even performed in one another's pieces. Nevertheless, 
their works were decidedly individual in concept and spirit. 
While Dine's penchant for showmanship would later seem 
at odds with the serious bout of agoraphobia he suffered a 
few years afterward, it was clearly in evidence during his 
brief stint as a performance artist. In fact, it was the brazen 
physicalness of his four performances in i960 — The Smiling 
Workman (figs. 1, 37—39), Vaudevilli Collagt (tigs. 40— 42), Car 
Cnnh (tigs. 12, 13, 44—46), and A Shining Bed(figs. 51-53) — 
that catapulted the young artist into the limelight. However, 
he all but abandoned the medium of performance art after 
December i960, returning to it only once more, with Natural 
History (TheDreams), in 1965 (figs. 138-40). lo 

During the heady years that Dine gave himself to 
performing, he never abandoned painting. The canvas 
consistently proved a much more satisfying testing ground 
tor wrestling with his trtie passion, figurative painting. 
When asked once why he was attracted to the human figure 
as a subject, Dine responded, "Human makes it a lot more 
flexible."" In his mixed-media paintings, Dine exploited in 
greater depth many aspects ot the mummery, masking, 
costuming, and other forms of identity shifting that he 
had seized on as a performance artist. After arriving m \cw 
York, Dine also became interested in experimenting with 
a variety of materials. In one of his earliest attempts at 
exploring unconventional mediums, he tried to pamt with 
melted crayons in emulation of Johns's encaustic method, 
which he admired, but he abandoned the idea because he did 
not like the results he achieved.' 1 lis ( hildhood passion for 
objects lecl him to look for usable materials on Manhattan's 
streets and on the shelves ot the tive-and-ten ami other 
variety stores. In May [959, Dines tirst son was born, and to 
commemorate the event the artist &lt; reated Altar for Jeremiah, 
[959 (fig. 2.4), a vertically stacked three-panel eamas 
featuring harlequin-style laces that freely mix masculine and 
female ( hara&lt; teristics, and containing assorted st ore- bought

Stewart: "What remains invisible to us becomes the primary 
subject of figurative art: the head and shoulders of the portrait 
and bust. Because it is invisible, the face becomes gigantic 
with meaning and significance. . . . The face becomes a text, 
a space which must be 'read' and interpreted in order to 
exist."" For Dine, the face was a powerful metonymic device, 
a referent of the soul. Moreover, it anticipated his interest 
in a singular, central object, one of his signature devices. 
Throughout his work, Dine has focused his attention on 
mostly ordinary objects through which his memories and 
emotions were distilled. Like Stephen Dedalus's "baby tuckoo," 
Dines motifs have been the center of his universe. 

Today, almost none of Dines works from the November 
1959 exhibition at the Judson Gallery and from other of his 
earliest shows remain, since he intentionally discarded or 
destroyed most of them. The Checkerboard (fig. 20), Untitled 
(After Winged Victory) (fig. 29), and Household Piece (fig. 30), all 
1959, provide a small glimpse of the types of work Dine was 
making then. Recalling this period of his career just a few 
years afterward, he said: 

/ had this idea that anything could work. I mean absolutely 
anything. . . . 1 just figured that if you worked on it long enough it 
worked and if it didn't you threw it away. There was enough trash 
to make enough other things work. . . . My show was reviewed at 
the Reuben a month before it went up and then it was a different 
show because I didn't feel like showing those things, and that 
month I made another whole show. Claes did that too. When my 
show was over I just threw most of it away. That's what almost 
everyone did that year. No one bothered — no one cared that much. 
It was based on a kind of expressionist tradition at that point 
because of knowing Kaprow and Segal and those people — and so it 
was big heads, things made out of trash and objects of clothing.' 4 

Green Suit (fig. 27), 1959, marks a breakthrough in Dines 
endeavors as a painter. It is his first assemblage featuring a 
totemic image of gender-role ambiguity, which he created by 
inserting a painted cardboard "shirt" and "tie" into the jacket 
of his corduroy suit, transforming the pants into a skirt and 
equipping it with a limp "penis" made from wadded cloth, 
and then using this mutant form of the suit as his canvas. 
Dine carried this epicene quality forth onto other images and 
even into the very language of his paintings. In several works 
featuring the necktie as a central motif, Dine conceived of 
the tie — a traditionally masculine item — as "a vaginal 
form"" (see figs. 65, 68, 69, 73). The same gender reversal can 
be found in the disjunction between the image in Pearls, 1961 
(fig. 72), and the word "pearls" that Dine painted below it, 
which, because of its deliberately smeared stenciling, could 
be mistakenly read as "penis." 16 Rather than a statement on 
the nature of sexuality, these works testify to Dines abiding 
interest in ambiguity. 

When Dine incorporated an object in a painting, he 
regarded it as "this mysterious object that metaphorically 
could be turned into something that was anonymous, but 
then became personal. If I picked up what I considered 
neutral objects, they lost their neutrality when I put my 
hand to them, or when I put them in conjunction with 
something else."' 7 In March 1963, in an interview Dine gave 
in connection with The Popular Image Exhibition, a group 
show in Washington, D.C., he said, "It's nice to start with 
some outward idea and turn in rather than start with some 
inward idea and turn out. " |S It was a platform of thinking 
that should have clearly distinguished his endeavors from the 
exterior concerns of what was eventually deemed Pop art, 
• liul yet Dine and several other artists of his generation were 



grouped with the so-called Pop artists frequently enough' 9 
for the rubric to become associated with their work, too — a 
misleading designation. Pop art's reach, even at the very 
beginning, was over-inclusive and too broadly defined 
to serve Dine's intentions or sensibilities. In retort to 
Rauschenberg, whose own work, along with that of Johns, 
was considered part of the vital infrastructure of Pop art, and 
whose goal was to bring art in line with life, Dine commented, 
"People always ask if you're one of those people who bridge 
that gap. Well, what gap? I mean there's art and there's 
life." 20 Although being tagged with the Pop label gave Dine 
international and national venues for exhibiting his work, it 
was a designation that merely skimmed the surface rather 
than grasping the essential nature of his mixed-media pieces. 

In i960, Dine moved back and forth between making 
paintings and assemblages and performing on the makeshift 
stages of the Judson and Reuben galleries. The year began 
with the last few days of a group show at the Reuben Gallery 
and his installation oiThe House at the Judson Gallery, 
followed by his first performance piece, The Smiling Workman, 
at the Judson. In April, he attended the opening of his first 
solo exhibition at the Reuben Gallery dressed in a variation 
on his persona of the Smiling Workman (fig. 5s); one of the 
few remaining works from that show is the assemblage 
Bedspring, i960 (fig. 58). That June, his assemblage Chair, 
i960 (a work related to Hanging Chair #2, Spring i960, fig. 57) 
was included in Martha Jackson's New Media — New Forms, 1 ' a 
group exhibition at her Sixty-ninth Street gallery, presenting 
sculptures and assemblages by seventy-one new and 
established artists 22 — works primarily from the preceding 
two years and constructed from a broad range of materials, 
some even with moveable parts. In the gallery's exhibition 
catalogue, Lawrence Alloway described most of the works as 
arising out of "New York junk culture" and stressed their 
connections to Dada and Futurism 23 (a point also made in 
the show itself by the inclusion of three collages by Kurt 
Schwitters done between 1917 and 1947). Another noted critic, 
Thomas Hess, described the show as representing a sea change 
in artistic sensibilities, in terms not just of the artists but of 
the audience and of social attitudes in general. 24 Jackson, a 
formidable figure on the gallery scene, was intrigued by 
Dine's work and even commissioned Dine's environment 
Spring Cabinet, 1961 (fig. 64) for another of her avant-garde 
spectaculars, Environments - Situations - Spaces, which was 
held in the spring of 1961. "We were crazy about Jim Dine," 
she later remarked. "He came to us and said that he just 
couldn't stand teaching anymore at the Rhodes School. . . . 
Nobody would give him the money to live without teaching 
except us. There was no foundation; there was no grant, 
nothing at that time." 25 

Dine never shied away from repeating himself either in 
the way he put down paint or the way he utilized certain 
motifs. On the contrary, there are numerous series from this 
period, each group of works resulting from an intensive 
elaboration of a single idea, like a theme and variations. This 
habit of investigating a particular subject at length was 
evidence of just how tenacious Dine's artistic focus would 
prove to be during those years. In 1961, Dine began to fully 
commit himself to the problematics of paint. In anticipation 
of his first solo exhibition at Jackson's gallery, scheduled 
for 1962, he embarked on what would become — in terms 
of their appearance — the most varied group of paintings 
within his concept of a series. Dine moved from an 
exploration of the color of human flesh, as in Two Nests, i960 26 
(fig. 56), to related body motifs in Hair (fig. 66) and Tattoo 
(fig. 75), both done in 1961, as well as subjects as diverse as 



26 



FredAstaire and Ginger Rogers and A Universal Color Chart 
(figs. 62 and 78), both also 196 1. During that same period, 
Dine also painted stand-ins for the body in works such as 
Coat (fig. 74), Shoe (fig. 77), Pearls (fig ^2), Thi Red Bandana 
(fig. 71), and Green Ties in a Landscape (fig. 73), all from 1961. 
The subjects he chose were not meant to be taken literally. 
"Dines motifs are verbs more than they are nouns," wrote 
Max Kozlofif. 27 This may account tor the decidedly maladroit 
quality of the motifs depicted in many of these works, which 
project the fumbling awkwardness of children's art. However, 
despite Capping into the apparent simplicity of children's art 
and even appropriating a childlike writing style for the 
emblematic words, there was never any sense of childlike 
innocence in Dines work. 

While completing the paintings for his solo show at 
Jackson's gallery, Dine also began work on a suite of 
paintings featuring various tools suspended, nailed, or glued 
onto the canvas support, thus making what are actually 
assemblages (see figs. 80-95). When Ileana Sonnabend 
visited Dines studio in 1962, the Tool paintings were what 
spurred her into giving Dine his own show at her Paris 
gallery the following year. Preceding that exhibition was a 
small solo show of Tool paintings at the Galleria Dell'Ariete 
in Milan in autumn 1962, providing Dine with his first foray 
into the European gallery circuit. However, severe emotional 
withdrawal and agoraphobia — which began about 196 1 and 
lasted until 1964 — kept Dine from traveling abroad to see 
either show. Throughout this period of great psychological 
stress, Dine applied himself steadfastly to his art, finding 
that it had a healing effect. 

Dines interest in tools goes back to a childhood fascination 
with them, linked to his grandfather's and father's hardware 
stores and his hours spent playing in a basement workshop. 
Tools first appeared as a motif in his work in i960, when he 
made a hand-drawn announcement for his performance piece 
The Smiling Workman (fig. 36). The card is covered with 
outlines of a hammer, saw, screwdriver, trowel, and other 
handyman's implements. In the Tool paintings, his combining 
of real objects and a painted surface transformed by the 
material quality of house paint allowed Dine to engage all 
his senses. He had resolved by the end of 196 1 to use 
primarily new, store-bought objects. And he liked using pre- 
mixed house paint because "the colors were without 
compromise and without subtlety" and because each color "is 
a found object . . . it's already there." 28

He used paint and objects without hierarchy. As a result, 
what is real shares the same psychological space with 
memories of the real. His works are akin to what Jacques 
Lacan has categorized as subjective phenomena, such as a 
rainbow, a motif that Dine used in several paintings 
(including figs. 59, 60). "When you see a rainbow," wrote 
Lacan, "you are seeing something purely subjective. You can 
see it at a certain distance where it joins the surrounding 
scenery. It is not there. It is a subjective phenomenon."' 
Dine avoided using chiaroscuro effects on most of his 
central motifs and instead applied them to the painted 
backgrounds of his canvases; he was not concerned with 






modeling or with painterly effects of light. However, he often 
incorporated an actual light in his works, in the form of a 
light bulb or an entire light fixture. For precedents, Dine had 
Picasso's painted image of a naked light bulb in the antiwar 
masterpiece Guernica, 1937 (fig. 5), and Rauschenberg's use of 
a working electric light fixture in his monumental Combine 
Charlene, 1954 (fig. 6). Dine used a light bulb dangling from 
a wire to illuminate an environment he did at Judson called 
Rainbow Thoughts, 196 1, and placed electrical plugs and 
sections of wire in the center of several paintings that year, 
such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He utilized the glare 
of a working light bulb in Green Shower (fig. 101) and a 
working nursery lamp in Child's Blue Wall (fig. 108), both 
1962. In addition to a light bulb, there are electric cords, 
outlets, a light socket, and two metal light fixtures in Wiring 
the Unfinished Bathroom, 1962 (fig. 106), and similar equipment 
appears in other Bathroom paintings. Lights also appear in 
several of his self-portraits from 1964. One such work, White 
Suit #2 (Self -Portrait) , 1964 (fig. 126), features a working light 
bulb as one of the predominant objects held by the imposing 
faceless figure. In 1965, when Dine returned to the stage to 
perform Natural History {The Dreams) (figs. 138—40) at the 
First New York Theater Rally, he lit his scene with a standing 
light fixture. Perhaps more important than its connections 
with Picasso or Rauschenberg, the light in Dines mixed- 
media works is a distant cousin of the kind found in the 
works of fifteenth-century Flemish masters Jan van Eyck, his 
student Petrus Christus, and Rogier van der Weyden, all of 
whose work Dine had long admired. These Northern 
Renaissance artists sought a painstaking graphic clarity in 
their application of light, giving their works an uncanny 
etched quality that dovetails with Dines interest in the 
two-dimensional. As he remarked recently, they treated 
everything in their paintings, even people, "as an object."" 
Dine uses the hard glare of artificial light the way they 
depicted the hard, clear light of day. When he does use light, 
it is not as a fleeting presence or to convey a warm glow, but 
as the Flemish masters did, as a psychologically weighted 
device. In Child's Blue Wall, for example, the gleaming 
light bulb of the shadeless nursery lamp triggers childhood 
memories of fear of the dark; while in White Suit #2 (Self- 
Portrait), the light and its hardware project the sexual charge 
of a phallus. And when he incorporates unlit light bulbs in 
a tangle of wires, as in Wiring the Unfinished Bathroom, he 
presents them as artifacts of everyday life. 

"My whole unconscious is depicted as a house," Dine said 
recently.' 2 His identification with domestic spaces and their 
various furnishings carried over into future shows, starting 
with his first solo exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, on 
Fifty-seventh Street (see fig. 97). Dine had left Jackson's 
gallery after his solo show there in January 1962 and accepted 
Janis's offer to represent him in New York, becoming one of 
the youngest in Janis's stable of artists. His debut with Janis 
was in November 1962, when Lawnmotuer, 1962 (fig. 89), was 
included in the much heralded group show International 
Exhibition of the New Realists. Dine's first solo show at Janis 
opened in February 1963 and consisted of works done in 1962 
that were all related to the theme of domestic space. These 
included several Bathroom paintings, such as Small Shower #2 
(fig. 110); The Toaster (fig. 100); and several works from the 
Room series, such as Three-Panel Study lor a Child's Room 
(fig. 107) and the monumental Four Rooms (fig. 109), his 
largest work to date. His growth as an artist was clearly 
linked to memories of the home, the initial site of his 
maturation. However, the accessories Dine mounted to his 
canvases in these assemblages are too generic, too gleaming, 



too fresh to be construed as the artist's personal souvenirs. 
There is nothing romantic or nostalgic about them. They 
were new, bought expressly to be incorporated into these 
works. The Bathrooms and Rooms are temptations, their 
constructed appearance containing both an invitation to enter 
and a warning to be circumspect. There was something rawly 
intuitive about Dine's works that was distinct from those of 
his Pop art brethren, with the possible exception of 
Oldenburg, whose early sculptural pieces were imbued with 
a homespun quality that had none of Pop art's cool irony. 

White Bathroom (fig. 105), Green Shower, and Four Rooms, all 
1962, were among the works by Dine selected by Alan 
Solomon for inclusion in the United States exhibition at the 
1964 Venice Biennale. Once again, Dine did not cross the 
Atlantic, out of fear of leaving his home and studio. In the 
fall of 1964, Dine had his second solo show at the Sidney 
Janis Gallery, featuring works that dealt with the idea of 
self-portraiture, using palettes, color charts, suits, and 
bathrobes as stand-ins for his own figure. In i960, he had 
first used the image of a painter's traditional wooden 
palette — the curves of which Dine equated with the curving 
course of the Cincinnati River, as remembered from his 
childhood — to create A 1935 Palett (fig. 26). His birth year in 
the title made it clear that it was intended as a self-portrait. 
In 1962, Dine picked up the theme again in a series of 
drawings featuring images of palettes (stolen when his studio 
was broken into later that year); and in 1963 he began a series 
of paintings and assemblages with palettes as the central 
motif, often daubed with traces of impasto. At his 1964 
exhibition at Janis, works made in 1963, such as Two Palettes 
in Black with Stovepipe (The Dream) (fig. 114), both versions of 
Two Palettes (International Congress of Constructivists and 
Dadaists. 1922) (figs. 119, 120), and Red Devil Color Chart 
No. Two (fig. 122), were shown together with a few of the 1964 
Suit paintings and the first of his Bathrobes, including Red 
Robe with Hatchet (Self-Portrait) (fig. 128), Self-Portrait Next to 
a Colored Window (fig. 131), Charcoal Self-Portrait in a Cement 
Garden (fig. 133), and Stephen Hands Path (fig. 134), all 1964. 
The pleasure Dine took in nailing, screwing, or wiring objects 
onto the canvases in these works carried a Frankensteinian 
delight in the anatomical, while the drilling, cutting, and 
chaining of materials and objects displayed a fascination with 
the disembodied. Dine was frequently queried about his 
work's relationship to Surrealism's prankish, often macabre 
sensibility and disjunctive use of freely associated images and 
objects. Certainly no artist of Dine's generation was immune 
to Surrealism's legacy. While it would be impossible to single 
out one iconic work that defined the spirit of the movement 
unleashed by writer Andre Breton in 1924, Meret Oppenheim's 
Ob jet (he Dejeuner enfourrure) (Object {The Fur Luncheon}), 
1936 (fig. 7), was certainly one of its most notorious. In 1994, 
describing Oppenheim's assemblage, Marina Warner wrote: 

The teacup and saucer and spoon of Chinese antelope hide wittily 
combine erotic innuendo, the outrageous and bristling inversions 
dear to Surrealist humour, and a deadpan comment on polite 
society's manners. It makes visible, with quite remarkable economy, 
the problematic presence of the wild in the civilized, the place of the 
animal in society, and the containment and ordering oj female 
sexuality. }} 

Of Oppenheim's teacup, Dine once commented, "It seemed 
the most natural thing in the world."" Thus, the jolting 
effect of the Surrealists' "outrageous" juxtapositions was 
simply lost on Dine, whose own impulses had naturally 
led him to the margins of social propriety in his art.

Paint had always been Dines primary medium, and he 
even incorporated it in one form or another into his 
environments and performances. Stains of dripping paint 
wire in full view everywhere in The House (figs. 34, 35). The 
House was a rare invitation to experience a painter's bedlam, 
at once a paradise and hell of paint, debris, and accumulated 
memories. In his first performance piece, Tht Smiling Workman 
(figs. 1, 37-39 ), Dine startled his audience by drinking from 
a bucket of reel "paint" (actually tomato juice) and pouring 
the rest over his head. For his performance piece Car (.rash 
(figs. 12, 13, 44-46) eight months later, he had painted the 
word "HELP!" onto a roll of paper towels, one word per 
sheet, and unrolled the prepainted scroll during the 
performance. And for his environment Spring Cabinet, 1961 
(fig. 64), he had planned to expose viewers to the risk of 
being splattered by paint while watching a "drip painting" in 
the making, by hanging buckets of green paint from the 
ceiling and having the paint drip onto a canvas on the floor 
while electric fans were blowing; but the gallery vetoed 
the "action" component of this "action painting."'" In his 
mixed-media works, Dine embraced both dense and airy 
applications of oil paint, his pigment of choice. Although his 
works are far from traditional, Dines dedication to figurative 
work and his continued preference for oil were clear signals 
that he considered himself to be part of the tradition of 
Western painting.' 6 In fact, he did occasionally use acrylics or 
enamels on canvas, but oil paint remained his primary 
medium — until he turned to sculpture. 

In 1965, Dine put aside his oil brushes and began to cast 
individual forms. This was something of a leap for the 
dedicated painter that Dine was, but it was not all that 
surprising, considering his abiding interest in objects. The 
sculptures that Dine cast — motorcycle boots and a table cast 
in bronze, and a bench, hammers, an air pump, and an axe 
cast in the lighter metal aluminum — repeat the predominant 
preoccupations of his paintings: clothes, furniture, and tools 
(see figs. 113, 137, 143, 145, 146, 149). After starting with junk 
found in the street and then using store-bought items, Dine 
was finally making his own objects. His sculpted forms are 
different from the real-world objects that enlivened the 
surfaces of his paintings, and function differently as well. In 
imitating the look of an object, Dine often created a hybrid 
rather than merely duplicating its form. For example, Double 
Hammer Doorway (fig. 143) and The Red Axe (fig. 149), both 
1965, have something of the freakish quality of an elongated 
reflection in a funhouse mirror; and for A Boot Bench Ochre #2 
(see fig. 113), Dine used a pair of boots to support a wood 
plank, and cast the resulting "bench" in aluminum. 
However, these mutant versions of ordinary objects were 
never intended to create a breach between the object and the 
audience, for Dine never conceived of them as surreal or 
unnatural. It was more out of a feel for the pleasure of 
carnival that he tapped into the notions of monstrosity and 
mutation, where, as Susan Stewart has pointed out, "the 
grotesque is an exaggeration and celebration of the 
productive and reproductive capacities of the body, of the 
natural in its most sensual dimensions. "'" Indeed, for Dine, 
mutations are a part of nature. These longer, skinnier 
versions of everyday objects stand at the threshold of being 
and becoming, halfway between the ordinary and the 
freakish. Unlike most people, who might consider them 
"abnormal" and assume that such exaggerated characteristics 
would prevent the objects from functioning, Dine sees no 
reason why they could not be put to use. 

In 1966, Dine placed his sand-casted replicas onto sections 
of canvases spray-painted with blue automobile lacquer 
in his suite A.R. at Oberlin, an ode to the German poet

Rainer Maria Rilke. The works in this series, created after a 
ten-day teaching residency at Oberlin College, are the most 
enigmatic of all his mixed-media assemblages. The freedom 
to invent his own objects inspired him to test their conceits 
within the realm of painting. His objects appear more 
fragmented and disconnected from the whole. Instead of the 
taxonomy he had established in previous works, Dine risked 
the feeling of absence in order to confront the idea of loss. 
The textual signals of his earlier paintings gave way to a 
profound sense of quietude in A.R. at Oberlin #4 (Putting 
Aside Reo Blue) and A.R. at Oberlin #y (A Thing of Rilke) 
(figs. 148, 147), which exude a tenderness and fragility 
previously unknown in his works. Not until 1968 would Dine 
paint again. 

During his eight-month residency at Cornell University's 
College of Architecture, beginning in the fall of 1966, Dine 
created seven monumental objects for his installation Nancy 
and I at Ithaca. Two of them still exist — one (fig. 150) in the 
shape of a hand, and the other (fig. 151) in the shape of a 
heart, the motif that became the most famous of his career 
after it reappeared in several later works. When he resumed 
painting in 1968, Dines work continued to grow more 
massive in scale. 

The strains of living and working in New \ork prompted 
him to make a radical change in mid- 1967. Heartened by his 
first visit to London, which he traveled to by boat in the 
spring of 1966 — his first trip outside the United States — 
Dine decided to move there with his entire family in June of 
the following year. His decision to stop painting for a while 
arose from a financial disagreement with Sidney Janis, rather 
than from any artistic block on his part. When he returned 
to the medium that had sustained him since childhood, he 
embarked on a project that was a literal embodiment of 
autobiography, Name Painting #/, 1968 — 69 (fig. 155), his 
largest painting up to that time. A painting by way of a 
poem, it listed the names of all the individuals he could 
remember having known or met over the course of his life, 
from the year of his birth to 1965. He completed the project in 
a second, smaller canvas, Name Painting #2, which resumed 
the list in 1965 and brought it up to 1969. 

Like Joyce's protean hero, Stephen Dedalus, Dine brought 
more questions than answers to this initial body of work, and 
it enriched the very core of his artistic endeavors. In the 
novel, Dedalus muses, "Here are some questions I set myself: 
Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the portrait ofMona 
Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of Sir Philip Crampton 
lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement or a child or a louse be 
a work of art? If not, why not?"' 8 Rather than try to locate a 
truth, Dine interrogated its perimeters. His mixed-media 
works from 1959 to 1969 are a record of a developing mind, 
and represent the questioning spirit that continues to guide 
the course of American art.

A "Painter's Theater": Jim Dine's Environments and For a brief period in the early 1960s, Jim Dine produced 

Performances several environmental works and four of his five theater 

Julia Blaut pieces or Happenings, as this type of theater by artists was 

known. 1 His active involvement in creating and performing 
"painter's theater" took place between January i960, when he 
constructed his first environment, The House, at the Judson 
Gallery, and May 1961, when his last environment, Spring 
Cabinet, was presented in the Environments — Situations — 
Spaces exhibition at the Martha Jackson Gallery. 2 The change 
in venue, in just under a year and a half, represented a 
shift from the margins of the New 'York art world into its 
mainstream. Environments — and specifically Dine's work — 
moved from an artist-run, alternative exhibition space in the 
basement of the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich 
Village, to the elegant brownstone that housed the Martha 
Jackson Gallery on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 3 
Subsequently, Dine stopped making environments and 
Happenings because "it was becoming so chic" and "it was 
taking too much from my painting." 4 With hindsight, Dine 
later told an interviewer that "the Happenings were about 
trying to become famous. We were having fun; we were 
still children." 5 

The environments and Happenings, however, were more 
than a way for Dine to fulfill his "big ambition to be heard 
all the way back to Ohio." 6 Although they constitute only 
a small portion of this prolific artist's overall production, 
the environments and related theater pieces reveal the 
various conflicting forces in the New York art world in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s. Dine's ambivalent relationship 
to Abstract Expressionism was played out in these works, 
often by reenacting the ritual of Action Painting in order to 
move beyond its example. For Dine, the environments and 
Happenings manifested artistic concerns that remain central 
to his work to the present day: preoccupations with 
figuration, autobiography, psychology, and the tools and 
practice of the painter. What set Dine's work apart from 
Abstract Expressionism, and later from Pop art, is its 
romantic subjectivity — precisely the quality that made his 
work so significant for developments in artist-made 
performances of the 1970s. 

Dine arrived in New York in 1958, at the age of twenty- 
three, two years after the death of Jackson Pollock. While 
still a student at Ohio University, where he earned a B.F.A. 
in 1957, he "schooled [himself] on Art News," 7 in the pages of 
which he witnessed the unfolding of the powerful mythology 
of both Abstract Expressionism and the painters associated 
with the movement. It was also through Art News that he 
learned about artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper 
Johns, and Allan Kaprow, who presented a challenge to the 
prevailing Modernist aesthetic. Dine did not reject Abstract 
Expressionism outright, instead maintaining a relationship 
to the New York School artists like that of "fathers and 
sons." 8 Indeed, the painterly gesture and high emotional 
content intrinsic to that movement have remained hallmarks 
of his own style. Dine, however, did not subscribe to the goal 
of creating universal statements about the human condition 
by means of an abstract idiom, as they did. His art is more 
idiosyncratically autobiographical and uses concrete, 
figurative images drawn from everyday life. It is, as he has 
said, about "the layers of myself" and "deal[s] with the things 
I'm familiar with, everyday objects, parts of my body, parts 
of my wife's body, the tools I grew up with, the bathrooms in 
my uncle's store." 9 

Kaprow, formerly an abstract painter himself and an art 
history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, was an 
important influence on Dine in loosening the stronghold of 



Abstract Expressionism. Dine met him in [959 through the 
Reuben andjudson galleries. Main years after he had 
returned to painting as his primary medium, Dine recounted 
how, when he first came to New York, 

Kaprow particularly impressed me. . . . (He) exerted a strong 
influence on all of us in Nt w York at that time, particularly 
me, because I was tht youngest and probably tht most 
impressionable . . . He influenced me as &lt;/ teacher influences a 
student . . . Painting was dead; Jackson Pollock killed painting 
by dancing around tht canvas and using rocks and other things 
from external sources — bits oj glass and other things he could 
find — in his paintings. Kaprow wrote an article in Art News 
about that. It was called "Tht Legat ) of Jackson Pollock. " / think. 
The legacy was us. The legacy was visual events dancing around 
tht canvas and using junk— but without tht canvas. Thosi wen 
the happenings. '" 

Kaprow's now-famous article, "The Legacy of Jackson 
Pollock," published in 1958, 11 became a kind of manifesto for 
environments and Happenings and declared the direction or 
art in the 1960s. Here Kaprow argued that 

by making mural-scale paintings, {Pollock's work] ceased to 
become paintings andbecamt environments. . . . tht painting is 
continued on out into the room. And this leads us to our final 
point: Space. . . . The "picture" has moved so far out that the 
canvas is no longer a re/en nee point. Hence, although up on the 
wall, these marks surround us as they did tht painter at work. . . . 
Pollock, as I see him. left us at tht point when we must becomt 
preoccupied with and even dazzled by tht span and objects of our 
everyday life, either our bodies, clothes, rooms, or. if need be. the 
vastness of Forty-Second Street. . . . all will become materials for 
this new concrete art. "'' 

The ideas that Kaprow put forward in "The Legacy of 
Jackson Pollock" comprise a direct assault on the prevailing 
formalist theories articulated in the writings of art critic 
(dement Greenberg and the teachings of Hans Hoffman, 
with whom Kaprow had studied; environments and 
Happenings moved paintings off the wall and into real space 
and time, undermining the integrity of the picture surface 
and blurring the distinctions between different mediums and 
between art and life. 

Kaprow illustrated his article with photographs of Pollock 
at work, taken by Rudolph Burckhardt from overhead, which 
i (impounded the impression that "Pollock . . . was 'in' his 
work."" Kaprow's book Assemblage. Environments &amp; 
Happenings (ca. 1966) instead included the photographs of 
Pollock painting by Hans Namuth (see fig. X). 1 ' These 
photographs, as well as a film by Namuth on Pollock, 
contributed to the discourse on the artist as an "Action 
Man."' 1 It is this view of Pollock that had been developed 
by Harold Rosenberg in his [952 article "The American 
Action Painters," where he argues that to the Abstract 
Expressionists "the canvas began to appear ... as an arena, " 
and "the painter had become .111 actor.""' Rosenberg s 
article together with Namuth's photographs contributed to 
Kaprow's idea of Pollock setting a precedent for the artist 
as performer.' 

Kaprow traced the lineage of environments and 
Happenings back to precedents that were primarily, though 
not exclusively, in the visual arts: from Cubist collage to 
Action Painting and assemblage of the mid-i9sos.' s The main 
practitioners of the earliest environments and Happenings 
were trained as painters: in addition to Kaprow and Dine, 



there were also Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman, and Red 
Grooms. Their performances took place- largely in alternative 
art spaces, particularly the I [ansa, Reuben, and [udson 
galleries and the Delancey Street Museum. Emphasizing 
the link to painting. Dine referred to his performances as .1 
"painter's theater," in part to distinguish them from 
Happenings, which had become inextricably linked to 
Kaprow and the "rules" he established tor them. Rosalind 
Constable, a cultural correspondent at Time, Inc. during the 
n;sos and 1960s, also emphasized the painterrj aspe&lt; ts o\ the 
Happenings, referring to them as "'live painting.' living 
pictures,' or 'painting as environment. ''' 

Kaprow also pointed to precedents from outside the- visual 
arts. These included the performances ol earlier generations 
ot artists — Dada, Surrealist, and Futurist theater as well as 
popular performance, sue h as "mime, the c ire us, c anm als, 
the traveling saltimbanques, all the way to medieval mystery 
plays and processions.'"'' The class on experimental music 
taught by the composer John Cage at the New School tor 
Social Research in New York, which Kaprow attended 
between n;s~ and I9S9, also proved to be extremely 
influential. 23 Attracting a wide range of students, including 
musicians, painters, sculptors, poets, and filmmakers, Cage 
advocated cross-fertilization between disciplines and an 
integration ot everyday experience into art. His teachings 
reflected his own interests in Zen Buddhism, Due lump, 
Dada, Surrealism, and Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty. ' In 1 s 2 , 
at Black Mountain College, Cage had experimented with a 
spontaneous, interdisciplinary theater performance, which 
came to be known as Theater Piect fti, and which served as 
the immediate forerunner to the Happenings. During these 
years, Kaprow created his first environments and, in the 
context of Cages New School class, took part in the first 
Happening- like events. 25 

It was Oldenburg who encouraged Dine to make his first 
environment. Under the exhibition title Ray-Gun, held at 
thejudson Gallery from January to March i960. Dines 
environment The Houst was presented together with an 
environment by Oldenburg called Tht Strut." The works 
were conceived as pendants, the house and the street 
respectively representing private and public domains. 
"Ray-Gun" refers to a key motif in Oldenburg's work from 
this period, a cross between a child's toy and a phallus; it 
has been described as his "alter ego — as both a person . . . 
and an object." (It was illustrated in Tht Villagt Voict 
advertisement for the exhibition.) The "Ray-Gun" motif 
emerged as Oldenburg moved away from figurative painting 
and began making three-dimensional objects that "serve[d] 
as surrogates tor the human body. " In his paintings and 
assemblage. Dine too would develop a vocabulary ol ob|c-c ts 
that became metaphors tor the body. 

Dine and Oldenburg scoured the areas around Washington 
Square for used objects and street materials, out ot which 
they fashioned both animate and inanimate objects tor their 
environments. lor 7 Ac Street, Oldenburg made cars, people, 
and various urban objects from the same near-monochrome 
combinations ot newspaper, rags, wire, cardboard, and spra\ 
pamt. In contrast, according to Timt magazines review, 
Dines Houst was "a shocking pink and green affair with 
bedspringS hanging from the ceiling and an umbrella 
protruding from the wall, with cardboard signs reading 
Breakfast' Is Reach. Go to Work.' and Win (ant We Be 
Friends?'" " Elsewhere it was described as 

a blazt of c(dor. its furnishings "derived from American popular 
art. street art and other informal wurct r. " Clost examination oj

the walls reveal(s) thai one is a kitchen (beer cans, egg boxes, 
bottles), and another Mother's room, with jewel box, mirror and 
bronzed baby shoe. All through the house is the sound of breathing 
and heart beats, as well as more intimate {and decidedly less 
attractive) sounds, and an occasional voice asking: ''Why can't we 
befriends?" 30 

Ray-Gun was Dine and Oldenburg's second joint 
exhibition. The first, held at the Judson Gallery a few 
months earlier, 3 ' had already revealed both artists' shared 
interest in human subjects. While Oldenburg showed figure 
paintings, Dine exhibited works from his "expressionist 
heads" series (figs. 18—22, 25). " 32 Dine had begun these at his 
uncle's cabin in rural Kentucky during the summer of 1958, 
before meeting Oldenburg, and continued the series at the 
cabin the following summer. The roughly drawn and painted 
images, often interpreted as self-portraits, would have 
appealed to Oldenburg, who was interested in figuration, 
masks, the art of Jean Dubuffet, and art brut." 

During the course of their first joint exhibition, Dine and 
Oldenburg participated with Kaprow and figurative painter 
Lester Johnson in a panel discussion held at the Judson 
Gallery, entitled "New Uses of the Human Image in 
Painting." 34 Throughout the discussion, Dine and Oldenburg 
expressed a continued desire to show the human form in 
art, which went against the current trend of abstraction. 
Beyond showing the subject illusionistically on canvas, they 
aimed at depicting the figure in its environment as a way to 
reach their audience. 3 '' Oldenburg declared that, unlike 
artists before him, who wanted "everything to happen on the 
picture plane," his impulse was "to make it come to life — to 
be an actual living thing." As Kaprow stated, this was not 
"to repudiate the past art that has preceded us, [but] to keep 
art alive." 36 This is the concept that lay behind the 
environments that Dine and Oldenburg would begin in the 
following month. 

In theory, visitors to the Ray-Gun show were asked to 
participate in the construction of The House and The Street, 
lending a performative aspect to the otherwise static 
environments. In the "Judson Gallery Spring Calendar," 
Dine and Oldenburg indicated that the exhibition 
space would be open during construction, "in order to 
encourage participation and development of the RAYGUN 
idea." Furthermore, they stated that "while RAYGUN is 
begun by two artists, it is hoped others will join in during 
the RAYGUN period." 37 Audience participation was 
something that Kaprow had fostered, and was integral to 
his concept of how Happenings evolved out of environments. 
In his statement in Michael Kirby's anthology Happenings 
(1965), Kaprow wrote: 

/ immediately saw that every visitor to the Environment was 
part of it. . . . And so I gave him occupations like moving 
something, turning switches on . . . this suggested a more "scored" 
responsibility for that visitor. I offered him more and more to do, 
until there developed the Happening. ;,v 

Although Oldenburg did not assign particular tasks, as 
Kaprow did, he "invited the audience to add its own debris 
to the floor of The Street and encouraged other artists to pin 
up anything whatsoever on the 'communication board' he 
had set up adjacent to the gallery."' 4 

Dine was more reticent about audience involvement 
with his work, later saying: "I never wanted anyone to be 
part of my art other than to take from it, . . . but I don't 
want anyone to participate." 40 However, in photographs of 



34 



The House when it was under construction and after it was 
officially opened to the public (figs. 34, 35), one can see real 
people occasionally incorporated into Dines "habitable 
sculpture" and treated as found objects." Among the 
newspaper, rags, and painted references to the human body, 
Dines real human subjects are carefully placed by the artist 
and become completely integrated into the environment. On 
the tickets to the Ray Gun Spex (fig. 33) — three evenings of 
Happenings held at the Judson Memorial Church, February 
29 through March 2, during the course of Dines and 
Oldenburg's Ray-Gun installations — The House is described 
as "inhabited," a likely reference to live figures as well as to 
suggestions of a human presence in the form of painted body 
parts, objects for human use, and the audio of breathing, 
heartbeats, and voices. 42 

Just as Kaprow had traced the lineage of environments 
back to Pollock's mural-scale paintings, so Dine and 
Oldenburg invoked a similar heritage for The House and The 
Street when they called these constructions "painting in the 
shape of a house" and "painting in the shape of a city 
street." 4 ' The dispersal of materials in The House, the 
expressive handling of paint, and the allover composition 
(walls, floor, and ceiling), have often been equated with the 
"temperamental thrust ... of abstract expressionism." 44 The 
heads, eyes, and other references that emerge from the layers 
of paint-saturated fabric and paper collage in Tht House can 
be compared to the hidden images of eyes and teeth that 
Willem de Kooning included in many of his allover 
abstractions, such as Excavation, 1950 (fig. 10). ,s 

Yet the differences between works by the New York School 
and Dines and Oldenburg's environments are at least as 
great as their similarities. Rather than merely expanding 
upon Abstract Expressionism, the environments are also a 
critique of its doctrine. 46 Even though Pollock often 
embedded pebbles and other small objects, such as the tops 
of paint tubes and cigarette butts, into the layers of paint he 
poured and dripped onto his canvases, his paintings did not 
break from a flat, rectilinear picture surface; Dine's willful 
inclusion of found, three-dimensional materials that clearly 
reflected the history of their former use represented a radical 
departure. 4 " Made from junk materials and lasting only as 
long as the exhibition, the environments completely 
undermined the concept of the rarefied art object. 48 Finally, 
for other artists who came to be associated with Pop art 
in the early 1960s, Dine's House set a precedent for focusing 
on subjects drawn from the home; this emphasis on the 
traditionally domestic domain of women has been 
interpreted as a challenge by this new generation of artists to 
the hypermasculinity that was inscribed in the critical 
discourse on Abstract Expressionism. 49 

Dine resumed his dialogue with that movement in his first 
theater piece. The Smiling Workman, presented as part of the 
Ray Gun Spex program of Happenings. Another version of 
this theater piece, staged for Stan Vanderbeek's short silent 
film with the same title, took place in the environment of 
The House. Dine is shown moving through the "rooms" of his 
house, performing such everyday activities as eating a 
banana. so Wearing a full-length, paint-spattered smock and 
with a mask painted on his face, he is nearly camouflaged 
amidst painted rags and images of masklike faces. In 
contrast to the passive "inhabitants" of The House, Dine takes 
an active role as performer. On a large, blank sheet of paper 
resembling a canvas, he sets about painting a series of 
cartoonlike heads, writes the words "I love," drinks from a 
bucket of "paint,"" pours the remainder on his head, and 
then completes his sentence to read: "I love what I'm doing, 



HELP!" He then dues through his painting— an act thai has 
been interpreted as a parody of the perceived athleticism ol 
"Action Painting," of Pollock being "in" his canvas, and a 
literal puncturing of the picture surface. 

There are some apparent differences between the- filmed 
version of TheSmiling Workman and the performances of it 
done in the context of Ray dun Spex. Martha I lolmes's 
photographs of one of these performances (figs. 37-39) closel) 
match Dine's description of the piece in his statement in 
Kirby's Hi i/&gt;/h nings : 

/ had a flat built. It was a three-panel flat with tu ridt 1 and one 
flat. Then was a table with thret jars of paint and two brushes on 
it, andthi canvas was painted white. I cami around it with ont 
light on me. I was all in red with a big black mouth: all my fact 
and head urn red. and I had a red smock on, down to tht floor, I 
painted "I lovt what I'm doing" in orangt and blue. When I got to 
"what I'm doing." it was going very fast, and I picked up ont oj 
the jars and drank tht [hunt, and then I poured the other two jars 
of paint over my head, quickly, and dm e, phy fically, through tht 
canvas. The light went off. It was likt a thirty-second moment oj 
intensity. It was like a drawing. 

In The Smiling Workman, the end product for Dine is the 
performance of making art, rather than a durable art object; 
this became a recurrent theme of Dine's theater works. ' 
Dine played the role of the Action Painter and, as recorded 
in Holmes's photographs, produced and then destroyed 
the quintessential Abstract Expressionist canvas. Like the 
painting he made in the Vanderbeek film, it also 
incorporated the human image, but this time it is a direct 
trace of himself. Surrounding a uniform color-field of 
gestural strokes, Dine is shown slapping his handprints 
around the edges of the canvas. The painting seems to be a 
response to works by Pollock, such as Numhcr 1. 1048, 1948 
(fig. 9), where handprints mark the edge of the canvas and 
refer to the artist's act of creation by leaving an imprint of his 
physical presence in the work. Dine's inclusion of the 
handprints is like the "diaristic gesture" to which Kaprow 
refers in "The Legacy of Jackson Pollock," where he writes 
that Pollock's "so-called 'dance' of dripping, slashing, 
squeezing, daubing and whatever else went into a work, 
placed an almost absolute value upon a kind of diaristic 
gesture." 55 

Throughout the twentieth century, artist-made 
performances have resisted prevailing "high" art 
conventions. s6 In keeping with this assumption, The Smiling 
Workman is a parody of Abstract Expressionism and the 
notion of Action Painting. Dine's use of the mask furthers 
this interpretation; he appears as a clown, and as such, 
belongs to the culture of carnival and its emancipating 
function. In Rabelais and His World (1965), Russian cultural 
critic Mikhail Bakhtin established that the aesthetic category 
of the grotesque, to which clowns belong, is linked to the 
annual celebration of carnival, which allowed tor a 
"temporary liberation from the prevailing truth and from the 
established order. ' s ~ The mask, according to Bakhtin, 
"reveals the essence of the grotesque" and is fundamental to 
the carnival as "it is connected with the joy ot change . . . 
with the merry negation of uniformity and similarity; it 
rejects conformity to oneselt. s The carnival spirit, Bakhtin 
contended, "otters the chance to have a new outlook on the 
world . . . and to enter a completely new order ot things." 1 

It is in this Liberating spirit of destabilizing cultural norms 
that Dine performed his "painter's theater." Hut. as Bakhtin 
argues, carnival laughter is ambivalent — "he who is laughing 



H 



also belongs to it" — as opposed to the satirist whose laughter 
"is negative [and who] places himself above the object of his 
mockery." 60 Certainly Dine had an equivocal relationship to 
Abstract Expressionism; he embraced its emotive and 
gestural aspects, yet he looked for ways, in all mediums, to 
move beyond its example, by his incorporation of concrete 
objects and his adamant emphasis on autobiography. 

Dine once stated that The Smiling Workman was not meant 
to be funny: "I do not think obsession is funny or that not 
being able to stop one's intensity is funny." 61 Fellow artist Al 
Hansen later referred to The Smiling Workman as Dines "first 
psycho-drama." 61 The phrase Dine scrawled across the 
canvas — "I love what I'm doing, HELP!" — might refer to 
the famously angst-ridden art-making practices of the 
Abstract Expressionists, but more likely to his own intensity 
about painting. The feverish pace, underscored by Dine's 
chanting throughout the performance, seems to reflect his 
attitudes about the ritualistic act of making art, as expressed 
in such comments as "I paint out of a compulsion" or "I do 
what I do because I have to. I can't stop myself." 6 ' When 
speaking to a Time Magazine reporter in i960, Dine put a 
positive spin on this aspect of his works, saying that the 
performance was "meant to show 'the feeling of being a 
happy compulsive painter, which is what I am.'" 64 Dine later 
revealed that during this period, just as he was beginning to 
experience success, he abandoned making Happenings, in 
part because he was undergoing a nervous breakdown. 65 

Although the performance itself was short-lived, the 
persona of the Smiling Workman lived on as a reflection of 
Dine's obsessive art-making practices and his intense 
identification with the craft of painting. For example, for 
the opening of his solo exhibition at the Reuben Gallery on 
April 1, i960, 66 Dine dressed the part of the Smiling 
Workman (fig. 55; see also fig. 1). Like the clowns of Francois 
Rabelais's novel, he was not merely an actor playing a part, 
but remained a clown beyond the performance, standing "on 
the borderline between life and art, in a peculiar mid- 
zone." 67 Although Dine replaced the smock — the working 
attire of the artist — with the more festive clothing of a 
jacket, knickers, high boots, and a red bandanna around his 
neck, he retained the Smiling Workman's painted mask. Two 
years later, Dine was referred to as "The Smiling Workman" 
in an exhibition review, and decades later he told an 
interviewer how physically hard he worked, saying "I'm very 
proud to be a workman." 68 

Dine continued his dialogue with Abstract Expressionism 
in his site-specific environment Spring Cabinet (fig. 64), made 
for the Environments - Situations — Spaces exhibition held in 
the spring of 1961 at the Martha Jackson Gallery. 69 Here, the 
Smiling Workman is replaced by inanimate objects: the 
artist's tools of palette and paint cans. The palette, which 
also appeared in a collage-painting from i960 and in a series 
of mixed-media assemblages that Dine made in 1963 — 64, 
served as a surrogate self-portrait, 70 as his bathrobe did in 
another series in 1964. In Spring Cabinet, the environment 
that Dine created was supposed to include a component of 
performance, but this time without a human agent: Green 
paint, contained in cans suspended from the ceiling, was 
supposed to drip onto a large "floor pallet" [sic] (a palette- 
shaped canvas placed on the floor); however, in the end, the 
gallery did not allow the paint to drip. 7 ' The action of the 
"drip painting" would have been augmented by the blowing 
ol i ■](•&lt; trie fans placed in the environment. An allover 
abstra&lt; t composition on canvas covered the walls, the result 
ot rubbing pigment onto the canvas after placing it over a 
patterned tin ceiling panel. The final effect was an enclosed 



space completely taken over by the work of the artist, much 
as Pollock's works became all-encompassing environments, 
as documented by Namuth (see fig. 8) and described by 
Kaprow. 

Following The Smiling Workman, Dine's next performance 
piece was called interchangeably Vaudeville Act or Vaudeville 
Collage (figs. 40-42) a one-time event held at the Reuben 
Gallery on June 11, 1960/ 2 Although a few years later 
Dine described The Smiling Workman as "a blackout or a 
vaudeville act," 73 the term "vaudeville" better suits this 
second performance work's lighthearted spirit, which was 
closer to that of American nineteenth- and early twentieth- 
century popular theater. This comes across in Dine's 
description of it: 

/ had a stage built. It was like an old-time stage with two flats of 
canvas on each side, and over the top it said, "Jim Dine's 
Vaudeville" in Day glow color. There was a tape recording made 
for that. It was all kinds of crazy things: organ music, me 
talking — it was a collage on tape. I came out with a red suit on 
and cotton all over me, my face painted yellow. To the music that 
was going on. I pulled the cotton off and just let it fall to the floor 
until there was no cotton on me. Then I walked out. As soon as I 
walked out, inanimate objects became actors. Two people behind the 
flats operated a dance of strung cabbages and carrots and lettuce 
and celery. That stopped quickly, and red paint was poured down 
the flats on each side and onto the floor. That was another "act." 
The final act was: I came out with my red suit on and a straw hat 
on this time. On each arm I had a nude girl made out of cardboard 
so that each of my arms became their inner arms. These were ?nade 
like puppets — Javanese puppets. I did a dance. 74 

The name Vaudeville Collage makes explicit the 
longstanding relationship in the avant-garde between 
popular theater and the Cubist tradition, two of the primary 
sources for the fast-paced, montagelike structure of the 
Happenings. 75 Several evenings of early Happenings, in 
which Dine participated, referred to popular forms of 
performance. For example, The Smiling Workman was part of 
Ray Gun Spex, and "spex" is an abbreviated form of the 
Swedish word for burlesque 76 ; and Dine's performance work 
A Shining Bed was part of a larger program called Varieties, 
variety being the English counterpart to American 
vaudeville." In Vaudeville Collage, the term "collage" refers to 
the splicing together of disparate, short acts as well as to the 
sound-collage played throughout the performance. According 
to Hansen, the use of collage was integral to the structure of 
Happenings: "Happenings . . . are theater pieces in the 
manner of collage and . . . each action or situation or event 
that occurs within their framework is related. . . . The 
happening is a collage of situations and events occurring over 
a period of time in space.'" 8 

The program to Vaudeville Collage lists a cast of characters 
that combine vaudeville and art references: "Jim Dine as The 
Strawpuller and The Dancer; The Juggler played by Leafy 
Vegetables; Two Chorus Girls played by Two Pieces of 
Cardboard; Red Paint played by Powdered Tempera." The 
pouring of the red paint in this performance piece, as in The 
Smiling Work/nan, is a reference to the paint pouring that 
Pollock established as an iconic gesture of Abstract 
Expressionist art-making practice. The Leafy Vegetables, 
which Dine refers to as "inanimate objects [that] became 
actors," anticipate his later work where objects, particularly 
parts of the body or objects for human use, such as clothing, 
furniture, or tools, are used as metaphors for the human 
body as a whole." 9 



(6 



The high energy of Vaudeville Collage made it an enormous 
popular success. Dine was particularly pleased with its 
ettec tiveness in reaching his audience: He would recall: 

/ do not even understand how I did that dance. I could never do it 
now. But I did this dance that peoplt cheered. And the) ton my 
clothe* off. Encores! Ami I ripped off my tit and threw it into thi 
audience. It was an incredible scene. In thi senst oj audiena 
participation, I bavi never felt it stronger with wmeom elst or 
with me. People remember it .is a fantastic &gt;ii^ht. s " 

Dines next performance piece. Car Crash, held at the 
Reuben Gallery in November 1960 s ' (figs. 12, 13, 44-46), 
involved the audience in a different way. Unlike his earlier 
pieces, in which the performer and the audience had been 
divided, Dine arranged the seats for Car Crash in a 1 1 shape 
around the space; and, instead ot the audience being asked to 
participate, as they had been in other Happenings by several 
of Dines peers, the performers moved freely among the 
members of the audience. It was the first of Dines theater 
pieces where he used performers besides himself: the cast of 
Car Crash included Pat (Muschinski) Oldenburg, Judy 
Tersch, and Marcus Ratliff Dine retained full artistic control 
over the other performers: scripting the spoken parts, 
producing costume designs/" and subjecting them to three 
One-hour rehearsals/' 

Car Crash was the first of Dines theater works to come 
"not directly from nightmares . . . [but] from a life of bad 
dreams. " V| It was based on two car accidents in which Dine 
was involved in 1959, the first while he was driving alone and 
the second with his family. 85 The personal nature of the 
subject matter is underscored in the announcement card for 
the performance, where the central image is stamped several 
times with Dines fingerprints; 86 these autographic marks are 
combined with car imagery and crosses, which form the 
recurrent iconography of the performance as well as of the 
assemblages, paintings, drawings, and prints inspired by the 
car crash theme (see figs. 43, 48, 49). 8? On entering the 
Reuben Gallery, "the visitor found himself in a small room, 
the walls of which were solidly lined with drawings ami 
paintings by Dine. All the works contained crosses — usually 
the blocky symbol of the Red Cross — and some had tirelike 
circles." Like the solo exhibition at the Reuben Gallery the 
preceding spring, the installation of artworks constituted a 
kind of environment; Dine did not conceive of these artworks 
as dispensable, however, but rather as "permanent objects. " s 

Passing through the small room, the visitor entered the 
space where the performance would be given. Using 
materials left by the previous tenant and adding a coat of 
white paint throughout, Dine created a set that he later 
described as "as strong an environment as I ever built." 8 ' In 
her review, Jill Johnston wrote: "Mr. Dine literally encloses 
everyone within a collage room. It includes objects relating to 
cars and crashes, and one side consists of large hunks and 
rolls of cork and cardboard strewn about in shelves. 
Everything is drippingly white-washed. A mess, yet ghostly 
pristine. " ,JO Dine had even considered giving the viewers 
white caps and smocks to wear in an attempt to preserve the 
purity of the Environment." By all accounts, the whiteness 
gave the room a kind of sepulchral or hospital feeling, with 
tires, tubing, gloves, and other objects that implied body and 
car parts evoking the debris ot an accident. 9 ' A recording of 
honking horns ami other street noises played throughout t he- 
piece, providing yet another sensory dimension. 

Dine was the protagonist ot Car Crash, playing the leading 
role ot the "Car" as well as that of the artist. Whereas all the

other players wore white costumes, like animated objects in 
the all-white environment, Dine was dressed completely in 
silver, with silver face paint, black circles around his eyes and 
nostrils, red lips, and flashlights jutting from his cap. 
Described as "half carnival clown, half avenging angel," 92 
Dine, as the "Car," tried unsuccessfully throughout the 
performance to express himself verbally, but all he produced 
were grunts of despair; where words failed him, he 
obsessively drew on the blackboard a car with "a monster 
jaw" 93 and human eyes; he repeatedly erased and re-drew the 
car. On a roll of paper towels, in advance of the performance, 
he had painted the word "HELP" on each sheet, and during 
the performance he unrolled it like a scroll. 94 Hansen 
described Car Crash as sad because Dine 

packed it with the quiet anxiety of frustrated communication. . . . 
Dine . . . seemed to be choking. He was trying to tell us something; 
then he tried to write with fat chalk on a blackboard. The chalk 
kept breaking; he was trying too hard. It crumbled and the dust 
and chips came through his fingers, as he gurgled, trying so hard to 
communicate. Red chalk, then green chalk. I cried. 9S 

Dines soul-baring, ritualistic self-portrait posed a stark 
contrast not only with the Abstract Expressionists, who 
strove for universal myths of experience, but also with the 
apparent deadpan manner of the Pop artists. Nevertheless, 
beginning in 1962, curators and critics would align Dine's 
work with Pop art because of his emphasis on everyday 
objects and images, despite his gestural style. Dine 
maintained that "I'm not a Pop artist . . . I'm too subjective. 
Pop is concerned with exteriors. I'm concerned with interiors. 
When I use objects, I see them as a vocabulary of feelings." 96 
It is revealing to compare Dine's handling of the crash theme 
to the paintings by Pop artist Andy Warhol from his Death 
and Disasters series begun in 1962 (see fig. 11). Warhol's 
repetitive and dispassionate representation of an anonymous 
automobile accident simulates the barrage of violent images 
reproduced in the media. Warhol would say, "When you see 
a gruesome picture over and over again, it doesn't really have 
any effect." 97 The imperviousness to death and violence as 
well as the unemotive mechanical production of the surface 
of Warhol's paintings came to epitomize Pop art cool. In 
contrast, Dine was aptly characterized by Alan Solomon as a 
"hot artist in a cool time." 98 

The roles Dine wrote for the other performers in Car Crash 
were as emotionally fraught as his own. Pat Oldenburg's two- 
part monologue, which seems to be an improvised stream of 
consciousness, was in fact a precisely scripted speech by 
Dine. Seated high on a ladder, draped in white muslin and 
with her face painted white, Pat Oldenburg was a ghostly 
figure, appearing to levitate above the other players. Her 
utterances began, "The car in my life is a car with a pole in 
the harm of my soul which is a pretty clank . . . My car is my 
Hertz spot of love to zoom through the whole transmission of 
my lovely tire . . . " 99 After finishing this part of her 
monologue, she repeated it. Two minutes of "traffic sounds 
(crash)" followed, and then she called out the word "help" 
over and over, as the "Car" (Dine) unwound the roll of paper 
towels, on which the word "help" had been painted. Her 
erotic babble, laced with driving metaphors, seems to be a 
parody of the American postwar passion for automobiles. In 
the United States during that period, well-publicized 
statistics about highway deaths, as well as newspaper and 
television reports that revealed the dangers of fast driving, 
were countered by Hollywood films that idealized "heroes 
who drove wildly and experienced libidinous thrills and 



manly power at deadly speeds." 100 William Seitz, in the 
catalogue for the exhibition The Art of Assemblage (1961) at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New \brk, reproduced a photograph 
of Car Crash, pointing out: 

For the first time since the period of the futurists, the automobile 
. . . has been effectively dealt with by the plastic arts, but with 
an emotional tone that is not at all the same. By now, the 
automobile has become a mass killer, the upholstered love-boat 
of the adolescent, and the status symbol of the socially 
disenfranchised. . . . It is no longer delight with mechanization 
that is represented. . . . Dine . . . has dealt with the automobile as 
a symbol of love and death. "" 

In Dine's performance, the accident was simulated when 
Tersch and Ratliff, playing male and female cars respectively, 
bumped into Dine's "Car" and caught him in the beams of 
their flashlights; they also collided with each other, "always 
using one light on the sex organs, the other on the face."' 02 
Tersch wore a man's white pants, shirt, and tie, her hair in a 
ponytail and her face concealed by a sad-faced papier-mache 
mask. Ratliff, also masked, wore a low-cut woman's dress 
that revealed his dark chest hair. Marvin Carlson, in his 
recent survey of performance, points out that there is a 
"long . . . history of men playing women and women playing 
men within conventional theatre," as well as "within the 
tradition of popular performance such as vaudeville, 
burlesque, circus, and minstrelsy, {where} the man dressed as 
a woman {is} used for comic or grotesque effect."' 03 To Dine's 
audience, however, gender crossing would have suggested 
transgression against larger social and art-world norms. Even 
within avant-garde circles, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, 
male and female roles were rigidly defined. Only with the 
rise of the feminist and gay-rights movements, later in the 
decade, were gender roles more widely called into question. 104 

The grotesque image of the body is explored again in 
Dine's final theater work of i960, A Shining Bed (figs. 51-53) 
which was performed as part of a Christmas program of 
Happenings held at the Reuben Gallery in December. 10 ^ The 
audience was seated in darkness and clustered closely around 
a spotlit bed, like characters in a Nativity scene. With spikey 
bedposts covered in aluminum foil and decorated with 
Christmas lights, the bed literally shone. Dine lay on the bed 

as Santa Claus with a blue face and no beard, under the covers 
of the bed. I lay therefor a few minutes as if I were leaking up. 
while the music — The Chipmunks — was playing softly in the 
background. Then I quickly pulled a piece of polyethylene . . . over 
my face and made certain movements with a flashlight in my 
crotch very quickly. Throwing the plastic off. I sat up. went to the 
end of the bed on my knees, took batter out of a bowl, and put it all 
over the spikes. It was a repulsive situation. When that was over, 
I reached down with my head between my legs into a bowl of flour 
and pulled my face up quickly. It was white instead of blue. The 
lights went off. . . . From underneath my pillow. I pulled a gold 
baby doll and put it on the pillow. I disappeared. The Christmas- 
tree lights, which blinked, came on, and the Pales trina music on 78 
got very loud. The baby was just sitting there. Then it was over. 
That was my best {performance} — the one I liked best. It was the 
most beautiful one. '° 6 

Dine describes his performance in seemingly contradictory 
terms: as both "repulsive" and "beautiful." The images of the 
clown-faced Santa immersed in flour and the spotlit genitals 
exemplify Bakhtin's concept of the body in grotesque 
realism: "ugly, monstrous, hideous from the point of view of 



38 



'classic' aesthetics." 107 Such an emphasis on the "bodily lower 
stratum, the zone of genital organs," 108 subverts the classical 
canon, which gives precedence to the upper region of the 
head and to mental control over bodily action. Dine's 
grotesque images transgressed against the perceived high 
cultural ideal of the abstract and the spiritual, and instead 
stressed the concrete and the figurative. As such, the images 
of A Shining Bed wvrt so fundamentally liberating as to have 
anticipated aspects of body art and performance that would 
be explored by an increasing number of artists only a few 
years later. Sally Banes, in her history of the avant-garde in 
New York in the 1960s, observed that around [963 artists 
began to focus on explicitly visceral subjects that previously 

had been considered off limits and thus been concealed; 

she points to such performance works as Carolee 
Schneemann's Aleut Joy, 1964, for emphatically bringing them 
into public view."" Banes observed that "the body in the 
Fifties and early Sixties mainstream culture was almost 
always controlled and covered up" but that around 1963 "the 
avant-garde arts produced a new image — unruly, festively 
promiscuous, candid, and confident — that by the late Sixties 
had become the cultural norm."'" 

While not thematically linked to /\ Shining Bed, Dine's 
environment Rainbow Thoughts, shown at the Judson Gallery 
in January 1961, was visually related to the performance of 
the previous month. In both, there is a single, illuminated 
object at the center of a small, darkened space. One reviewer 
described Rainbow Thoughts as a place of quiet contemplation 
and self-reflection: 

Dines new "Environment" . . . is really a place to go and empty 
your mind. Once you register the fact of u small room washed down 
with black house paint, which you barely note before closing the 
door behind you. . . . there is just one thing left to . . . look at. 
Thut is the neat semi-circle of u rainbow suspended just above eye 
level and illumined by a dangling blinking light. . . . the blinker 
with rainbow has entered the reulm of assumed data . . . like the 
ticking heart. " 2 

The aesthetic of Rainbow 'Thoughts — completely lacking the 
expressionistic clutter of The House from the year before — 
was representative of Dine's new, pared-down style. The 
rainbow became one of Dine's signature objects, which he 
imbued with personal meaning and in late 1959 began to 
isolate on his canvases (in two- or three-dimensional form) 
against a single color ground.'" 

After A Shining Bed, Dine abandoned performance, with 
the exception of a one-time return in May of 1965, having 
been solicited by Alan Solomon to create a work to be 
presented as the opening event of the First Sew York Theater 
Rally. The rally, which showcased various kinds of theater 
(primarily Happenings and dance), was organized by 
Solomon together with Steve Paxton, a founding member of 
Judson Dance Theater." 1 Unlike Dine's earlier performances, 
his new work, Natural History (The Dreams) (figs. 138-40), 
was much longer (approximately forty-five minutes), slower- 
pa&lt; ed, and lacking the expressionistic exuberance of the 
earlier performances. Under a blinking tungsten lamp, Dine, 
wearing a black turtleneck, pants, and motorcycle boots, sat 
or paced silently. Throughout the performance, a tape 
recording played of Dine reading from a book of dreams he 
had written clown during the summer of 1963."' Four silent, 
dreamlike sequences were simultaneously acted out around 
him on the large, darkened stage; each of the tour groups oi 
performers were defined by a blinking lamp and carried out 
redundant, mundane activities:

The ritualistic movements — passing hand to hand, 
kneading, sawing, snacking — contributed to the hypnotic 
effect. Dine later said of this performance work: 

The images in the theater piece were only meant to supplement the 
voice . . . Probably if I had any nerve at all I would have just 
played the tape because the images were the most ephemeral part of 
it even though to me they were meaningful . . . The tape was 
powerful enough, I think a man's dreams of a summer . . . {are} so 
power jul . . . I trust so thoroughly the meat of . . . the 
unconscious. " 7 

Dines recital of dreams came at a time when he was 
intensely engaged in psychoanalysis." 8 Even the length of the 
performance was virtually the same as a psychoanalytic 
session." 9 Furthermore, it was the first performance where 
Dine is literally unmasked, as though the act of not wearing 
a mask is a way to reveal his inner self. 110 The acute focus on 
the self and on the psyche put Dines work in general — and 
this performance in particular — at odds with the 
contemporary art movements of Pop and Minimalism, as 
well as with the more psychologically restrained work of the 
Judson Dance Theater, which dominated the New York 
Theater Rally. 11 ' 

Natural History (The Dreams) was a critical failure. Dine 
was well aware that the personal nature of his work made it 
untenable for much of his audience in the mid-1960s: 

/ used exposure of myself as a medium . . . I knew people wouldn't 
like it. they'd say they were bored . . . when they meant they were 
nervous, and they didn't want to hear it . . . They said things like 
"We don't icant to see his problems" . . . but I believe that exposure 
can be used as a medium and I was . . . totally pleased with what 
I did. it was completely successful because it was about exposing 
yourself. Making it difficult for the audience through exposure. 
Asking them to relate to you rather than you relating to them. !22 

"fet for Carolee Schneemann, whose own work of the 1960s 
proved to be formative, particularly for feminist 
performances of the following decade, Dines Natural History 
(The Dreams) was a revelatory experience. At the time, she 
was a member of Judson Dance Theater and she recalled: 

Dine (was) the first man to use explicitly personal material — his 
psychoanalytic tape, uncensored self-exposure . . . just the voice in 
the dark. The audience didn't approve of that much actuality! A 
turning point for me. He had stripped it all down to bare desire, 
anger, the lived life. Audience didn't get it or couldn't stand it. ,2i 

More recently, Schneemann has said of the audience response 
to Dines performance: "The negative reaction is what 
prepares the territory for what's going to come next. These 
are signal works. These occur in a kind of physical- 
psychological space that hasn't been occupied in our culture 
before."' 24 

Hxposure of the self, in the early and mid- 1960s had 
isolated Dine from his peers; by the end of the decade, 
however, it had become standard fare in artist-made 
performances. While Natural 1 1 '/story (The Dreams) was

Notes 

i. After a nearly four-and-a-half-year In. mis, Dine did one final 
performance, Natural History (Tht Dreams), which was parr &lt;&gt;l the First 
New York Theater Rail) in May 1965. Dine frequently uses the term 
"painter's theater"; for example, see Dine quoted in Caroline Windish- 
Graetz, "It Happened," The New York Herald Tribune, Maj j, 1965, p 24, 
The term "Happening" was tirsi used tor this knul oi work lor a score 
written in 1958 by Allan Kaprow, (.ailed "something to take place: 
a happening," and published in the Rutgers University Anthologist jo, 
no. 4 (Spring 1959). Letter from Kaprow to art critic Jill Johnston, 
January 24, 1962; the letter is in the Jean Brown archives at the Getty 
Center for the History ot Art and The I lumanities, Los Angeles. 

2. Joseph Ruzicka's "Jim Dine and Performance" — published in American 

Art qftht 1960s (New York: The Museum ol Modern Art, 1991), 
pp.97— 121 — has been the only comprehensive overview ot Dines 
performance works to date. In the present cssa\, I have tin used only on 
Dines own performances, and on his environments — both those related 
and those that .ire unrelated to the performances — and have not 
considered his partic ipation in other theater works, either as a performer 
or, later, as a stage ami costume designer. Ruzicka provides an in-depth 
analysis of Dines stage and costume designs tor a 1966 production of 
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night'i Dream at the San Francisco Actor's 
Workshop and of his designs done in 1967-68 for a production (never 
staged) of Oscar Wilde's Tht Picturt oj Dorian Gray. See also William S. 
Lieberman, ed.,Jim Dun: A tigns for A Midsummer Night'i Dream, with

Press, 1968), a limited-edition book of lithographs and etchings. 

3. The Judson Gallery, located in the basement of the Judson Memorial 
Church, 2?9 Thompson Street, near Washington Square South, was 
started in February [959 through the efforts ol Marcus Ratliff, Dine, and 
others, under the leadership of the church's associate minister, Bernard E. 
("Bud") Scott. Dine was also included in Neu Media New Forms and 
Neu Media - Sat Forms,Version -' at the Martha Jackson Gallery, 32 East 
69th Street, June 6-24 and September 27— October 22, i960, 
respectively; these were large group exhibitions of mixed-media works 
(made primarily from "junk" materials) by more than seventy artists, 
most ot them contemporary, but with a few historical examples (such as 
Hans Arp ami Kurt Schwitters). In the Preface to the catalogue for the 
first exhibition (published atter it closed; there was no catalogue for the 
Second one), Martha Jackson wrote of the huge public response to the 
show, in attendance and in the media, which included both press and 
television coverage. Although a condensed version ot Kaprow's then 
forthcoming book. Assemblage, Environments &amp; Happenings (New York: 
Harry N. Abrams, ca. 1966), was included in the exhibition catalogue 
and introduced the concept of environments, it was not until the 
Environments - Situations - Spaces exhibition at the Martha Jackson and 
David Anderson galleries (May 25 -June 23, 1961) that environments were 
showcased uptown; this exhibition was much more selective, featuring 
only six artists: George Brecht, Dine, Walter Gaudnek, Kaprow, Claes 
Oldenburg, and Robert Whitman.

and Happenings, often in highly visible publications, would sometimes 
combine an awareness ot the slunk value ot these works with a sense that 
they were also entirely new and worthy of notice. For example, Suzanne 
Kiplinger in her review tor Tht Villagt Voiceot Dine and Oldenburg's 
joini exhibition ot environments, Ray-Gun, in the winter ot [960, 
remarked that 'Ray-Gun' ... is one of those things which produces 
paroxysms ot rage in too many beholders. They can't take it or leave it 
alone, but feel it must lie stamped out immediately or civilization 
will be in peril." She continues, however, by stating that "it you sink 
around tor a while and give it a c haine. I think you'll end by admiring 
the idea . . . this form — that ot art enveloping the viewer-might go 
places" (p. 11). While a Timi magazine review ot early environments and 
Happenings stated that "real children might do it better" ("Up-Beats," 
7/wi, March 14, i960, p. Ho), Rosalind Constable, a cultural correspondent 
at Time, countered in an unpublished memo that while these- comments 
are not without truth (they ./&gt;'&lt; messy, and thoroughly contusing to the 
uninitiated) the tact remains that these 'Happenings' haw been the most 
talked about off-beat art event ot the season" (p. 6). Constable's memo,

rules that Kaprow established retrospectively for the Happenings — for 
example, that there should be no distinction between performance and 
audience, that Happenings should only take place once, or that there 
should be no rehearsals for the Happenings — were not strictly followed 
by Dine and most other artists associated with the Happenings. 
Kaprow's guidelines for Happenings are outlined in his article "The 
Happenings Are Dead — Long Live the Happenings," Artforum (Los 
Angeles) 4, no. 7 (March 1966), pp. 36 — 39.

(New York) 60, no. 3 (May 1961), p. 39. 

23. Kaprow, in his letter to Jill Johnston from January 24, 1962 (see n. 1, 
above), wrote that he "attended the class with profit during '57 and '58 
and visited it frequently during '59." 

24. Antonin Artaud's collection of essays The Theatre and Its Double, 
was first translated from his native French into English in 1958 and was 
widely read by this generation of artists. His theories were particularly 
influential for Cage and his students. Artaud argued for a visceral 
theater that would serve as a kind of psychological catharsis for the 
audience, a theater emphasizing myth and dreams; to accomplish this, 
he used dramatic lighting and de-emphasized language, instead 
stressing human noises such as screams and groans. As Kaprow 
advocated for the Happenings, Artaud encouraged a dissolution of the 
space that traditionally separates actors and audience. 

25. For more on Cage's class, see Robyn Brentano, "Outside the Frame: 
Performance, Art, and Life," in Outside the Frame: Performance and the 
Object. A Survey History of Performance Art in the USA since 1950 to the 
Present (Cleveland: Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, 1994), 
pp. 35—37. Although Dine is often cited as having regularly visited 
Cage's class, he told me in a conversation on August 13, 1998, that he 
never attended. Moreover, Cage emphasized the element of chance, 
which played such a significant role in Dada and in the work of Kaprow, 
but would not have appealed to Dine. Cage's class, however, did bring 
performance to the forefront of art-making practices. In addition to 
Kaprow, many of the artists who came to be associated with Happenings 
as well as with Fluxus, such as George Brecht, Al Hansen, and Dick 
Higgins, did attend Cage's class. Happenings and Fluxus were both part 
of the international art scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where the 
emphasis shifted from the finite art object to the performing body and 
the act of creation itself, as in Gutai in Japan and Nouveau Realisme in 
France. 

26. An advertisement for the Ray-Gun exhibition ran in the January 27, 
i960 edition of The Village Voice (p. 11); here, the opening date for both 
The House and The Street was stated as January 30. According to the 
"Spring Calendar at the Judson Gallery" put out by the "Raygun 
Deputies, Jim Dine [and] Claes Oldenburg," the original intention was 
that The House would open first on January 30 and The Street would not 
open until March 5; However, the installation of The Street was certainly 
well under way by February 29, the first evening of the Ray Gun Spex 
program of Happenings that included Oldenburg's Snapshots from the 
City, which was performed in Oldenburg's The Street. Although the exact 
dates of the Ray-Gun exhibition are not definitive, the "Spring Calendar" 
indicates that construction of The House was scheduled to begin on 
January 4 and that the gallery space would be open to the public 
throughout the installation, and that the end date for the exhibition 
would be March 23. A copy of the "Spring Calendar at the Judson 
Gallery" is in the archives at the Judson Memorial Church.

lisi Kaprow as one of the panelists, although the transcript reveals that 
he was oik ol the discussants. The transcript begins with one of the 
panel organizers introducing Dine, Kaprow, Oldenburg, and Johnson, 
with Johnson described as "one of the only men who has repeatedly 
combined the actions I u t 1 painting with the figure." 



35. Oldenburg stated, "Expressionists — I had the feeling they avoid the 
people. My aim is not exclusive. I would like to reach as many people as 
possible." Dine followed by saying, "I want them {the audience] to be 
reached immediately and know they are being reached." Transcript of

(London) 190, no. 977 (Septembet/October 1975), p. 121, coined the term 
"habitable sculpture" to describe this kind of environment. 

42. For Reiss, environments are distinguished from Happenings by their 
"lack of human presence other than the viewer." I am more in agreement 
with Kaprow that "the differences [between environments and 
Happenings] will eventually blur and matter less," as this example of the 
"inhabited" House supports; Reiss, "From Margin to Center," 

p. 22; the original source for the Kaprow quote is from Assemblage. 
Environments &amp; Happenings, p. 185. Ray Gun Spex, an evening of Hap-

Oldenburg's Snapshots from the City (performed in and thematically 
linked to The Street), Dick Higgins's Edifaces Cabarets Contributions, 
Al Hansen's Projections, Kaprow's Coca Cola, Shirley Cannonball, Red 
Grooms's The Big Leap, and Robert Whitman's Duet for a Small Smell.

figurative subjects, is often cited by Dine as among the artists he 
admired most. 

46. See Reiss, "From Margin to Center," p. 72. 

47. Ruzicka traces the lineage of Dines environments to his mixed- 
media works from the previous year, using the example of his Household 
Piece from 1959. Ruzicka points out that the "irregular shape" of this 
piece "break[s] from the rigid corners and edges of the traditional 
rectangular format. The natural next step, then, was to transform, both 
spatially and emotionally, the white walls of an entire room." Ruzicka, 
"Jim Dine and Performance," p. 98. 

48. Drucker, "Collaboration without Object(s)," pp. 53, 56. This was 
reinforced when Dine and Oldenburg made play money on a stencil 
machine and handed out one million dollars to each member of the 
Ray Gun Spex audience so that they could buy junk objects during the 
intermission. Haskell, Blam! , p. 37. 

49. See Kenneth E. Silver, "Modes of Disclosure: The Construction of 
Gay Identity and the Rise of Pop Art," in Hand-Painted Pop: American 
Art in Transition 1955—62 (Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, 
and New York: Rizzoli International Publications, 1992), especially 
pp. 201 — 02. Silver states that "the trope of the 'anti-domestic' was 
inscribed in the discourse of Abstract Expressionism by at least the early 
1950s, if not sooner." Silver cites as an example Robert Goodnough's 
"Pollock Paints a Picture"(/W News {New York] 50, no. 3 {May 1951], 

pp. 38—41, 60—61), in which Goodnough emphasizes Pollock's 
connection to the out-of-doors and the American West. According to 
Silver, this "excessive need to insist upon the wide-open expanses of the 
virilizing American landscape, the need to affirm what is neither 
domestic or commercial, is precisely the same need which so many Pop 
artists . . . took such pleasure in parodying." Other Pop artists who 
mined the interiors of the house for subjects for their work included 
Oldenburg — beginning with his streamlined, room-scale Bedroom 
Ensemble, 1963 — as well as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Tom 
Wesselmann. Although by 1962 Dine was no longer making site-specific 
environments or incorporating previously used materials or objects in 
his works, he returned to domestic subjects in what were essentially 
environmental paintings, representing kitchens, bathrooms, children's 
rooms, and living rooms. These are large-scale, sometimes multi-panel 
canvases which became "the wall of each room" with new household 
objects attached to their surface. In her review of the exhibition held at 
Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, February 4-March 2, 1963, Jill Johnston 
(in "Jim Dine," Art News {New York] 62, no. 1 [March 1963], p. 14) called

this "[Dines] project of interior decoration." When several of the 
environmental paintings from 1962 were shown in Thi Popular Imagt 
Exhibition, held at the Washington Gallery of Modern Art. Washington, 
D.C., April 18-June 2, 1961 as part of the Pop Art Festival staged by the 
gallery, a reviewer reported that "confused guests sat down on the 
armchair that was part ol Four Roomi . . . and piled champagne glasses 
into the porcelain sink . . . that is part of . . . Black Bathroom No. 2"; 
"Happenings: Pop Culture," Timt (New York), May |, [963, p. 73. Four 
Rooms is illustrated in fig. 109 of the present catalogue, and Black

Jean E. Feinberg, Dim (New York: Abbeville Press Publishers, 1995), 
pp. 15-16; Schimmel, Leap into the Void," p. 66. Schimmel asserts 
that the action of jumping through the paper "canvas" is "no doubt in 
homage to Murakami," referring to the Japanese Gutai artist Murakami 
Saburo who in the mid-1950s was making ephemeral environments out 

01 paper screens, through which he threw his body. Gutai activities were 
known to some members of the New York art world, particularly 
through an article entitled "Japanese Innovators" by Ray Falk in the 
Sunday New York Times (December cS, 1 9 s ~ , Section 2, p. 24) and an 
exhibition held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in October 1958. While 
Dine was aware of the exhibition at Martha Jackson, he was not familiar 
with Murakami's performance works (conveyed to me by Dine in our 
conversation on August 13, [998). Similarities between their works were, 
most likely, the result of a broad trend that was emerging in the mid- 
1950s to the early 1960s among international artists who challenged 
Abstract Expressionism and sought out alternatives to painting by- 
employing their bodies in performance pieces and other actions.

54. In Dines performance works and many of the early Happenings, 
the act of making art — usually painting — was integrated into the 
performance. For example, according to Barbara Moore, Grooms's first 
performance in 1958 consisted of the artist painting before an audience, 
and Kaprow's 18 Happenings in 6 Parts included several artists painting;

71. Dine, from his own description of Spring Cabinet in the- exhibition 
catalogue (Environments Situation* Spaces [New York: Martha Jackson 
Gallery, 1961] n.p.). Here he indicates that green was chosen because of 
its associations with springtime: "The spring cabinet is meant to be verj 
green and much like a color-value of this time ot year." The gallery, 
however, did not allow the green paint to ilnp as Dine had intended; see 
the review "Jumping on Tires," Newsweek (June 12, 1961), p. 92, and Al 
Hansen's description in his Primer of Happenings, p. 68. Dine explained in 
our conversation on August 13, 1998, that he therefore pre-painted the 
palette-shaped canvas, using many colors; this is evident in eolor slides 
of the installation taken by Robert McElroy.

Intermission Piece; Richard Maxfield's Electronic Music, George Brecht's 
Gosoon; and Robert Whitman's, E.G. , an opera in which Dine was part of 
the cast. Dine's performance piece is usually referred to as Vaudeiilh 
Show (see, for example, Rimcka,_//w Dint and Performance, p. 99). 
However, on the typed announcement from the Reuben Gallery, it is 
called Vaudevillt Act and on the program from the evening it is listed as 
Vaudeville Collage; the stage- set itself had a sign that read "Jim Dine's

was linked to the music hall in not only content but also structure. He 
argues that the cutting and pasting, w Inch brings together Otherwise 
unrelated sources on the surface of a collage, is comparable to the 
"structural principle of the music-hall revut . . [where] the jumbling 
and splicing of current events . . . occur in rapid succession anel [with]

evoke in such a description the intensity of the audience's response, 
which was electrifying; Dine on stage had a charismatic effect which 
depended on the intensity of his projection of himself and the activities

Ruzicka, "Jim Dine and Performance," pp. 100, 118, n. 23. 

81. The performance took place at the new Reuben Gallery space at 44 
East 3rd Street, where Dine had his studio upstairs. He had found the 
space for Reuben, and according to the press release for this performance 
and several following it, the 1960 — 61 season was devoted "exclusively to a 
series of evening exhibitions of art in a new medium. A workshop for 
'happenings' has been created by the artists who last year began to 
explore this new form." The fifteen-to-twenty-minute performance 
(Kirby, Happenings, p. 199) of Car Crash was held six times, from 
November 1 to 6, and with no other performances appearing on those 
evenings. The press release is reproduced in Happening &amp; Fluxus, n.p.

85. The car accidents on which the performance was partially based have 
been reported differently in various written accounts. Dine, in our 
conversation on August 13, 1998, clarified the sequence of events: The 
first accident occurred in Kentucky. Dine was at the wheel when he 
heard the news on the radio that his college roommate had died in a car 
accident. At the same moment, a bee flew in the window and stung 
Dine, and he lost control of the car and went through the windshield. 
Another accident happened a month later, when he was driving with 
Nancy (his wife) and their infant son to see Nancy's parents in 
Cleveland; Dine swerved the car, and Nancy reached back to secure the 
baby in the car bed and broke her arm.

suffering" can include, for example, repetitive physical actions and 
"whimpering, sobbing, and other sounds of distress." While Hansen 
found Car Crash to be sad, he described having run into Dick Higgins in 
the lobby, who was "drying his eyes, . . . [saying] Wasn't that funny? It 
was so funny!'" Hansen, pp. 30 — 31.

of Assemblage was an important exhibition for bringing art-world 
attention to assemblage; however, it overlooked 

the mixed-media works of many young, lesser-known contemporary 
American artists of that period, including Dine, as well as Oldenburg, 
Grooms, and Whitman; see Livingstone, Jim Dine: Alchemy, p. 118, n. 23. 

102. Ruzicka discusses Dines complex use of lighting in this performance, 
combining flashlights, spotlights, and houselights for dramatic effect. 
Ruzicka, "Jim Dine and Performance," pp. 103 — 04. Dine, in his 
interview with Barbaralee Diamonstein (in Inside New York's Art World 
[New York: Rizzoli, 1979), p. 98], discusses how he, Oldenburg, and 
Grooms were doing "a kind of expressionist theatre . . . influenced by 
early films." He goes on to say that Grooms was particularly impressed 
by the German Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), 
directed by Robert Wiene. The use of spotlighting on white figures in an 
essentially dark stage set in that film seems comparable to Dines use 

of light in Car Crash. There are numerous other visual similarities 
between Dine's Car Crash and this film, including the prevalence of 
crosses, the use of masks, integration of the written word with visual 
images, and the Expressionist stage set.

social and cultural climate that has come to be associated with the 1960s 
as a decade began only in 1963. A counterculture in the art world 
developed against a highly charged social and political landscape, which 
in that year included the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the civil- 
rights march in Washington, D.C., and the stepped-up involvement of 
the U.S. in Vietnam (pp. 1-2). Based on Bakhtin's concept of the 
grotesque and the work of the British anthropologist Mary Douglas, 
Banes coins the term "effervescent grotesque body" to describe these 
visceral works that "poke holes in the decorum and hegemony of official 
culture" (p. 192).

Walking Memory 

A Conversation with Jim Dine, Clare Bell, andGermano Celant 

Clare Bell: I remember reading once that you said "to paint 
was a compulsion." Did that compulsion go all the way back 
to your childhood? 

Jim Dine: I painted since I was two years old. I've always 
painted. It's what saved me. It was my way of speaking 
through the black times. 

Germano Celant: What kind of painting did you do as a 
child? Nature studies' Still lifes? 

JD: I was not making childish paintings. I was trying to 
depict nature or to depict still life, or in the third grade 
when we were studying China, I remember trying my best to 
make a watercolor of a Chinese man in a blue suit, a worker's 
suit, and trying so hard to draw it right. And it was always a 
struggle, a struggle to get my hands to work, and I am left- 
handed. In those days, you know, we had penmanship 
classes, and I smeared my writing every single time because 
my hand would drag across the page. Because that's the way 
a left-handed person writes. 

CB: As a child would you try to render a mirror image' 
JD: I was trying to achieve a relationship between my eyes 
and my hand. And it wasn't working. It took me a long time. 
It was like weight lifting. I had to practice. 
GC: Besides grammar school, where were you drawing.' 
Were you going to some special place' 

JD: It was always in my house and when I was eleven, I went 
to the art museum in our town, and studied with a man who 
was a Mexican-American veteran of the Second World War 
and wanted to be an artist. He taught at the Art Academy. 
His name was Carlos Cervantes. 
CB: Did your parents encourage your art studies? 
JD: My mother was a "culture vulture" and had a lot of 
ambition for me, and she thought it was great. My father, on 
the other hand, never thought much about my interest in art 
and let me go to the museum simply because he thought it 
brought some kind of social prestige to our family. 
GC: So your mother was your point of cultural reference? 
JD: She was my muse. 
CB: Did you ever draw her.' 

JD: No. My mother was the woman who lit the flame. My 
grandma was my mother; my mother was my lover. It was 
like that. It was a complicated, confused childhood. 
CB: Where were your grandparents from!' 
JD: My father's parents were from Lithuania. My mother's 
father was from Poland, and her mother was Hungarian. She 
wasn't from Hungary — her mother was. She was actually- 
born in Richmond, Virginia, but she was a woman of 
Europe, a peasant farm woman. 

GC: Did they show you images of the past' Their country? 
Did they bring with them memories of those places? 
JD: That's all we ever spoke about. We only spoke about 
memories. 

CB: Had your grandparents lost family in the Holocaust? 
JD: No, we all came over before the war. My grandfather 
came at the end of the nineteenth century, as an indentured 
man to a cousin, who brought him over, and then he owed 
him tor years. 

CB: What kind of jobs did you have growing up? 
JD: When I was in high school, I worked at construction in 
the summer time building houses. I watched carpenters a 
lot. I had always watched plumbers particularly. You know, 
there is something about how plumbing is done, wh.u 
plumbing is about. The bowels, the underground of things. 
To be a plumber now is to be rather clean. You use plastu 



pipe. Its put together with glue, it's no problem. It's cut 
easily. 'lb be a plumber when I was growing Up you had to be 
somebody. In the first place, you an- Lifting pipes. You're 
lifting a sewer pipe that was cast iron. We called it soil 
pipe." And every summer at my uncles store, working there. 
I had to lift those things oft trucks. It was really, realh tough 
work. Then, being a plumber was tough work, because to put 
that together, a piece of pipe together, there was a male and 
female end, you put that male end to the female, and then 
you packed it like a tooth cavity with oakum, which is hemp 
soaked in tar, and you packed that around it and then they 
melted the lead and poured the lead and sealed it. To have 
been a plumber meant digging in shit all the time. It 
smelled terrible. I mean, to be around plumbers, they always 
stunk like shit, and my father, because he worked in a tool 
store, we all knew how to do this, but the toilet would get 
stuffed up or the drain would get stuffed up, my father 
would bring out the snake, shove it down there and brum U P 
crap from the thing. It was disgusting, but this all had 
something to do with how art is made. The same way my 
grandma put together meals in some sort of intuitive way. It 
was the same thing. It was this putting together of things. 
GC: So do you think that your work is about memory too? 
JD: My work is totally about memory. And my memory is 
very good. I mean I have a very vague memory of everything. 
There were times when I could remember everything that 
ever happened to me. And I can't anymore, but I relish my 
memory, I cherish my memory. My memory is my vast vault 
of experience. 

CB: It's not a selective memory' 

JD: No. Absolutely not. 1 don't want to control it. It's all 
there. 

GC: It's life memory, which is why I feel your work is so 
aligned with European ideologies. Your subject matter is 
difficult, because memories are something you don't want to 
remove. 

JD: They want to remove them in America. 
GC: That is why I feel your acceptance in Europe is stronger 
in some ways, because our goal as Europeans is memory, and 
you always bring your bag of memory full on your back. And 
that I understand, and also why you so adamantly refused 
being labeled a Pop artist. It was offensive. 
JD: It had no romance. For me it was just what it was. I need 
the romance. 

GC: You needed the flexibility of time and history. 
CB: Materials, patterns, and textures, which were so clearly 
important to your early work, are imbued with an air of 
domesticity as opposed to a laconic manufactured quality. 
What was it about the house or home itself that inspired 
you.' 

JD: We lived in houses with basements. I was always in the 
basement, going through the old paint cans, using the old 
paint — and just stirring the- old paint turned me on! It was 
some connection between shit and food and paint. As a child, 
it had to be like that. 
GC: Would you paint on am surface? 
JD: 1 painted sometimes on the- basement con&lt; re tc wall, or 
I'd paint on a paint stirrer, or I'd make designs. I didn't know 
the word "collage." I'd make designs. My aunt has ,i painting 
that I made in high school after I had discovered Nicolas de 
Stael. I loved de Stael because- he- was a romantic figure and I 
loved the way he put the paint on so thick. It looked to me 
like modern art. Eventually, when I left home, and ran awa\ 
from the evil stepmother and went to live with my grandma, 
I worked in her basement and painted on anything I could 
find. I knew a rich girl 1 went to high school with, who I

liked and she liked me, and she took me to her grandma's 
huge mansion in Cincinnati, and we went to the basement 
and there I saw her grandmother's canvases. So, I took away a 
lot of canvases of very bad paintings of people, and I painted 
over them. 

CB: So the basement operated as something secret and 
liberating as well as abject and furtive? 
JD: It's been in my dreams all my life. My whole 
unconscious is depicted as a house, and the basement is 
where it takes place, and then you go upstairs. 
GC: What kind of formal art training did you have after 
high school? 

JD: I was untrainable. I went to the University of Cincinnati 
just because I didn't want to go into the army, and I hated it. 
There were no art classes there to speak of. Then I found out 
that I could go to Ohio University, which also had few art 
classes, but you could get a degree in it. It was very cheap — 
eighty-five dollars a semester. I had no money, but my 
grandma could pay that for me, and I worked in the summer. 
But I never went to classes. All I did was paint at Ohio 
University, and they were frightened of me. They never had 
anybody like that, because mostly everybody wanted to be an 
art teacher. 

CB: Where did you paint at college? 

JD: My apartment or in the school. The school had rooms, 
but they were hardly used, and I painted like crazy all the 
time. And I got through it. I cheated, and got through 
college. 

CB: Did you receive any formal instruction? 
JD: There were instructors, but they treated me like an 
equal. Some were threatened by me, some were excited by 
me. But I was nineteen years old, and they were thirty-five 
and sixty. I just painted. 

CB: In 1955 you enrolled for one semester at the School of the 
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Why did you want to go to 
Boston? 

JD: When I graduated from high school I gave myself a 
present. I bought a book called Modern Prints and Drawings 
by Paul Sachs, who was at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum. I 
still have that book. And I thought, well Boston must be the 
place to go, so I went to the Museum School for a semester. It 
was horrible. It was like the army — rigorous, old-fashioned, 
academic training that I didn't want. What made me 
different from other artists — not that every artist isn't 
different — but what set me apart is that my subject matter 
was myself. 

CB: Had the figure played an important role in your work 
prior to your coming to New York? 

JD: Well, I was fairly glib with my hands — that is, I could 
draw a self-portrait of myself and make it look like myself, 
which in New York seemed terribly radical and no one 
wanted to do it, because it wasn't so an courant. After the year 
I spent in Patchogue teaching school, which was 1958-59, I 
would come into the city three or four times a week, a two- 
hour ride each way at night after teaching school, and talk 
and drink with Claes [Oldenburg] and Red Grooms and see 
Lester Johnson. The art of Lester Johnson was really 
important to me. His paintings were so beautiful. It was like 
pulling out of the canvas, out of oil paint, out of material, 
out of sand, out of shit, out of tar — pulling it out, pulling 
out an image. Out of somewhere else rather than out of 
France, or rather than out of Rothko. That kind of refinement. 
CB: Were you involved with the unconscious? 
JD: Well, I didn't know it, but of course I was. I have pretty 
good access to my unconscious — that's the way I was born, 
and painting for me has helped me undemonize myself. So,

you could say it's cathartic what I do. But fortunately, I am a 
conscious enough person to have not just been a lunatic, and 
I've tried to elevate my desire to work to what I call art. 
CB: Did you feel that Abstract Expressionism gave you, on 
some level, permission to work with the unconscious? 
JD: I felt I always had access. 
GC: So it's very primitive. 

JD: I am not a heavily defensed person. I have an access to 
my childhood that many people are jealous of. I can access 
childhood very easily. I don't mean just memory. I mean 
feeling. And I am very much in the head of the child — not 
that I am childish, but in the sense that I remember and that 
my childhood stayed with me. When I started to toddle 
around and look at the world, I started to catalogue and 
accumulate in my mind experiences and sensations. I 
remember when I was maybe three years old, sitting with my 
mother's emery boards and taking a pencil and making a 
whole emery board black. I wear down the pencil for no 
reason other than the physical thing of making the emery 
board black. Then, I get the idea. I realize the sensuality of 
graphite. I touch it, and it's beautiful. Graphite is silvery, and 
I use it for makeup. And I put on a mustache and a beard, 
and I start to literally paint. The same with my mother's 
makeup. I was always in my mother's places — in the closet, 
under her bed, in her bathroom — playing with stuff. I was 
painting. I was experiencing changing something. 
CB: Are the faces you painted early in your career 
[figs. 18-22] an attempt to confront the demons of your 
childhood? 

JD: The faces were generic faces. They were me. They were 
me getting the emotion out of me. I began them the summer 
after I taught school in Patchogue when I used to come in to 
New York City all the time and see Red Grooms, and I was 
being introduced to people from the Hansa Gallery, which I 
didn't feel very comfortable with, but I was sort of affected 
by. Like Lester Johnson, and things Claes and I talked about. 
And then I went down to Kentucky, where my uncle had a 
little cabin on a lake in the midst of tobacco fields. And 
Nancy and I had a little boy, who was just a baby then. We 
went down to Kentucky, because we had no money, but it 
was a cheap place to live, and we stayed down there and I 
took watercolors and crayons and whatever, and I just started 
to draw faces. And every day I drew faces. And the whole 
summer I'd make a face a day, or two faces a day, and the 
more faces I made, the happier I was. There were so many of 
them. And then I started to make paintings down there. And 
by the end of the summer that's what I had, and I left a lot of 
them there. I brought back some of the drawings and showed 
them at the Reuben Gallery, in the back room. They were all 
pinned up, maybe thirty of them, and Dick Tyler took wine 
at an opening and threw it all over half of them, and I hit 
him. It was an incredible scene. 

GC: To me, the faces represent an osmosis between the 
personal and the idea of repetition, the personal being a 
representation of yourself and repetition the idea of a copy. 
Your work is thus both an integration and association of 
many levels of perception. Tell us about the idea of the mask 
and the theatrical elements of your early work. Did you know 
about Bertolt Brecht and the Living Theater? 
JD: I always thought of myself as an actor/artist, and I 
could've always been that, except I am not very good at 
interpreting others' work. I don't get any pleasure from that 
particularly, although I have appeared as an actor at times, 
besides the Happenings. And I've enjoyed that, and I could 
still be an actor today. I enjoy that! I enjoy looking at actors, 
watching actors. I don't enjoy the theater particularly, but I

enjoy the craft of what one can do. 

CB: Were you involved in acting prior to i960 when you first 

performed at Judson? 

JD: I did a little bit in high school, but more than that I 

made my own theater in my head and it had to do with all 

sorts of things. It had to do with growing up with a 

grandfather who was highly amusing for us kids. He was 

obviously a brute, and an abuser of a lot of things. But he 

was great fun as a grandfather. And it was theatrical. My 

mother was totally theatrical. Everything was a mass-drama, 

and it was very sad, because she said she was going to die, 

and she did die. You know, she said she was going to get the 

cancer, and she got the cancer. But it was done in such a 

flowery, theatrical way, and I was part of the team, part of 

the show that was going on. And also my experience with 

God, and in the synagogue. And the dichotomy of that — 

where I came from these people who were first-generation 

Americans, who wanted to leave their Orthodox Judaism 

behind. So we went to this Reform Temple, which was like 

Episcopal Church, but even less devout, more like 

Protestants. And all it did for me was make me feel two 

ways. My mother was ashamed of being Jewish, and on the 

other hand, my grandfather cried in the synagogue. I come 

from a strong God; a Jew comes from a strong, cruel God — 

Yahweh. And every night, I thought he was going to strike 

me down if I didn't say my prayers. My grandma told me, 

"You got to say your prayers, or he is going to punish you." 

And there is a lot of theater in that. The only time I ever 

enjoyed going to the synagogue was when there was a lot of 

music and they brought out the Torah, and everybody 

paraded around with these beautiful objects. I got into that. 

Otherwise, it was a nightmare for me. And of course, in the 

end, it was a nightmare because as a twelve-year-old, I had to 

stand up for the memorial service after my mother died, and 

that was an embarrassment to me, and I didn't know how to 

behave. All this informed me as a performer. 

GC: So, your acting comes from inside. There is a process of 

your inside becoming a gesture, an action, or a visual element. 

JD: Taking an unconscious thought and bringing it to 

consciousness. 

GC: And that's why the mask is the second skin of your face, 

which comes out of performing as a jester or an actor. 

JD: I think it's like a miracle. One of the things I like about 

Jesus is that Jesus's existence makes God conscious. It's the 

first time we talk about God as man, God in man. I relate to 

it so much. It didn't seem absurd to me, but rather a great 

moment. 

CB: Because it made something that seemed abstract into 

something tangible? 

JD: Yes, making something tangible. 

CB: So that's why you liked the part of the service when they 

brought out the Torah. 

JD: You got to see something. I love an object! I am obsessed 

with objects — I mean every object. I spent my whole life 

playing with objects. I was two years old, playing with every 

tool, every object I found. My grandmother's sewing kit, the 

basket of thread with every different color. My father's 

condoms; in those days, Ramses and Trojans came in 

packages that had beautiful drawings. Playing cards, the 

backs of playing cards. The beautiful ivory tiles used in the 

Chinese game of Mah-Jongg, which are like dominoes but 

with Chinese marks on them instead of dots. My mother's 

sense of decor in the house. 

CB: Does The Checkerboard '[July 1959, fig. 20] come out of 

your interest in games like this? 

JD: The checkerboard doesn't come from my thing with 



52 



games, it comes from what red and black look like together. 

I've always loved red and black, and it's a very basic pattern. 

CB: Was it specifically the grid that interested you, or the 

notion of pattern in general? 

JD: The grid, that's partly it. 1 like the square thing, but tor 

instance, in Scottish tartans, which 1 am a big student of, 

there is one called Rob Roy. So it goes back to the eighteenth 

century and probably even before. I've been interested in 

tartan all my life. It thrills me. 

GC: I noticed that the imagery in Altar for Jeremiah [1959, 

fig. 24], is much more complicated than the first face 

paintings. 

JD: But it's also very ordered, in an altar kind of way. 

CB: In fact, the overall shape of the piece is reminiscent of a 

crucifix. 

JD: I always loved a central image. And although Altar for 

Jeremiah is quite sophisticated in technique, the imagery is 

more like primitive painting than something out of Abstract 

Expressionism. There is this huge penis in plaster, and some 

of the objects are found Halloween masks. All of us were 

fascinated with just about everything in the city, even with 

someone ejaculating on the subway. It was like collecting an 

experience in this underworld. We were collecting another 

experience of someone making their mark a different way, of 

someone being crazy, of walking down the street looking just 

like everyone else and then being able to do this to make 

themselves individuals. It was like lifting up a rock and 

discovering all these worms. It was really great! 

CB: Was Halloween an inspiration to your work.-' 

JD: Halloween in Ohio, when I was a child in the late 1930s, 

scared the shit out of me. And my mother and father were 

embarrassed by me crying when kids in costumes came to 

our house on Halloween. It's the frightening masks of 

pumpkins for heads, it's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," it's 

the headless rider, and it's also listening to adventure serials 

on the radio and being scared. I still love looking at masks 

and things. Puppets, masks — all that interests me. 

CB: Does chance play a role in any of these works? 

JD: When I heard Kaprow and John Cage talking about 

chance, I thought to myself, "What? This is like reinventing 

the wheel. An artist does that every day!" When Whistler 

put down a brushstroke, was it chance? Since you have the 

opportunity to remove it after it's done. We're free men. But, 

it's always been there for artists. Chance! You find things in 

the ether. 

GC: It was just a theory about chance. 

JD: Yeah, but they loved the theory. It was like a dogma. 

GC: I see a connection with the altar, the penis, and the 

notion of dress in Green Suit [1959, fig. 27}. 

JD: There was a toy when I was a kid called Bill Ding. It 

fascinated me. It was all the same guy, made out of wood, 

but he was in different colors, with a suit and a tie on. And 

you could put him on top of each other like an acrobat. It 

was endless fun to do for kids. And I thought about this toy 

while I was making Green Suit at the time of The House [i960, 

figs. 34, 35]. I just took that suit, I ripped it up, I shredded 

the legs, because the seat was all worn out and so were the 

knees. I shredded that to sort of make it hang in a certain 

way, and then it seemed to me the most natural thing to do 

was take some of these things and tie it into a penis. I don't 

know why, but that's what artists do. That's called inventing. 

GC: Yeah, but you transformed it in a certain way that 

imbues it with a female connotation. 

JD: I've always been comfortable with the woman in me. 

Always comfortable. As a child I often wondered what it 

meant to be both. I really always felt that. I've never in my

life, quite honestly, felt an attraction to men sexually. But 
that has nothing to do with feeling male and female. 
CB: Were you always interested in the idea of drag and 
masquerade? 

JD: I've always been fascinated with how one dresses. One 
puts on what one owns. The possibilities of a different variety 
of things, not unlike color charts. Back then when you went 
to Brooks Brothers, they never had men's suits on hangers. 
They had them lying on tables, all over the store, one on top 
of the other, and next to each other. The subtlety of the 
fabric was so fascinating. I would go on my lunch hour from 
teaching just to look at the fabric. I still go to fabric stores 
wherever I am to look at material. Because there is 
something about material — first, that somebody made it, 
and also that it has a different quality, like humans. 
GC: There are so many different definitions of dress now. 
Looking back, this element of your work has nothing to do 
with fashion; it has to do with identity. 

JD: Exactly. I used dress as a hedge against social fear. If one 
had a lot of clothes, one was more armored against the world. 
GC: Meaning you could change your identity. 
JD: \e-s, absolutely. And you didn't need to expose your nude self. 
GC: But Joseph Beuys said that if you stayed always the 
same, it was better, because your identity stays fixed and 
recognizable. He created the felt suit to keep fashion 
immobile; you saw dress as just the opposite. 
CB: And there is an ambivalence in your work between 
exposing yourself and using dress as a kind of armor. 
JD: \fes, but I am not walking around with my fly open. 
That's the luxury of being an artist. \bu don't have to. 
GC: Do you think that at the time your idea was to restrict 
the territory of your compositions in the way that clothing 
outlines the perimeters of the body? Certainly the previous 
generation, artists like Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, aimed 
at enlarging the scope of their actions as artists. They wanted 
to talk about the war, they wanted to break through to the 
outside. And your generation was trying to deal with the 
territories of dress, houses, shops, as icons of self. 
JD: Don't forget that the Abstract Expressionists were 
landscape painters, and we were not. We were internalized. 
And if there was a landscape, I carried it on my back. It's my 
landscape. It's the landscape inside me. That's what I am 
interested in. 

GC: In Green Suit the object becomes your body and it is a 
moment of leaving traces. Why such a fascination with 
making a stamp? 

JD: It's like a dog who pees on things. I am always moved by 
how a dog leaves traces. It claims it. "See, that's mine. I was 
here!" In the 1980s I went to see an unfinished Palladian 
villa called La Serasina outside of Venice, in a town called 
Noventa. It's now been bought, but it's never been finished. 
It's been lived in; it was never electrified, there was never 
water in it, but people had lived in it. They were peasants. 
It came with peasants, can you imagine! I went up into the 
attic, and on the eaves there was graffiti from that time 
until now. There was graffiti from builders, Palladio's 
builders. There was fascist graffiti from Nazi soldiers who 
stayed there on the way out, retreating. It was so moving to 
me that humans had touched something and wanted to 
leave their mark.

CB: You've told us about being frightened by many things 
when you were a child, but you seemed to have faced up to 
those childhood fears as an artist working .it this time. 
JD: Exactly. I had no fears as an artist. I had fears as a 
human. I was very aware ot how distant and unrelated 1 was 
to everyone else. That I was something else, something quite 
unto myself. I felt it was a tact of nature that 1 am different 
from everyone else. Not as an artist, but as a human. We 
probably all know that we aa- all different, but I am 
Speaking about it in an interpersonal way. I found it difficult 
to relate to anyone. 

CB: Your work constantly went back and forth between 
using the real and then the illusion. You have the real suit, 
and then in a number of your paintings later on, you actually 
have the illusion of the suit. Why the jump? Are they two 
very different things, the real and the illusion.'' 
JD: It's the question of what's real. For me, my sense of 
reality sometimes is one thing and sometimes it's the other. 
It's like an emotion. How in touch am I with how I really feel 
or how in touch am I with what reality is, what's going on 
with my sense of reality? That interests me always. Also, 
what looks best. Remember, I am a visual artist. 
GC: I low did you go from the idea of painting or objects to 
building The House [i960, figs. 34, 35}? Of course, the phallus 
and the Green S//it itself is a protrusion, but could you talk 
about the physical leap from painting to constructing an 
environment' 

JD: Well, the Judson had a lot of crap in storage from the 
theater, like stage flats. And Claes and I were going out all 
the time onto the street at night, and pulling in junk. Going 
out in the snow. And we were pulling in sttiff we found on 
the street, just to tise. I was teaching school, he was working 
in the library at Cooper, we didn't have any money. I was 
living uptown on first Avenue and was coming down at 
night, and he was meeting me, and we buy a little beer, and 
we get a little high, then we go out on the street and we pick 
Up all this stuff. We go back in, and we talk and we build. 
We drink, and that's what we did. That was the process. I 
built this like I built anything. I built The House like I built a 
painting. It just happened to have more things. 
CB: How did it evolve into the idea of a show? 
JD: We thought that slot at Judson was ours. It was probably 
Claes's idea, because that's the way he thinks. Theoretically. 
He probably said, "You do the house. I'll do the outside, you 
do the inside, because that's the way you are." 
GC: How did it come to life? 

JD: I was given an area. This was a great thing to have 
happened to an artist like me. An artist like me — I didn't 
have a studio. I was painting in my living room, which 
wasn't even a living room. I just turned it into my studio, 
and we lived in the kitchen, and in between was this railroad 
flat; we slept in one little cubicle and my kid slept in the 
other, which would've been where the living room was. It 
looked just like The House, and that's where I made Bedspring 
[i960, fig. 58] and all that stuff. 

GC: And did you know about Schwitters at the time? 
JD: Certainly, I knew about the Merzbau. And I loved 
Schwitters. But I didn't think of this as the Merzbau. When I 
think of Schwitters, I think of Cubism. Tht Houst was a 
depiction of my inner life of chaos 

CB: Is Tht Holts*, the first time you began to incorporate 
writing into your work' 

JD: I always had writing. I used it all the time in my 
painting then. 

CB: Do you remember when you first seized on the idea of 
merging the spaces of theater with the act of painting? 



JD: 1 was born thai way. I luul already spent my late teenage 

years and my earl\ twenties in Ohio in school a&lt; ting the 
same way. Going to a building as the year ended and spring 
1 ame to ( )hio, going to an abandoned house in the country, 

and jusi drawing on the walls, and jumping off the root, and 
getting drunk and making something pan ol the whole 

thing. Making it all part ot life. 

GC: Did you have spec ifk influences from TV or the mo\ ies? 
JD: In my family, TV didn't come until I was about fifteen, 
about [950—51. But I hate TV. Movies lor me are tin- thing. 
And I always preferred black-and-white movies. Because ot 
my generation, ami also because- ot who I am. I never took a 
movie any other way but like- that it was real — that I had a 
real experience. But during the early '60s, when I was having 
a breakdown and unable to leave the house-. I didn't go to 
movies. I elieln't do anything. I couldn't sit in a movie without 
going nuts. So, I was watching tele\ isioii all the tune. I 
lookeel at everything. Through the day. I watched everything. 
Actually, Bob Whitman and 1 useel to speak about it, too. 
Because we had little children, we watched children's TV in 
the late '50s, early '60s, and that said something about the 
kinel ot performances we made, 'flu-re was a kind of 
repetition to little children that both ot us used, an 
obsessiveness that both of us used. 

CB: Would you model your performances on spec ifi( ideas 
you got from these programs? 

JD: We woulel refer to Captain Kangaroo. Whitman and 1 
reterreel to him a lot. We listened to his waj ol Speaking and 
the way the characters spoke. It put the performances out ot 
the realm of literal theater by these characters for children 
speaking to them in this odd way, which wasn't naturalistic . 
We were able to look at that as a kind of performance, too. 
Plus also, I don't think I've ever saiel this before, and it would 
be hard to write about, but George Segal's son Geoffrey is 
autistic, and I knew him as a young boy, when he was maybe 
ten or eleven. And he would watch those programs. I was 
always drawn to kids who did not fit in. Even when I was a 
kid, I was fascinated by children who had deformities that 
were not fixed, like they are today. There was a kid I went to 
school with who had two thumbs. Today, you wouldn't allow 
two thumbs. They would take one off at birth and that 
woulel be that. This kiel had two thumbs, and he kept his 
bus money between the two thumbs. And I thought this was 
like art — it was another kind of sculpture. And the same- 
with Geoffrey Segal. He and 1 had conversations .it picnics I 
went to at Kaprow's with Segal and Whitman and (lacs and 
everybody. Geoffrey Segal and 1 would stand there laughing 
about these children's programs, because we were- both 
involved in watching them on TV. Because he couldn't stop 
repeating himself in his autism, he kept calling out. "Mr. 
Green Jeans." Aiul he would say, "Hello, Mr. Green Jeans! 
Hello, Mr. Green Jeans! Hello, Mr. Green jeans'" and 1 took 
it totally seriously, as though it was a form ot narrative and a 
form of conversation. So that's what I was looking at. 
GC: So you think that this kind ot c oming together of 
Kaprow, Oldenburg, Dick Higgins, Richard Tyler, etc. was 
strategic in a certain way because- it reinforced what vou were 
already thinking. You know, we arc- totalh different, but in 
the end, you need the impact of not only yourself, because at 
the end you believe in yourself, but you neeel energy around 
you. 

JD: And you need validation. Friends u 1 \ e ■ it to you. Red 
Grooms couldn't be more- ot a different artist, but when I saw 
him perform The Burning Building it confirmed my idea of 
Tht Smiling Workman {tie.s. j6 wl. and ( laes was interested 
in doing similar kinds ot work. And even Kaprow, who was

an artist of no interest to me whatsoever except that I liked 

his paintings. I liked his paintings in the mid-^os, which I 

saw in reproduction in Ohio. Kaprow had something, 

because he wasn't really a painter. He was more of a 

theoretician. The art he made was kind of primitive in a way, 

untutored. But I had no interest in 18 Happenings in 6 Parts. 

But to meet somebody like Bob Whitman was a trip! Every 

year Whitman made one painting. He just made it. It was 

his thing to do once a year, to make a painting. He had 

Rauschenbergs on the wall. He bought Rauschenbergs, and 

he was making this mad stuff. I thought, What's going on 

here? 

GC: What strikes me about this period in your work is the 

very short time that you were doing the performances. 

JD: You mean the duration of each performance? Or the 

short period of time over which I did them? 

GC: Both. But, as distinct works they feel more like a 

gesture. Not as a gesture as a poly-gesture, but it's more as in 

life. You say a phrase and you leave. It's again very personal. 

It's not a long story, it is something happening in real time. 

How do you see this idea of time now, today? 

JD: You mean, why did I do that then? 

GC: Yeah. 

JD: Because I couldn't sustain the passion any longer. It was 

like the male orgasm versus foreplay. 

GC: So, no plateau. Just ups and downs. 

JD: Right. It was the power of an object, of a single, central 

image. It was one thing. I made an object. In this case it was 

a play, whatever it was. This performance. But it was within 

a certain time, and it kept the power. Otherwise, like you say, 

you have ups and downs. Now you have to remember that 

Bob Whitman and me, Lucas Samaras, Marcus Ratliff, 

almost everybody around us were of the same age, except for 

Claes, who was older. He was a formed, sophisticated, 

European man with all sorts of irony and all sorts of 

references. References and fine schooling. He'd gone to Yale. 

Everything Claes took in about America, he took it in as an 

outsider. He's not an American. Now as Americans, we're all 

from somewhere else, but in his case, he matured with these 

parents who were diplomats, and he was a gentleman. 

Whereas I came from Europeans, but we lived an American 

experience in the Midwest and aspired to that, and then of 

course, I always aspired to Europe in another way. So, 

Whitman and all of us, we did something that was like 

television, like early television, or like the movies. We were 

not doing Moliere. 

GC: The kinds of performances you were engaged in were 

more akin to advertising — a thirty-second sales pitch. 

JD: It was like driving on a highway, and you saw a billboard 

and you went by it. Or like the Burma Shave signs. 

CB: Did you rehearse any of the performances? 

JD: I rehearsed mainly with myself, because I was mainly in 

them alone. I rehearsed the technical parts with somebody 

else to put the tape-recorder on, and those sort of things. In 

Car Crash [figs, iz, 13, 44-46], I rehearsed, but I already had 

it in my mind what was going to happen, and I told people 

what to do, and they did it. It was not hard. It was not 

complicated. 

CB: Was it scripted? 

JD: It was scripted in terms for myself. I was the one who 

carried the power of it anyway. It was my acting, even in Car 

Crash. The others were neutral figures that were like objects 

in a landscape, Patty Oldenburg, and Mark, and Judy Tersch. 

They were objects for me, but I was the living force. It was 

like making a drawing. 

CB: Were you conscious of the audience when you 



64 



performed!'' Did you play to their emotions.'' 

JD: Well, they weren't improvisation. I responded to the 

audience's response, and the audience always responded. 

The audience was there looking for a thrill. As people go to 

the theater. You want to he entertained. And this particular 

audience, which was mainly a crowd of our peers, even though 

they were sometimes much, much older, were ripe to be 

amused and to he titillated, and to he informed in some way. 

CB: Would you interject humor where you may not have 

thought about having it before.'' 

JD: No. I never even thought they were funny, but everybody 

laughed all the time. 

GC: From nervousness? 

JD: From being embarrassed. They laughed like crazy. 

Personal things make humans nervous. 

GC: Were you interested in the idea of shamanist? The silver 

paint on your head in the performance of Car Crash evokes 

the idea. Of course in Europe, Beuys was combining tat, felt, 

and copper in his works. Did you know about Zen theory.-' 

JD: We knew about it. 

GC: Ik-cause of Cage? And not only Cage . . . 

JD: Not just Cage, but there was "Zen in the Art of 

Archer\." I knew about that in the 'sos. 

CB: Did you know much about existentialism? 

JD: 1 never quite understood it. As a student I read Camus, 

but 1 read it as a story, not as a manifesto. 

GC: Did you have any knowledge about Fontana and the 

Gutai Group? 

JD: The only knowledge I had of the Gutai group was when 

we first came to New York, there was talk of them among 

the Abstract Expressionists, and Martha Jackson might have 

shown them or maybe they had a festival of kites or 

something like that. Fontana 1 saw because Martha Jackson 

showed Fontana, but I never really responded to it. I thought 

it was mannered, very handsome, and chic. 

GC: Very formalistic. 

JD: It was so elegant, and it was my idea of what Italy was 

like. I didn't know. I'd never been to Italy. 

CB: Did you feel that in order for your audience to really 

understand your work they really had to understand you as 

the author.'' 

JD: No, it they get the work, they understand me better, but 

they don't have to get me. You don't have to know me to get 

the work. There is a universal quality to it. I know this, 

because I know how people respond to the work, both bad 

and good. I never get a neutral response. It's always a 

response. 1 always get kissed or fucked, or 1 get stabbed in 

the back. 

GC: The difference with the other so-called Pop artists such 

as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol was that their works 

were so detached. They didn't talk about themselves. And\ 

was the extreme of unexpressiveness, &lt;&gt;t what is supposedly 

"objective." 

JD: I am everybody's nightmare. A provocateur.

1: Why did you dress up for the opening night of your 
jv at the Reuben. Gallery in the spring of i960 {fig. 55]? 
as a one-man-show, and I remember Irving Sandler 
had reviewed the show by looking at the work two months 
•arlier, and then I made all new work. I just made all new 

rk, and I dressed up in my khaki suit that I had dyed red. 
I wanted to be in the work. I wanted to be part of the work. 
It was part of the time; you felt like you could do that. Take 

iu like, but it's me. 
GC It was a gesture that the previous generation would 
never have attempted. 

JD: They would have been embarrassed by it. They would've 
saal, "This isn't serious. We are not actors. We are serious 
intellectuals. We are not circus performers, we are serious 
people. We are intellectuals." Whereas I said, "I am what I 
am." You know, I am what I am — I am the art, and I am 
also the man who makes the art, and I look at the art, and 
char's it. I am in it! That's me! 

CB: Some of your earliest paintings made during the time of 
the performances, such as Two Nests [November i960, fig. 56] 
and Green Lips [1961, fig. 61}, treat the central image as a 
reduction of form. The images operate as holes that allow for 
closer introspection to the canvas itself. In Two Nests, it is 
possible to read: "This is a Portrait of 2 Persons by Jim Dine 
November i960." Were these, in fact, portraits? 
JD: Two Nests is on Masonite, and I remember making it, 
and painting it, and trying to make a painting. Then I took a 
drill, and I started to drill these little holes and I made it 
look like bees' or wasps' nests. And so, then this whole thing 
became this object. 

CB: Were you at all conscious of trying to undermine the 
idea of the masterpiece by literally drilling right in the 
middle of the painting? 

JD: I don't have any of those kind of what I would call 
destructive aspects of undermining the masterpiece. That's a 
little too political for me. One of the things that I use as a 
medium in my work and have always used is anger. I get 
pissed off. All my life I've had anger, and when I get pissed 
off and I'd see a thing doesn't work, or say I'm pissed off 
about something else, I have put axes through canvases, I've 
kicked them in half, I've balled them up, I've taken drawings 
and soaked them in water, made them into a ball and threw 
them against the wall, and that's all I need to do, and then 
it's over, and I peel the drawing open, put it up and I start 
again. And I never ever think of that as a method; but 
thinking about it now, it was a method. 
GC: So the object is morbid in a certain way? 
JD: It's an old alchemical idea from the Middle Ages. You 
make gold from shit. You turn sand into gold. Green Lips and 
the others are what I would call "interior paintings." They 
were much more focused on this primary small central 
object. I was trying to harness my craziness, and I was trying 
to be cool. And you know, you can't make somebody "be 
cool," but for a few months I was. I did them before I was 
able 10 burst out with Hair {1961, fig. 66] and make 
something that was more strong. 
( .( So they were a kind of training? 
JD: Yeah, but also I was not pleased with being this 
Expressionist boy. I mean, I've come to accept that about 

«lt, that's what I am, a Romantic Expressionist artist, but 
in thos&lt; .lays, I wouldn't want to have had that title. I 
wanted 10 be cool! 

GC: Let's talk about the language of painting that you 
developed ov&lt; r those- chr&lt; • 11 : following the waning of 
Abstra&lt; i I • j . m. 

JD: In 1 Ik first place, I am a student and a child of Abstract 



Expressionism. I simply learned to paint by looking at those 
paintings. I would come to New York City from Ohio 
University in Athens at least once a month. Drive all night, 
go to about a hundred shows, see de Kooning dead drunk on 
the stteet, on Tenth Street, go home, try to do it again. Try to 
do it! Try to get that freedom, try to get rid of those regional 
brushstrokes I had. Purposely! Because I thought it was 
beautiful painting. Already I knew how Picasso put the paint 
on. It's like I was born with certain facilities, and one of them 
is I can paint. I don't have an awkward hand, particularly. 
Sometimes. In fact, I had to make it awkward at times, so 
that I could live with it. It becomes too glib. So, I tried that. 
Then I saw — whenever that show was, but I think it was '57, 
maybe it was '56 — Jasper's show with the Target with the 
penis and all this stuff, and the Flag. The Flag meant 
nothing to me. I still don't think it's such a brilliant thing. I 
thought the Targets were something amazing, with the 
objects above them, the way he did that, and the way I saw 
it, and the use of this encaustic, which was so much his. 
That's why I consider someone like Serra a beautician. He 
looked at Johns and threw some lead, because that was Johns' 
aesthetic, you know. Johns had a kind of cuisine that he 
developed in paint. I am not speaking content; I am 
speaking purely painting. That for me is some of the most 
beautiful painting probably since Titian. Some people may 
be offended by it. I don't think I even like the way he paints 
particularly now, but it's the relationship his hand and eye 
have to paint. And encaustic worked well for him, lead 
worked well for him. So, I saw all that work, and in my 
youthful, childish ambition, I wanted to do something like 
that. But I knew I didn't want to use encaustic, because that 
was already Johns's. And I had used it, funny enough, I did 
use it once, but those things don't exist anymore. I stole 
crayons, wax crayons, when I was teaching little kids, and I 
used to steal them by the carton. And I'd boil them on the 
stove and I'd paint with them. Because I didn't have any 
money anyway, but I hated it. I wasn't getting what he was 
getting. He was a master of this. So I started to use paint in a 
way as though paint was an object itself.

EXPRESS 



For years i plan what ill wear for overnite As the 
time to leave gets closer i panic and change it all 
Some of my advisers think im hysterical My voice 
gets louder and sharper like a rat I leave and go 
thru the wet ice passage to board the train that will 
go on land and water to put me in the city My 
companion in my compartment is a large southern man 
with a gruff cough Before we get into our beds the 
train pulls out and a woman walks down the hall and 
we both eye her so that the other one will see This 
reassures both of us that neither one is queer We 
now can sleep At a certain point i am woken by the 
rolling and pitching of sea Next door there is the 
sound of stainless steel vomiting I eat a pear I 
wake up on an icedover window speeding forward route 

Two hours later the train gets us to the city Oh yes 
once during the night i forgot to say that the man 
sharing my compartment breathed heavily and i thought 
for a second since it was dark and all i could see 
was my green glowing watchface that he was my wife 
and i was at home in my own bed and i wasn't moving 
and i was afraid

You sometimes have a calligraphic way of handling 
Where does this come from? 

: In Hair [fig. 66), the ribbons of paint do not come from 
•on Pollock at all. If it comes from anything, it comes 
from Dick Tracy, the American comic book. The cartoonlike 
depiction of hair. That's what I was trying to do — to find a 
to depict hair in paint rather than in wood or steel or 

itever. 1 thought that by squeezing it out of the tube, I 
would get this feeling. 
CB: Was it the graphic quality of the comic strip that you 

trying to achieve? 
JD: I was going tor a quality of the relationship of paint as a 
physical object. 

GC: So you were specifically looking for three- 
dimensionality. 

JD: Yes. A piece of red paint is no different than a pencil if 
I use it, or vice versa. If I use a yellow pencil, I use a yellow 
pencil. If I use a piece of yellow paint, that's another kind 
of object. They all have history. I know that. I know that 
when I put a hammer down, a hammer has an association 
for people, and if you have a new hammer, it's a different 
association than if you have an old hammer. 
CB: So, it's about the object and not the gesture. 
JD: It's not gesture. Exactly. It is memory, it's a collective 
memory. I was confident, always confident, that somewhere 
one person would understand it, because it was in the human 
consciousness. A hammer, it's a primary object. 
GC: And why the addition of the name? 
JD: I think it was sometimes a lack of confidence I had that 
people would understand what it was. Because if I didn't say 
"hair" on there, what would you think it would be? You 
could say it's a flesh-colored landscape. I mean, it was like 
saying, "This is what it is." It was purposely dumb in a way. 
GC: Is it tautological? 

JD: It is tautological. I was going to use that word, but I 
didn't know if I should. Oyvind Falstrom used that word to 
describe my work when he wrote about me in '62. He talked 
about tautology. 

CB: Were the works you made in 1961 conceived in series? 
JD: I remember making a group of paintings at one point 
that year — Tie Tie, Green Ties in a Landscape {fig. 73}, and 
Hair. Now, I made those in the course of maybe two weeks 
altogether. All in one time. Each one is painted differently. 
The idea that those paintings painted so differently are 
painted at the same time doesn't mean that I was 
schizophrenic, it means that I had one intention and a lot of 
ideas around the intention. And that there were some ways 
to make certain things one way, and in another idea you do 
another way. There is a way to make a poem, there is a way to 
sing a song, there is a way to write a novel. It can come from 
the same person. 

CB: What does the tie represent? 

JD: What did occur to me was that the tie was a vaginal 
form. 

CB: Not a phallus? 

JD: No, the tie was a vaginal form. The tie was also a 
beautiful object in itself, because of the patterns that could 

'lone. 
CB: Many of the works feel as if you are looking at the object 
under a mil roscope. The idea of territories or parameters 

.ork. Why the idea of the close-up? 
JD: Blonde Wan I [961, fig. 67] is made this way. I wanted to 
make ;om&lt; thing more formal than Hair. Literally more 
formal, \\ isi I my hands to paint with. But not in a 

in (1 way, It 1 my hands as though they were a tool for 
making vertical I 1 the paint. A tool like a comb. And 



in Red Knife [1962, fig. 82}, I thought I was doing something 

like Johns with the red background, but in fact it was nasty 

and ugly, because I painted it in a way, not like Johns with 

love, but with anger. And it came up looking different, really 

different. 

GC: The idea of hanging that pervades these works is really 

powerful because there are so many connotations. 

JD: Castration. Or the hanging of limbs? 

GC: They are also an offering, or a sacrifice. 

JD: I always was interested about the relics of the saints too. 

Fingers of the saints. You know, this is so-and-so's finger. I 

thought that was amazing. To worship, to get a frisson from 

an object was fantastic to me. 

GC: It is like trying to reconstruct the history of the detail. 

By zooming in you start to look at details, and from details 

you recognize perhaps a person, perhaps the human being. 

Zooming from the outside to uncover the inside. 

CB: Can we talk more about your choice of materials in your 

work? 

JD: I had a long romance, and still do, with house paint. 

Long before I even heard of Jackson Pollock, in the late '30s 

when I was three and four years old, I was using house paint. 

And that's the first paint I ever saw. I didn't see oil paint for 

many, many years. Actually, I once found in my grandpa's 

attic a set of oil paints from the '20s that somebody had had, 

and I squeezed them out like toothpaste. This had power for 

me. The house paint had power for me, and the color charts 

of house paints had power for me. Because the colors were 

without compromise and without subtlety. American colors 

were not so much about decoration. 

CB: Did you often use house painter's brushes to apply the 

paint? 

JB: Oh, I still do. I always use house painter's brushes. 

Always. 

GC: And by using house paint, did it mean that you didn't 

have to compose a color, that it was already found? 

JD: It is a found object. Each color is an object for me. But I 

mix. It's also because of my hyperactivity and my speed, and 

speed is very much a metaphor for me, for myself, I feel. 

Because that's how I compose, through speed. And I am 

confident about that. House paint, you open it up, and you 

got light green, it's already there, so I don't have to fuck 

around with making it. I am confident it will work somehow. 

You open it, it's there. It's like walking down the street. 

Everybody is there. 

GC: So, you trust color immediately? 

JD: I trust anything walking down the street. I trust what is 

out there. I never in my life consciously thought about color. 

I pick up a tube; if it doesn't work, I'll take it off then. 

Sometimes if it works, I take it off and do it again with 

another one, because I figure, if I could do it the first time, 

I'll do it the second time. 

CB: Did you know what your paintings were going to look 

like before you painted them, or did they change during the 

process of creating them? 

JD: It's always in the process of making them that I know 

what they are going to look like. I never know what they are 

going to look like before. It's always in the process. I never 

made a sketch for anything. I never planned anything out 

that ever turned out the way it was intended. It's always in 

the activity of working. I thought Teeth [1960-61, fig. 76] was 

an abstract painting that said "teeth" on it. There was so 

much painted underneath it of what it was going to be. I 

didn't know it was going to be teeth until the end. 

GC: So, when you paint, you reveal to yourself? 

JD: To myself. Yes, that's how I think.

ike it off, instead of building. 
r.ise. 

.vays erase. I believe in erasing. Erasing for me is 
ing the sacrament. 
:B: . there traces underneath the paintings that you 

iple to understand? Do they carry the history of the 

JD: No, the history is going to be there anyway. It's 
absolutely going to be there. I mean, pentimento for me is 
ir is the memory of the work — what happened 
before. 

GC: It is a classical tradition that you paint over and over 
until you get it. 

JD: Until you get what you want. Yes. It's an old way of 
thinking. It is what makes me, without breaking it, part of a 
Western tradition. And that is important to me. 
GC: And when do the objects start to come in as icons or 
images? I see bodies and a sequence that you have slowly 
built — shoes, the hat, and all this. How did you get to these 
images? After you build up, then what is left is a detail, is a 
trace, is a memory of human being passing there in essence? 
What is the object now? Because it's not anymore a product 
for me. 

JD: It's not a product at all. It's my mark. I am leaving my 
mark to say I was here. 

GC: That's why the Pop definition doesn't fit. 
JD: Exactly. And it's so obvious to look at the hat in my 
painting Hat [1961] and say, "Yes, he got it from Magritte." 
And I honestly didn't. I really didn't think about that. I 
thought about tautology. Instead of writing hat under that 
one, I put a hat. And the derby was all involved with 
vaudeville. It was something we talked about, Claes, and me, 
and Ratliff, and all these people. The derby came from our 
little period of show business. 

CB: I'm struck by how there is so much concentration on the 
background or field of the canvas. For instance in Pearls 
[1961, fig. 72] the necklace is the smallest element of the 
canvas, the main focus is not on the object per se, but on the 
ground of representation itself. 

JD: It was a way to paint without exposing too much of 
myself, and yet, it was a way to be au courant. It was a way to 
be part of a group, such as it was, and it was a way to belong 
as a young man; it was a way to possibly get famous. I found 
this very personal work. In fact, whenever I looked at the 
words on the bottom, I thought it said "penis." And then 
other people said it to me too, without me ever saying it. 
And I didn't make that. I said "pearls." This was like the 
beginnings of my exploration of my unconsciousness. 
GC: Your subject matter often refers to extremes of the body, 
things thai stop at the body's perimeter, such as shoes or a 
hat. Red Suspenders [1961, fig. 70] is almost a definition of a 
soul or limitation or constriction, if I look at the way the 
straps cross the canvas symbolically. The works speak to 
defining the territory 0! the inside. 

|1 ) When I got to that point, past the tie, and I got to the 
suspenders or the shoe, 1 think I was like on a roll of 
asso&lt; 1. it ion. I would just say "shoe," and I made Shoe [1961, 

7]. Now, the reason I made that kind of shoe, that 
brown-and-white shoe, was because in those years, a lot of us 
were talking about Art Deco in the '30s and talking about 
I red Astairc, and talking about haberdashery. I was trying to 
re&lt; onstru 1 a historj for myself of where I came from. At 
thin figu re out where I came from , 

I mean, thi pear, be&lt; ause of the union of 

two 1 ' • 
( ,( Becau iu wei what connects you as 



an adult to the limbo of your tough childhood, and so you 

were trying to do that in your painting by appropriating a 

cultural reference. Did you look at Fred Astaire as a symbol 

in trying to create a patchwork of your own history? 

JD: Of my own mythology. A personal mythology that I 

tried to make for myself, so that I am in this world. So I am 

not of ether, I am not of vapor. I have two feet on the ground, 

I am trying to say, "It's me." Friends could not help me, my 

wife could not help me, having children could not help me. I 

had to finally come to myself, and always find ways to hold 

on; otherwise, I float out into the atmosphere. Art saved me. 

Art grabbed me and held me. 

CB: Your objects often function like holders? 

JD: They held me in place. 

GC: So you were trying to say, "This is my memory," or 

"This I would like to have as a memory, because of my 

drama," whatever it was. 

JD: This personal drama that maybe nobody else would have 

found dramatic, but I found it dramatic. 

GC: And what about the small kind of shelf? 

JD: I don't know. I was getting ready to put objects on it, 

but didn't. I still think it's such a convenient thing, and a 

way to make something very pleasant-looking. Furniture for 

your self. 

CB: Up to this point, a lot of the works are about the flesh, 

the idea of the tattoo, hair, the skin as covering. Is the 

background in these works flesh? Is it skin? 

JD: Well, probably it was thought to be flesh, as though it 

was a close-up, but it's not like that. I only used the color of 

flesh, maybe for that reason, but it also gave me a way to 

paint. Just paint, work it out with paint somehow. 

CB: So it's about surface. 

JD: Yes, it can be about surface. 

CB: The surface seems to take you from a very classical 

painterly formal idea in your work to a more theoretical idea 

involving the body and memory. 

GC: It's about the object coming in. And some of the objects 

you painted over, yes? 

JD: Yes. 

CB: Did you feel that painting over the objects was a way of 

changing those objects into a painted illusion? 

JD: No, it made them mine. And sometimes I didn't paint 

over the objects, because I liked the way they looked without 

painting on them. In the end, my final reasons for doing 

things a certain way are what I see. 

GC: And there is — to use a word I don't like — a realistic 

aspect to this. 

JD: It was a certain kind of realism, though. I was very much 

a fan of certain nineteenth-century American realists like 

James Peto or William Harnett. Because I was amazed by 

them. Because I felt they were collagists. They were, in their 

way. They just happened to be painting objects. Putting it 

together, making arrangements. They were sometimes like 

Schwitters. I was thrilled by that. They inspired me. The 

combination, the mood, the little scene that they built 

within a certain stage. It was a staged thing. They weren't 

looking out the window. I figure anybody could do that. 

That's the way I was born. You know, if I looked out the 

window today, and I took a canvas upstairs, I'd make a 

beautiful painting for you, but it doesn't interest me. Peto 

and Harnett made a setting for something, and it was 

enclosed in this very tense space. 

GC: But your arena of expression in each work is a single 

object, which is a relic of your own traces? 

JD: Yes, my own traces. 

GC: So, you construct your universe through detail.

"There's a kind of state of dumbness 
that I like, too, which is not 
unrelated to children, child art, or 
mad art. Maybe putting yourself into 
a naive state, which — and Ym not 




done purely, but I like to use it like 
one would use paint. If s another 
way, another medium. " 
(Jim Dine, 1966) 






. 



"In about three months, I made about thirty painth 



130 



r s of tools. It was a great burst. "(Jim Dine, 1966) 



131 



: Was Big Black Work Wall [1961, fig. 80] the first piece 
you did with tools? 

JD: I don't know if it's the first one, but I made that first 
group of Tool paintings in about a month. And I must have 
made thirty paintings, which Ileana showed the first time in 
Europe in '63. 

CB: Was going to a hardware store and buying all of this 
stuff part of a process, that when you were in the store you 
had in your mind what kind of paintings you wanted to do 
with the objects? 

JD: For years I would go to the hardware store and I would 
steal some things; I'd look for the cheap things. By 1962, 
when I began the Bathroom paintings [figs. 96, 98, 99, 
101—06], we went to East Hampton for the summer and 
rented a house, when East Hampton wasn't very fancy. I went 
to the hardware store out there and it became a sensuous 
experience, like a child being let loose in a candy store, 
except it was a hardware store. I couldn't believe what the 
possibilities were. And I got the ideas in the hardware store, 
rather than coming to the hardware store and needing 
something to put onto a painting. I had to be in a hardware 
store to get the charge. You can never get that same charge 
again. It's like virginity, you know. And actually, the first 
time I could buy something there was when they let me 
open a charge account. 

CB: Did you buy the same thing over and over? 
JD: Sometimes I'd buy dozens of hammers. But also, I got so 
excited to find something that was inspiring. A tool can be 
inspiring. Not just because it's some sort of phallic symbol, 
but because this tool is a beautiful object in itself. It has 
been refined to be an extension of one's hand, over the 
centuries, in a process of evolution. And it can inspire you 
that way. It has all this history. 

CB: Did you recognize the authorship that went into the 
making of each tool itself? That there was an artist behind 
those objects? 

JD: No. I recognized the human hand. The need in the 
human hand that created those objects. There was no author. 
There were authors. It was every time anybody used one, 
they found a better way to make it. 
GC: So, is the tool an extension? Does it represent the 
extension of your arm? And in a certain way it's the same as 
dress? 

JD: Exactly. 

GC: Like the hat or a shoe is an extension, it's the aura of 
your body extending out? 
JD: A tool is like a bone. 

GC: Joseph Beuys was using a stick as an extension of a 
finger, but that was a totally different connotation, because it 
was about the notion of holding. For you, is the tool the 
design of the body? Were you also interested in the beauty of 
the object on the plastic level? 

JD: Yeah. For me, the beauty of it is first on the plastic level. 
Sometimes I can almost go to my knees, it's so beautiful! 
GC: So you're really strongly involved in the design of it? 
JD Yes 

CB: What was your relationship to technology at the time? 
J I): It was and is a non-relationship. I don't have a computer. 
I don't know how to work a VCR properly. I am unable to 
put things together except by my way. It's all about dyslexia. 
It's about not being able to perceive instructions, lest I create 
tin- instruction myself, That is why I read backwards. That's 
how I can drive a car. I am quite handy, actually, but I have 
to be- able to do it with my hands. 

( .( So. tools lor you were not a conceptual clement. They 
were about labor. 



JD: They were an extension of my feelings. They had 

nothing to do with the conceptual. That is why I always felt 

like such an outsider in a conceptual age. 

GC: In 1965 Joseph Kosuth showed the tools along with their 

definition, which avoided the physical in favor of the idea of 

the tools in a human relationship. The importance of 

isolating an object in a background and making it into a 

relation between the word and the name comes out of your 

works. 

JD: It seemed so natural for me. As I said, I never 

questioned why I did this, could I do that. Should things be 

like this? Should they be formal? Are there formal rules? It 

just was a natural extension of my feelings. A tool was the 

memory of this working person who worked it out. That's 

how it evolved. 

GC: Many of the objects emit brushstrokes as if they are 

radiation. Does it come from your looking at Futurist 

painting, this idea of energy passing through form, or from 

your use of lamps and light in the works? 

JD: I never thought of that. I always thought it was texture. 

GC: In a work like Window with an Axe [1961 — 62, fig. 93} you 

again play with the idea of the double. Why do you always 

select a double kind of mirroring? And in this period, there 

is a lot of black. Black window, black door, black painting. 

Does black evoke for you, consciously or not, the idea of 

dying in order to be reborn? 

JD: I don't know. The art store around the corner was selling 

some strange black oil paint that came in cans, which I never 

saw before, and I used to buy a lot of it. And I used a lot of 

dark gray, which refers to lead, and to gray putty, and gray 

paint or gray linoleum for the floor. The linoleum was always 

gray. When I was growing up, it was a time of black and 

white. I was not living in Mexico, you know. This was 

Cincinnati, Ohio. The color was black and white. What I 

mean by that is the color of working is black and white. 

Nothing was painted bright colors to make it attractive to 

sell. 

CB: How did the notion of working enter your paintings as 

an idea at that time? Were you thinking along the line of 

building? 

JD: No. I was thinking of depicting work, the act of 

working. It was the idea of rather than painting someone 

working, how about painting the job itself. Making a 

painting of a job itself. In Big Black Work Wall, I was trying 

to make a painting, flatten it out, but to speak about the act 

of working, and to see how I could make art of it. To 

compose. Proposed Still Life [1962, fig. 94] was in the same 

vein. Instead of making a painting of tools arranged in a 

certain way, I thought, Why not make a painting of the act 

of making a still life? So I attached a bunch of tools at the 

top and wrote instructions at the bottom. 

GC: From a European point of view, your position to qualify 

the workman was ideologically very strong at the time. It's 

an interesting shift from the previous generation. 

JD: I didn't think of working class, I thought of workmen. 

The dignity of it. There is no greater thing you can do than 

to work with your hands. That is what I do. 

GC: Pop art could be interpreted as expressing a more 

democratic attitude, whereas Abstract Expressionism was 

aristocratic. 

JD: I am very aristocratic. I am not asking for an art of the 

people. 

GC: So, in a certain way, Pop art can be interpreted in this 

way — as popular image, but dealing with a low level of 

democratic elements, something that everybody can 

understand. 



132 



JD: But de Kooning, who was a house painter, who was 

trained as a decorative house painter, I think he must have 

felt that a bit too about his painting — the way he painted, 

the kind of material he used, etc. 

CB: So, part of it was about getting away from the cult of 

the artist-genius. 

JD: It's what the New York School artists did, too. 

GC: It is the same as Leonardo da Vinci dealing with 

technical drawings. Leonardo had the same attitude toward 

drawing machinery, and applying the knowledge ot 

practicality to anatomy. Do you think that being democratic 

comes from being an American also? 

JD: It's totally American. 

GC: As an American, you create your own territory, while 

the structure in Europe is still totally aristocratic. 

CB: You once said that when you were working on the Tool 

paintings, you did them all in a tremendous burst of creative 

activity. Was that all you did then, Tool paintings!-' 

JD: Yeah. And I ended up feeling that together they all 

could have been considered one work, particularly the 

monochromatic ones. 

CB: Did you think of them as being in dialogue with one 

another? 

JD: Yes. 

GC: And in each of them, you created a dialogue between 

the tools and the canvas. 

JD: Right. The canvas was a stage for it. 

CB: Did you think of theater design when creating the Tool 

paintings? 

JD: No, I thought of making a theater for myself. 

GC: And you thought of the tools as actors? 

JD: Yeah, just like the vegetables were in Vaudeville Show 

[i960, figs. 40-42}. 

CB: In the paintings, the tools maintain on some level their 

usual role in the world. You don't put them in a context in 

which they are doing something they don't normally do. 

JD: That's right, they are not doing something in a Surrealist 

way. It's not the "Dance of the Brooms." Like everything else 

I do, the Tool paintings are self-portraits. 

GC: In Colorful Hammering [1962, fig. 91], the energy is very 

futuristic. It's really the energy of the tool, not in the 

futuristic sense of technology, but the idea that the object 

has an energy of diffusion, which is like the theories of 

Rudolf Steiner. 

CB: It's translucent, like a film negative. 

JD: It is a dream. 

GC: It's kind of an army. It's also a cartoon. You extend the 

idea of being a child and playing, and having these actors on 

your stage and being funny and real and not real, and a 

phantom. In this case, you are tracing the gesture as an 

object? 

JD: Yes, as an object. 

CB: There is something apocalyptic about the way the 

hammer hangs downward and the fires consume it. The 

hammer reminds me of Peter's cruxifixion, of Peter hanging 

upside down on the cross. 

JD: No, all that is is the hammer itself. It's hung up like a 

hunting trophy. It's a still life. 

CB: And there is the reference to Johns. 

JD: Well, he was looking at my work at the time, and I was 

looking at his. 

GC: In Hammer Study [1962, fig. 90}, the object exists as a 

drawing, a shadow, and an object, as if you were breaking the 

object into different fragments. 

JD: It's a study of a hammer, a dissection of a hammer. The 

handle, the head, the drawing, shades of being. It's my 



primitive- attempt at some sort ot analysis ot an object. 
CB: Your drawing as opposed to your painting stems to be- 
about the way light hits an obje( t, sin&lt; e your drawings are 
never flai , but modeled. 

JD: That's because I hold on to classical drawing. 
GC: Were you going to museums to hone your tec hnique? 
JD: Not specifically tor that Hut I always went to museums, 
and 1 love drawing ami 1 love painting. When 1 went to 
museums, I was trying to reaffirm that 1 came from 
something and was moved by the genius ot the past, so I 
have two things going. I want to be a modern man. I want to 
be a modern artist, and I couldn't care less. I would rather be, 
you know, Tiepolo. 

CB: You've said that you were more influenced at th.it time 
by the Flemish masters than by the Italian masters. What 
was it about the work ot the Flemish painters that was so 
significant tor you.-' 

JD: The isolation of each person as an object. Everything was 
treated as an object. They painted as though it was a 
melange of hammers and saws, except it's people. It's Christ 
and it's Mary and it's all this. But they are painted in a space 
that is isolated, floating in the space. What they did 
formally with people, I thought I was doing with tools.

CB: When I see the objects that you use in a lot of your 

ks, I can't help thinking of the gender differences 
between workshop tools — objects from the man's 

■ground, so to speak — and kitchen utensils, which are 
radinonally the woman's arena, which don't appear much in 
our work. Did you think of combining these tools and all 
these related objects as making inventions? 
JD: Yeah. That's a good point. Finding all those things and 
inventing. I was like the mad scientist. It was like the wizard 
was down in the basement. Remember in "The Sorcerer's 
Apprentice" with Mickey Mouse? But I also felt that 
whatever I found down there would be useful. I knew I could 
make something great, and of course I never did, but the 
mystery of it, the mystery of finding objects and working 
with them, and the idea of accumulating things, a lot of 
things together. During the war, everybody I knew hoarded 
canned goods in the basements because we thought there 
would be no food, and there would be shortages and things. 
So, there was always a closet. Everybody had cans of tuna 
fish, cans of pineapple, cans of beans. But you open up that 
door and it was just beautiful. I liked to see that. Really 
beautiful!! But 1 always had this aesthetic appreciation of 
things in stores, not just objects, but in food stores. All the 
vegetables together. 

GC: What about the idea of gravity and weight, because it 
seems to me so evident in the works. Does it have to do with 
the idea of the image as a very heavy element? As if the 
present, the past, everything, whatever you do is heavy, not 
physically, but in the sense of profound? Heavy in a 
metaphorical sense. 

JD: You mean, was 1 conscious of doing something heavy? 
Well, I am not interested in something light. I don't want a 
snack! 

GC: That gravity means you are anchored to something. 
JD: Yeah. Yeah. 

GC: Lichtenstein and Warhol and others at that time, they 
were not anchored. They were dealing with perception in a 
different way, in a linguistic way, not in an emotional way. 
They were refusing any heavy element of the picture, while 
you and Claes were more sensual, completely physical. 
JD: Absolutely. 

CB: What was your relationship to artists such as Johns and 
Rauschenberg during the early 1960s? 
JD: Johns and I had somewhat of a friendship, for about a 
year or so, and we fell out, but not really fell out. But you 
know, he is a difficult man and I was a difficult man. So, it 
didn't work out so well. We really weren't meant for each 
other. 

CB: Were you closer to Rauschenberg during those years? 
JD: I was close to Bob, too, and Bob very generously says 
somewhere about Barge that he went home and painted after 
he saw Four Rooms {1962, fig. 109}, but that's because we 
would come over to people's studios. It was more of that, but 
it wasn't matey bar life, and it wasn't that we were great 
friends. 

GC: And did you feel separate from the previous generation? 
De Kooning and all these people. Did you visit them? 
JD: No, but de Kooning was so nice. 
CB: Did he come to your studio? 
JD: No. The first time I met de Kooning was at the 
vernissage of Sidney Janis's New Realists show. So, it must've 
been in the autumn of '62 or something like that. I 
remember he said to me, "You know, Dine," and he was 
really sweet about this, he said, "you know, you are a real 
painter. The way you put that paint on." He made fun of a 
lot of things, because it wasn't his way using these real 



objects and things, but he was always so generous and sweet 

about that with me. But I had no relationship with that 

other generation until a little bit later. I knew Motherwell a 

little bit, and Rothko, I met twice. And I knew Newman a 

little, too. 

GC: Were you going to galleries to see all the shows? 

JD: I'd see Rothko at every show. 

GC: What kind of relationship with the French did you 

have? 

JD: I met Yves Klein at Martha Jackson's gallery at openings 

for my shows and other artists' shows. I knew Arman, and I 

would see him quite a bit. He was very interested in 

knowing everybody, and he entertained a lot. So, I saw him 

quite a bit for a while, and then Tinguely I knew later. I 

knew Niki de Saint-Phalle. She came to my studio with 

Pontus Hulten and Billy Kliiver. 

CB: Did you know Daniel Spoerri? 

JD: He frightened me a little bit. 

CB: Did you come into contact with any of the assemblagists 

working on the West Coast? 

JD: I remember John Chamberlin had a show at Martha 

Jackson's about '62, and Billy Al Bengston was in town 

for that and I met him there, and we had a conversation, 

but Bengston was also a bit older. I was a yokel, and 

those guys were sharp. Bengston was sharp. He was sharp 

about his career, he was sharp about life; he was a bit of 

a Hell's Angel kind of person. I was nothing compared to 

these guys. 

CB: Did you feel you were part of a group? 

JD: The last time I felt comfortable in a group was when I 

was showing at the Reuben Gallery. 

GC: Because you were sharing all the experiences together? 

JD: Maybe. It was artists who I liked, and while we were all 

different, I was proud to be a member with them. I was 

proud to be showing there. 

GC: What kind of collaborative situation was it for you? 

JD: We were always there. It was like a clubhouse too. We'd 

go and meet there. Every time I'd go to see Anita Reuben, 

somebody else would be there, sitting there talking to her. 

That's the way it was. I'd be teaching at the Rhodes School, 

and then I would come after school. Take the subway down. 

GC: What about the label of Pop itself? 

JD: As far as Pop was concerned, I didn't want to drown in 

somebody else's movement. I wanted to be myself, too. I 

didn't want to be called part of this thing. I wasn't part of 

it. In the first place, it seems stupid to me. All my life I 

was a student of popular culture. I was involved with Pop 

music, I was involved with the radio, I was involved with 

television, I was involved with billboards, I was involved with 

commercial art. I was also involved with real objects. Don't 

forget I had grown up, since I was a little boy, with real 

objects. I did think the cereal box was beautiful. I really did. 

But that was my veneration of American advertising, too. 

All those things. The first Pop art things I saw were at the 

collector David Hayes's, somewhere on the Upper East Side. 

And there was Andy's work, and Roy's and mine, and just in 

this one house, these huge paintings. He was just buying 

wholesale almost. And I didn't think I had anything to do 

with it. I felt like a real outsider. And Cage would be there, 

and they would always say, "Oh, how marvelous this is. Oh, 

how marvelous! Isn't that marvelous!" What the fuck is 

marvelous? How do you know what's marvelous? 

GC: There was a decided shift in the art world right after 

The New York School, from the bar to the artist-run gallery. 

Artists like you began to incorporate their studios into their 

own galleries. For instance, the Green Gallery gave Claes the 



140 



possibility to do a show directly in the space; and Reuben, in 
your case, the same with Car Crash and other shows. 
JD: I never thought 1 was going to be able to support myself. 
I thought I'd always have to teach school or something. 1 had 
stopped teaching because Martha Jackson gave me a stipend 
when I joined her gallery. She gave me tour thousand dollars 
a year, and that's what I was making teaching, and tor that 
Mrs. Jackson got all paintings tor a hundred dollars. All 
drawings twenty-five dollars. So, she gave me tour thousand 
dollars a year for that. Fine with me. I thought. This is a 
great gift, but then I couldn't stand being at her gallery 
anymore. 

CB: Did Sidney Janis come to the show at Martha Jackson? 
JD: He and his wife, 1 larriet Janis, came in with Rudy Blesh 
and he said to me, "1 wish we could do something like this at 
the Janis Gallery." And so, Janis approached me in the 
summer of '62. He called me up and said "Could I visit you 
in East Hampton?" At that point LeoCastelli had already 
given me two hundred and titty dollars, and it was where I 
desperately wanted to be. And he said, "We can start this as 
an allowance toward pictures, and in the fall we'll start to 
work you in, probably. Now Janis's Gallery was like being at 
MGM in Hollywood, with artists like Giacometti and Philip 
Guston. This was everything that I was thinking about. 
These were the stars. I never even actually thought that 1 was 
going to make any money there. That was not the issue. It 
was this famous gallery, and he came out and he said, 
"Listen, you will be the first young artist I am going to take. 
I am going to take a lot more. 1 am making this New Realists 
show. Here is what I am going to give you. I'll give you an 
allowance each month." Now, I got two little kids, and 1 
didn't feel like living like shit. I didn't feel like living on the 
Bowery. I wanted to live someplace comfortable. Nothing 
grand. Leo was on the fence, because I gather Ivan Karp 
didn't want me in the gallery. Nobody at Castelli would 
make a decision. I needed a decision. I had little kids. I 
mean, I don't want to fuck around like this. Either I am 
going to teach school or not teach school. Particularly when 
Leo was dangling this thing tor me, you know, and then Janis 
comes up and that's what I did. I went to Jams and I Stayed 
there. I never regretted it. 1 was much more comfortable. 
CB: When you went to Janis, did it change your relationship 
with the artists who you were socializing with at the time? 
JD: I never socialized that way anyway. You have to 
understand that I was having bad mental problems. I mean 
bad phobic problems. I had swept under the carpet so much 
of my childhood without really dealing with it. I had 
invented myself without the help of parents really. So by 
about 1961, I am having trouble leaving the house, and I am 
developing agoraphobia, and claustrophobia, and vertigo, and 
I cannot drive a car halt the time, and 1 can't go on a bridge, I 
can't do anything, you know. So I start to see a psychiatrist in 
the fall of '62 and I could hardly go out and see people, and 
so I missed a lot of action in those years. I stayed home and 
worked. I was pretty much house-bound. And I stayed home 
mainly because I couldn't go out until about '64 when I sort 
of kicked in with the therapy. Painting saved me. It was the 
safest thing I could do, since I didn't have to relate to others. 
CB: Was there any sense of camaraderie between your peers 
that you could tap into cluriny this difficult time in your own 
life? 

JD: It stopped by '61. From the time I came to New York in 
the winter and was coming in from Patchogue in that winter 
of '58— '59, and through '61 there was this scene. With the 
Reuben Gallery and all. By the time 1 did A Shining Bed, I 
was out. 



GC: Did you feel you had .1 constant source ol support within 
the art world? 

]D: I got the most backup, the most support from Alan 
Solomon early on. He tame to my studio in 19(10. and he 
1 ame with a woman who was his assistant at tin t mie. 1 [e 
was tin- head ol the museum at ( ornell University, d\n\ he 
tame with a woman, Inez Garson. who bought / utilUJ 
[i9S9-6o, fig. -p] at that first \ isit: she bought it tor a 
hundred dollars. So, Solomons take was always that what I 
did — and he had been friends with Bob Rausc henberg in the 
'50s — what I did, he kept saying to me, is repressed dirty, 
dirty in the sense of smutty like that, dirty, ugly, diffi&lt; lilt, 
tough work. And he said, "You don't make it eas\ lor the 
viewer. Its nasty. You have this tendency to curb your natural 
instinct tor beauty or your natural glibness." And then I. ot 
course, almost put one arm behind mv back, and painted 
with a brush in my teeth it I had to, to please him, because 
he's the only person who was supporting me. I thought, I lere 
is the guy, he does understand some ot the psychic 
unhappiness I am living under, and he thought it was a 
virtue. 

CB: What work was going on in your studio at the time' 
JD: I was making a show tor Martha Jackson's gallery. I made 
Tht Red Bandana [1961, f\g. 71] Pearls [1961, tig. -2], Hair 
1 1961, fig. 66], Green 'ins in a Landscapi [1961, tig. 73], Coat 
[1961, fig. 74], all that sort ot objective work, and at the same 
time, I was making a whole other body ot work, the Tool 
pictures, which Ileana Sonnabend eventually took to Europe. 
GC: Where did you met Ileana in Europe, or in New 
York!' 

JD: I met Ileana through LeoCastelli or Bob Ratisc henberg. 
She was looking at new artists, and I remember she came 
with Michael Sonnabend. He was living on the West Side in 
his little brownstone one-room, which was just books 
everywhere and you couldn't walk. You never saw art. I mean, 
it was just a mess. But they really courted me, and they 
came around a lot. I remember they came to dinner and Bob 
came to dinner with her a lot, and she said, "I've got this 
idea. I want to take American art to Europe." She chose 
things for the show in Europe, And then suddenly 1 went to 
Janis. And that threw everybody into a panic, because then 
she couldn't control much. She wanted me to come tor the 
opening, but I couldn't get on a train or a car, let alone a 
plane, so I never went. I never went to Europe until '66. I 
looked to Europe and knew a lot about it, but I never could 
go until '66, when I took a boat.

GC: In the series of Bathroom pictures, the first clear action I 

see is a kind of Mondrianesque way of composing. Why do 

you need this structure to include the objects? Is it because 

of the idea of details, or because it is very symmetrical? 

JD: It's how I compose! When I was working on these 

pieces, I was in my late twenties, and I had looked at a lot of 

what we called in America "Neo-Plastic Painting" — 

Mondrian, etc. I found that an interesting way to compose a 

picture, and when you get a medicine chest (which is 

essentially a rectangle), and a hanging towel, and these other 

objects, it's a way to arrange them. Actually, if one makes 

that decision in a house, and you were the contractor for the 

house, I think you would probably say, "Well, the medicine 

chest goes here, the towel rack goes there," but you wouldn't 

jam them all together in one place, because it would be 

confusing. All these objects come out of my childhood, and 

when I say that, I don't mean just because I went and looked 

at this in the bathroom every morning. It's because they were 

primary objects that my family was selling. They had them 

on display in the stores. There were two stores — my father's 

and then my grandfather's. My father had been hired by my 

grandfather to run the smaller store. But the point is they 

were always displayed the same way, without art, in the most 

direct way. This was stuff that I lived with every Saturday 

when I went down there to work and all summer long as a 

boy. 

CB: Were you attuned to the display of objects? 

JD: Not just display, not in the Rauschenberg sense, like his 

Tiffany windows. This is the lower end of the scale. What I 

was attuned to, as the child/artist which I was, I was never in 

doubt that these things were all grist for my mill. They were 

all objects of affection for me, and just as if my family had 

been in the art-supply business, then I would've maybe only 

felt that way about tubes of paint or colors. Here I had color 

charts for house paint. Beautiful! I had toilets, sinks in 

beautiful white glaze. Beautiful! It all had to do with the 

object as an object of beauty to me. And that's why I 

composed it. 

GC: In your paintings, did you create a drawing for the 

pattern? 

JD: No, I just did it. I arranged it, and if it didn't work, I 

unscrewed it and put it somewhere else. 

CB: Were you trying to create a sense of mood or atmosphere 

in the Bathrooms? 

JD: Just to differentiate, to make variations on a theme. 

CB: Are all the rooms psychologically the same place for 

you? 

JD: As far as I am concerned, the place is right there. 

GC: Why do you keep the objects open, like the toilet paper 

hanging off the canvas or the protruding soap dishes? 

JD: I wanted it to be casual and human. 

GC: Are they invitations to act? Emotionally I have a feeling 

that I can take the toilet paper or soap, what have you, and 

it's part of the work — or was it for you just a kind of frozen 

momentum? 

JD: They are not frozen in time, because otherwise, I would 

have used jusr rectangles, not the objects. 

GC: Wiring the Unfinished Bathroom [1962, fig. 106] is 

extremely complex compared to the others from the series. 

JD: I was going to make another Bathroom painting, because 

it was all there in the studio. But instead, it became more 

informal. It became more occasional. I just had this idea that 

it was a "job," rather than a place. 

I .&lt; What is tin yellow square at the top of the 

&lt; omposition? 

JD: It's just a square of paint. I took masking tape, and 



masked off a square there, and I did the same thing with the 

red strip above the light, and that's all about composing. 

CB: Did geometric abstraction interest you in the same way 

that painterly expressionism did? 

JD: I always talk about Kline and de Kooning, and Rothko, 

but I never thought they wete very abstract. 

GC: And what about Walter Benjamin and the idea of the 

stripe? Did you know about it? 

JD: Oh, I knew it, but I never thought about that. It's just, I 

needed a stripe there. I felt I needed it. 

GC: I see a kind of convergence of three different periods of 

your work in this painting. The black panel, which is a 

reference; then the light; and all this kind of disorder. 

JD: You could say that. 

CB: The other thing I see in these works is your integration 

of drawing. Even the wire itself is a drawing, and then you 

have this scroll. So, in all of these works, it feels like you're 

introducing the idea of drawing. 

JD: Right. 

GC: Is the black outline in the work suppose to be your 

shadow? Is the drawing a shadow of you in a certain way? 

What does it mean for you to draw? Leaving your shadow? 

JD: No, leaving my traces. 

GC: But it's a physical shadow. It's very romantic. 

JD: "You could say that. I'd love it if it was. I don't know. 

CB: Is the medicine chest itself a self-portrait? 

JD: The whole thing is a self-portrait, because it's me not 

wanting to make a self-portrait, but not being able to help it. 

I use flesh paint, I use toothbrushes. I also felt that in using 

flesh paint, catching color right out of material, the flesh 

paint was a kind of found object itself, because it was a 

generic flesh — Caucasian, but generic. It's more like a doll's 

flesh; it's not the color of my flesh or your flesh. And so, for 

me, it was exciting to use that color. I used it in The Toaster 

{1962, fig. 100] and several other works as well as in Wiring 

the Unfinished Bathroom. 

GC: What about the idea of the inside of the cabinet? The 

toothbrushes, etc.? Were you conscious about being inside or 

communicating with these objects, especially in a cabinet? 

Was it a question of opening up the box, and projecting what 

could be inside? It was only an object? 

JD: It's an object we all experienced. I thought it would 

make an interesting painting. That's it. 

CB: In Car Crash you created a whole hospital environment, 

and then with the Bathrooms you invoke the medicine cabinet 

and another antiseptic environment. Was the hospital in 

some ways a safe haven for you? 

JD: No, it's dangerous. That's why I made Car Crash. 

GC: Were the children's rooms a way of recreating your 

childhood through a kind of self-analysis? 

JD: All these things came about because I had children 

when I was very young. In Child's Blue Wall [1962, fig. 108], 

that was Jeremy's lamp. Because I had these little kids, I 

remembered childhood more. And therefore things like 

Erector sets and other toys appear in Three-Panel Study for a 

Child's Room [Summer 1962, fig. 107]. 

GC: I noticed that in some of the works that precede these 

there is this kind of geometric figure that lies on the surface 

of the composition — a kind of three-dimensional rectangle. 

Had you started to look at Constructivism at the time? 

JD: There are Constructivist connections. I had already 

looked at Mondrian and Malevich a lot. 

CB: You often refer to the grid in works such as The 

Checkerboard {fig. 20], and A Color Chart [1963, fig. 121] as a 

grid, and the same with the medicine cabinets of the 

Bathrooms, which function on the plane of the canvas as 



156 



geometric abstract forms. 

[D: And as a way to get the mirror on the wall, which would 

idd another dimension to the painting. 

3C: Were you familiar with Rauschenberg's White Paintings 

it the time? 

[D: Probably not, because they were not available to be seen, 

ilthough I did know about them. 

~B: Was the scale of Four Rooms [1962, fig. 109] a 

breakthrough in your work, since you're activating space 

:here in a way you hadn't done since The House? 

[D: After that summer in East Hampton, I came back to 

^ew York and I went to town with the Bathrooms. The 

bathrooms led to Four Rooms. I just thought: lour panels, four 

■ooms. And I wanted to make a really beautiful painting. I 

vanted to recreate the surface of David Smith's sculpture by 

.ising an aluminum panel. I thought that it was beautiful the 

vay he polished stainless steel. I used aluminum and tried to 

:reate his surface. 

jC: The wall is still the primary element; it's not 

trchitecture. So you still read it as a two-dimensional 

tainting. 

ZB: Black Bathroom #2 [1962; see fig. 97] is another work 

vhere you oscillate between the two-dimensional quality of 

lrawing and the three-dimensional object. 

fD: I saw that sink, put it on the canvas, and it was obvious 

hat all it needed was some paint around it. 

jC: So you created this kind of dispersion of energy around 

t, this radiation. Steiner has this idea at the time that the 

lura of reality comes from inside you and it radiates outside 

nto the world. Your brushwork in these paintings remind 

ne of this notion. 

IB: You feel it happening in works as diverse as Car Crash 

i960, fig. 49], where the shroud is similar to the spray of 

vater in Small Shower #2 [1962, fig. no] and other works 

rom the period.

CB: Tell us how you came to paint such sensuous treatments 
of landscape as The Studio {Landscape Painting) [1963, fig- "^l 
and ndscape [1963, fig. 111]. 

JD: They are about weather, and nature. I made The Studio 
after I looked out my window where I was living, on the 

mnd floor apartment in the back of the apartment, when 
it was snowing, and it was black outside, and there were 
these big white flakes coming down. So I thought to myself, 
Why not make a painting that had elements of landscape, 
just elements of landscape, not wanting to make a landscape. 
And I just thought it would be a good idea to 
compartmentalize, like a color chart, like a glossary of terms, 
like a dictionary of landscape, but then also to include 
objects in the studio, like a little still life. And I made Long 
Island Landscapt in the summer of '63. The house wed rented 
in East Hampton by the railroad tracks had a big backyard 
and a barn, and I just wanted to make a landscape painting. 
Irs pretty realistic. I was thrilled to make this painting, 
because it was like expressing what I saw, the beauty of Long 
Island, before the rich people came. Right now, I am making 
a landscape in my studio. It's taken all this time to have the 
nerve to do it. 
GC: A real one? 

JD: I make it out of my mind, but I am having the greatest 
time. But as always, I look out of the window, I am totally 
involved with weather. All my life, I respond to weather. 
There is no such thing for me as bad weather. I like it all. 
CB: In 1963 what was your emotional state like? 
JD: I was not doing too well. It took a lot to get down to the 
studio to do this, but I remember being in the studio and 
doing and feeling great about it. 

CB: Did this in some way help you break from inside to 
want to go out? 

JD: No, but art has always been for me a security. It's been 
my hedge against depression. 

GC: What does a change of time or a change of emotion 
mean to you at the time? 

JD: It means for me another example of the divine. 
CB: After the landscapes, you began a series of Palettes, yet 
you did the first one in i960 in honor of your birth year, 1935. 
Why did you drop the subject and then pick it up again 
three years later? 

JD: Actually, I made a whole bunch of Palettes on paper in 
1962, but they were stolen from the studio where I made 
them, along with an actual palette, and they never turned 
up. The thieves broke into my studio and took all the works 
on paper, and the Bathroom paintings were in the midst of 
being worked on, so they took some of the objects off the 
paintings, and they ruined the backs of the paintings with 
Sti&lt; ks. I was so stupid in those days! My studio had been the 
young Socialist League before I began renting it, and I never 
' hanged the locks, so, one morning, I got there, and it was 
empty. I mean, I knew. My door was open. What's going on? 
The door is open; somebody came in. Very neat, there was no 
vandalism. They took the objects off very neatly, and they 
took all the- works on paper. So, I called the cops. And the 
&lt; ops thought I was the asshole. I am the artist, right? I felt 
like Id been raped, I really did. I never had an experience 
like rhis before. I was absolutely depressed. I ran home in my 
1 ar. By the time 1 got home, Sidney Janis had already called 
the newspaper, and there is Tom Wolfe sitting in my living 
room, not famous then, but there he was, Tom Wolfe, 
working for the I terald Tribune, which was the better paper 
in \&lt; w Ybrk, and vith a photographer. And I said, "Who are 
' W hai are you doing here?" I le wanted to talk about the 
robbery. I said, ( ret our of my house. I don't want to talk 



about it." He said, "No, no." And the photographer said, 

"No, you have to understand, this is Tom Wolfe. He's just 

done the obituary of e. e. cummings. He's a great writer." I 

said, "Get out of here. I've already been intruded upon once 

today. I don't want to see you." And finally they left, and that 

was that. Nobody found anything. Ever! I still look at 

auction catalogues . . . it's always in my mind. 

CB: And are any of the paintings that you did in '63 an 

attempt to redo the drawings that were stolen? 

JD: No. I was in the midst of making Bathroom paintings. I'd 

just come back from East Hampton in the fall of '62. 

CB: Where was your studio? 

JD: On the corner of Second Avenue and Fifth Street. 

CB: Was A 19 $5 Pa left [i960, fig. 26} the only painting you 

made of a palette before 1963? 

JD: No, there was another one, owned by Ted Powers. It was 

a colorful one, with a black background. One night, I showed 

it to John Cage, and that was the night he gave me his 

leather tie which I used in The Composer's Yellow Tie [ca. 1962, 

fig- 79 3 • 

GC: There is a sensuous element to most of the 1963 Palettes, 

and yet, like the cabinets in the Bathrooms, there is a feeling 

of sequence to them. And what about the idea of the double? 

Is it about reflection, or sequence? 

JD: Sequence, probably, since they are all so different. 

CB: You mentioned a palette that was stolen from your 

studio. Did you work with a palette to mix your colors when 

you were painting? 

JD: I used a palette, but I usually mix colors on the canvas 

or I mix them on the floor. The smaller palette in Red Palettes 

[1963, fig. 115] is a real one. Some of the Palette paintings are 

full of objects, real objects. 

GC: So the objects are your palette in a certain way? 

JD: Yes. 

CB: Your Color Charts [see figs. 121, 122} are so hard-edged 

compared to the Palettes, which have such expressionistic 

exuberance. So much of your work plays off the idea of 

vacillating between geometric abstraction and a more 

figurative abstraction, which can be considered different 

states of perception. And then you literally activate an entire 

room by introducing a stovepipe in some works, such as Two 

Palettes in Black with Stovepipe (The Dream) [1963, fig. 114] and 

Dream #2 [1963, fig. 123]. 

JD: It's a way to turn the corner too. I wanted to do more 

than just mechanics. 

CB: And unlike the Color Charts, which are very 

straightforward, the Palettes are quite complex. You don't 

know how to enter the work, and you don't know what's 

hidden and what's revealed. 

GC: And there is stratification in terms of the work's depth; 

you don't know which is background and which is 

foreground. And stratification in time, too. In ancient times, 

stratification meant time, history, all these kind of things. It 

seems to me that you stratify your own history by working 

with levels of cultural memory, contemporary memory, 

object memory, everything your memory constitutes as in 

between. 

CB: The Palettes of 1963 are so different from A 1935 Palett 

because of your practice of redoubling and recombining 

different states of perception. In fact, did Surrealist practice 

ever play a role in your work? 

JD: Well, I was interested in the first place as a natural 

inheritor of a tradition. Just like I am a natural inheritor of a 

Realist tradition. I mean, it was all part of me. But I never 

felt that I was a Surrealist. 

GC: You've often quoted Giacometti. The aspect of your 






work that seems to have found a source in Giacometti is all 

about obsessions. 

JD: Yes, about his obsessions. And about his purity and his 

life in art. I found that exemplary. And so I looked at 

Giacometti, like sometimes people look to Christian martyrs. 

GC: In the Palettes there is an invitation to look through. 

Because while the holes may be for holding the palette, the) 

become holes for looking deep inside the canvas itself. 

JD: I wanted to comment on art history, but also 1 am really 

at this point feeling like an outsider, and I am thinking to 

myself, I keep working like this, I am a maniac. I mean, 

people are going to put me away, why can't 1 relate? 1 can 

make a painting as good as Frank Stella or an abstraction if I 

wanted to, so in my most primitive goofiness, I put in these 

little holes. I mean, I used these things like an abstract 

artist. I wanted to be loved. 

CB: You were doing that in the Bathrooms, too. 

JD: Yeah. 

GC: But in the Bathrooms, there is a more controlled 

ambiguity. In the Palettes, is the idea of the hole an ideal pure 

form, or is it just a casual thing.-' 

JD: Casual. 

CB: Was your use of raw, unfinished materials, such as saw 

horses, wood planks, tree logs, etc., a response to 

Minimalism at the time? 

JD: I have a relationship to these materials, not just in the 

tools that you use on them, but in the materials themselves.

. ••- 



CB: What motivated you to begin the series of Bathrobe 
picture 

JD: Well, I had been seeing a psychiatrist for two, maybe 
two and a half years. I was focusing on myself, obviously, and 
I'd been trying to find a way to make a self-portrait besides 
just looking in the mirror. I thought there must be some 
other way to make a self-portrait. The Suits were an earlier 
attempt to make a self-portrait. So, before I did the 
Bathrobes, I made the two White Suits, beginning with White 
Si/it (Self-Port nut) [1964, fig. 125}. In that one, the suit has 
been superimposed on the Plexiglas, but underneath is a 
rectangle and a square. I actually put my psychiatrist in — 
there is a black panel, and there was a square and a rectangle 
in the relationship of the analysis. And there was Isometric 
Self-Portrait [1964, fig. 130], which is just a suit jacket, and 
Sihi r Chrome Jacket [1964]. So, I was looking for a way to 
make self-portraits. I guess I found it, actually. One Sunday, 
in the New York Times Magazine, I saw this ad for bathrobes, 
and it was a bathrobe with nobody in it. It looked like me. It 
looked like my physique. So I thought, If I use this, I really 
can make a miraculous self-portrait. And it was a found 
object, you could say. And that's how it began. 
CB: Did you feel that the Suits didn't quite work as self- 
portraits.'' 

JD: They did, but it's just that when I saw the bathrobe, it 
was more precise. It looked like I was truly in it. And 
therefore I felt I was destined to use it. 

GC: What I notice in White Suit #2 [1964, fig. 126] is that it 
sends some radiation, and there is a kind of Constructivist 
abstraction. 

JD: It is a way to make a person stand up and give them 
some support. 

GC: It's not the inside of your soul? 
JD: Not specifically. 

GC: What does the chain mean for you in Isometric Self- 
Portrait? 

JD: It's just something I had bought to exercise with. I 
mounted it on the wall, and then I put the chain in and I'd 
pull it. I once read a book about a psychological case study of 
a little boy who ... I forget what had happened to him, but I 
think he had no parents, or his parents wouldn't touch him 
as a child, so then as a teenager, you couldn't get near him, 
without him telling you, "Be careful when walking, you'll 
trip on the wires." He had all these imaginary wires coming 
off of him, going into the wall, imaginary walls, for energy. 
He was unable to live alone in his own body. I think in those 
years, I was unable to live alone without being scared. It's 
only in the last few years where I really felt that I was in my 
own head and reasonably comfortable getting out there. 
GC: So, it's the tool that you hook to yourself in a certain 
way. 

JD: In some way. Anel also it's a way to make structure for 
yourself. Listen, my worst nightmare is that I will melt like 
Black Sambo's tigers. 

GC: So, the dress also is something without structure. A kind 
of inflatable skin, without anything you could hold on to. 
CB: Why are the bathrobes empty? 

JD: They aren't. I never include the head, but the body is mine. 
GC: Why did you incorporate ropes and chains in many of 
these works [see figs. 126, 127, 130, and 132]? 
JD: I used to like looking at ropes and chains when I went to 
the sailing-supply store in hast Hampton. Some of them just 
appealed to me, and I'd figure out what I think I could use. 
The same thin /ith the other found objects in my works. 
That s how I ended up making Charcoal S elf-Portrait in a 
Cement Garden 1 196 \ fig 1 13], which I also did in East 



Hampton. I was driving by Agway, a farm-and-garden- 
supply store. And going by Agway, I checked it out, and 
there were these cement garden decorations broken outside 
on the ground. So, I bought them, and took them home, and 
put them in front of this drawing of a robe and made a self- 
portrait. It just seemed to work right for me. 
CB: Besides Four Rooms [fig. 109], where the painted chair 
remains on the floor, this appears to be one of the first times 
you associate an object not just with the canvas, so that you 
establish a sculptural presence apart from the painting. 
JD: That's not the way I was thinking about it at the time. 
This fell into place the minute I saw the objects — I knew 
that I wanted to do it this way. I was commenting on history, 
on memento mori. 

CB: So the "cement garden" is like a graveyard. 
JD: Yes. It's a graveyard. 

CB: Were you beginning to think about structure when you 
made Stephen Hands Path [1964/98, fig. 134] and Self -Portrait 
Next to a Colored Window [1964, fig. 131]? 
JD: I always thought about structure, but I never did 
anything with it until I experienced it. In Stephen Hands Path, 
I wanted to make a surface that was three colors, not a 
hundred. And I did Self-Portrait Next to a Colored Window in 
every different color that I could get from the color chart. 
Plus the window likewise — a real window that I bought at a 
lumberyard. I painted in the back. And then drew it here, 
the window next to it, and broke up the color. 
GC: Why such color at this stage? 

JD: Because I wanted to use every color of paint I had. It's 
the idea of the color chart applied to the Bathrobes. 
CB: You seem to have moved from brushwork to a more 
graphic treatment of line and color. 

JD: It's like poster art. It was a pleasure to use this great 
house paint. You just paint in coats with it. 
GC: So you're cleaning up your technique. I see a lot of 
direction in a piece like Stephen Hands Path, for instance. And 
in Self-Portrait Next to a Colored Window it's the idea of Color 
Field rather than Pop. It feels very modern and European. 
JD: You think so? Why? Tell me why! Because I always hear 
this. Not about this particular work, but about myself all the 
time. What's European about it? 

GC: I think it's a sort of richness of history, of coloring 
objects. It's going back to Titian, to all these artists, with 
this idea of richness, naturally done with a flat color, but the 
complexity is not objective. It's so unreal. You will never find 
an object like that, unless I am going in the direction of 
painting, and not in the direction of the object. That's the 
idea of Pop. Because you cannot define a popular object like 
that. It's so authentic. This idea of gravity on the surface. 
CB: In 1965 you performed Natural History [figs. 138 — 40]. It 
had been more than four years since you had done a 
theatrical work. Why did you go back to doing performance? 
JD: Well, because this time it wasn't for me. Because they 
came to me. Alan Solomon and Steve Paxton ran this New 
York Theater Rally, and it was Bob Morris and Bob 
Rauschenberg, and Oldenburg and me, and Whitman, and 
lots of dancers from the Judson Church. I resisted making 
the work for a long, long time, and everybody said, "You 
know, you should come." Then Solomon said, "You have to 
do something." I had been writing down my dreams for two 
years every day, and I took the dreams and made them into a 
long stream-of-consciousness prose piece. And I read them 
on tape. That was the soundtrack; it took a half an hour. It 
was extremely long for the audience, and extremely painful 
for me to hear. I just read the content of the dream into an 
audio. So, it was just continually going along like a narrative, 



192 



without really having subject matter. Car Crash was violent 
and expressive; Nat/mil History I felt was depressed and 
mannered. And I think I would've been happy )ust to play 
the tape, rather than going through .ill these machinations 
with these people there doing these different things. 
CB: How did you stage it? 

JD: It was in the round. Performed in a huge circle, aik\ I 
was in the center just smoking, just sitting there listening to 
the whole thing and smoking. The audience was around the 
sides. And the performers were all people I knew. Altogether 
it was more theatrical for me. It was also where I ended my 
friendship with Rauschenberg. We didn't speak tor rwent\ 
years because his friend Paxton tucked around with all my 
props, with my set — the tables and chairs that the 
performers sat on. He moved them away, and 1 screamed at 
him. He called me on the telephone, and he said, "You can't 
do this to me." And I said, "Yes, 1 can." I hung up the phone- 
again, and Rauschenberg was there, and he stopped talking 
to me, along with Paxton. Btit you know, it had no joy. All of 
the tour earlier performances had joy and and an ecstatic 
thing. This had no joy. This was cool. Not intellectual, but it 
was planned more. 
GC: Was the movement very slow? 

JD: Yes, very slow. It would be cool, because I have a way of 
being really cool, but it wasn't full of obvious expressionist 
themes, or robotic. It was an examination of my 
unconsciousness in public. 

CB: Was it the way you also behaved in therapy? 
JD: No, not at all. In fact, I was tree of therapy by then. 
CB: Did you feel like you were absent, just sitting in the 
chair? 

JD: Somewhat absent. Certainly self-revelatory, because 
of the meaning of experience. Also, the audience had an 
expectation. After all, five years before I had made four 
things, and through the year, everyone was on the floor 
laughing and excited, and then I ask them to come here and 
listen to my unconscious. When it was over, everything 
just stopped. 

CB: And you didn't expect the audience to react that way? 
JD: No. I was so involved with the text that I thought they 
would be blown away. But the audience was silent. Nobody 
said a word. And later somebody said to me, "It's very 
stolid." Solomon brought me out of retirement with this one. 
and I just thought, I am never doing this again. 
GC: Does remembering your early work torture you? 
JD: It's my social problem about getting along in this 
imaginary universe that I thought I was in called "the art 
world." Where of course I am still isolated by these works, 
because of their personal content, and here I am thinking 
that I am communicating something. These works are about 
the arrangement of objects. But it's also fragmentation. It's 
my idea of what was contemporary. I don't know what the 
hell I was thinking of, but of course here I am isolated in my 
little neurotic cocoon, here I am fighting a\u\ railing against 
Minimalism. Here I am in the same apartment house as Alan 
Solomon — he's living down the hall. So, 1 am seeing him 
every day almost. And he is talking to me about Castelli . . . 
he is the great Leo apologist. Here I am not with Leo. I am 
with Sidney, because of what we've talked about before, and 1 
am trying to be part of something, and yet, I am not part of 
anything except myself. This world I made.

CB: What led yon into sculpture? 

JD: I went into sculpture because of Boh Kulicke. In the 
'60s he was a framer. He's the man who invented the plastic 
box frame. At the time, he was working with Rosa Esman. 
And Rosa had this press, and she wanted to publish this Fop 
art box of objects. Segal did a plastic chicken; I did the 
Rainbow Faucet. That Faucet was sand-cast in aluminum. And 
through that we met this guy called Dave Bassinow. This 
guy was a genius in sand-casting. He lived in Philadelphia. 
That's where 1 made Air Pump [196s, tig. 146); that's where- 1 
made all of this sculpture. 
GC: What material were you casting from? 
JD: From plaster. And then it would be sand. It wasn't wax. 
GC: The surface is totally different from wax casts, 
JD: It's much rougher. They were not fine casters. These arc 
people who are casting plumbing pipes and things. 
GC: What is your feeling of doing this kind of three- 
dimensional work, in getting out of the canvas and making a 
standing object.-' 

JD: And making my own objects. It's the first time. And I 
felt really excited by this. It was energizing. 'Ilk Red Axt 
[1965, fig. 149], A Nice Pair of Boots [1965, fig. 137], A Bout 
Bench Ochre #2 [1965, fig. 113] — all those are ideas that I didn't 
have in my mind. They just came to me down at my studio. I 
put things together, I'd say, "Cast this." I'd put some more 
things together and cast them. 
GC: So were you just collaging things? 
JD: Yeah. Sometimes collaging. 
CB: Were some of them made from real objects? 
JD: Some are real objects, others are me making things with 
plaster down at the sculpture studio. Plus, in a corner I am 
making the A.R. at Oberlin paintings {1966, figs. 147, 148], a 
series of paintings that I named with the initials of a 
troubled student I'd met when I was an artist-in-residence at 
Oberlin College for a week, and who I identified with 
somewhat. They are not about her, but about a field of blue. 
I used car/truck paint, and I sprayed it on. I never sprayed on 
a huge ground before, and it was like the characters appeared 
on the stage again — on the real blue. I sprayed them with a 
compressor, in a corner down there, where we worked in this 
big studio foundry, and I am using the objects, crap that I 
found on the floor from the sculpture. And a lot of things art- 
casts of my own arm, my own hand. 

CB: So, the objects in the A.R. at Oberlin paintings are also 
being done at the same time you're doing the sculpture. 
JD: And the objects were cast on purpose. 
GC: What is the difference for you between putting real 
shoes in My Tuxedo Maki 1 an Impressivt Blunt Edgt to tht Light 
[1965, fig. 141] and casting these objects in 1966? 
JD: Well, the real shoes are more ephemeral. They are going 
to go. The bronze is not going to go. But I don't think I was 
doing it for that. I think it was a collage technique. 
GC: Just the difference of material. 
JD: I like changing material. I like material itself. 
CB: You'd said that you were painting with one- hand tied 
behind your back that same year. Did the sculpture allow 
you to bring both hands forward in the creative a&lt; t? 
JD: The sculpture gave me a much bigger breadth of vision. 
Much bigger. 

CB: Did you feel more permission to work figuratively in 
sculpture than you did in painting? 

JD: No, it's still fragmented. 1 never got much feedback on 
the sculpture, but 1 loved it. 1 thought it looked great. It was 
JUS1 what I wanted to do then.

: What did it mean for you to move from using objects in 
r paintings to transforming them into a traditional 
sculpture? 

JD: When I first cast an object for a work, my assistant at 
the time said to me, "I don't understand why you cast it. 
Why didn't you just keep the regular objects?" And I told 
her that by casting them, you neutralize the objects and then 
you bring them back with your own power, without the 
history they had before in a lot of ways. I think that's what it 
really is. 

CB: Does it go back to your switch from using junk in the 
earliest pieces to liking new objects better? 
JD: I'd rather put my own history on it, and it's a way to 
make a tabula rasa sort of thing. 

GC: Does The Ribbon Machine {1965, fig. 144} relate to the 
Color Charts [see figs. 121, 122]? 

JD: It relates to that, but also, I was sick in bed, and I 
remember I always had paper on the wall next to my bed in 
those years, and I would draw in the morning there, and I 
saw the pelvis, probably the female pelvis, as two wheels with 
an axle in between. I just started to draw the pelvis and then 
I guess refined it to these two wheels, like the Giacometti 
chariot, in a way. But then I thought to myself, Wouldn't it 
be beautiful against the aluminum to have cloth? The 
ribbons are very alive! They are — it's a horrible thing for me 
to say — like Morris Lewis. 

GC: So you used the ribbons like hair, on the sides? 
JD: Yeah. The two things, like at the angle or something. 
And it's just one of those crazy ideas, goofy ideas. That's all. 
But it was also the same way I loved the Brooks Brothers 
suits. I would go to Brooks Brothers and look at the fabric; 
and to this day, it's the same thing as paint charts, as color 
charts. It's the lineup of things in a serial way, like if one 
color is beautiful, then two is more beautiful. It's like "more 
is more." 

GC: And why the red in the sculptures? What does that 
color mean? 

JD: I always go to red. It's my favorite color. 
GC: Many of your sculptures function as furniture. Were you 
going back to reality in a certain way? In the paintings, you 
took reality and used it, and now you reverse its logic in the 
sculpture? 

JD: Sort of, but also it's probably one of those things that 
probably came to me in some mild dream, to have this boot 
bench. And I took these motorcycle boots, cast them, and 
then I cast a board and I welded it. It seemed so simple. And 
I know that you could say it comes from Surrealism. 
CB: There are several sculptures where the tools no longer 
just define the edges, but become the ground itself, such as 
Double Hammer Doorway [1965, fig. 143}. 
JD: Double Hammer Doorway was the first time I made it 
more than a tool itself. Instead of trusting just one little 
hammer. I found a way to elongate because of the sculpture, 
it allowed me to elongate and to integrate the shaft of the 
hammer into this pole, so that it's one long thing. This 
Double Hammer Doorway is bigger than me. You could walk 
through it. The Red Axe [1965, fig. 149] is the same thing. 
GC: There are two possibilities you considered: the dream of 
any vision that you are doing, you add the vision to reality; 
but also you are caking something out of yourself — you 
know, you get rid of. So there are two realities. One you add 
to reality, and one you get rid of yourself. Just the idea that 
yon have tons oi dreams, but when you realize one, you take 
off. You arc getting rid oi one. and you have tons of them. 
I low do you seta 1 what dreams to act on? How do you know 

what tO get rid of? 



JD: Some dreams one gets rid of because you can't sit with 
them, they are so disturbing that the human psyche doesn't 
allow it. It's the way for you to remain alive, otherwise it 
would kill you. Others you get rid of, because they don't 
interest you or you don't understand them. And it's a 
question of just time, too. You don't keep it. 
CB: Do you have serial dreams, where you dream the same 
thing? 

JD: No, but I have different dreams with the same setting. 
Most of my dreams take place in a house, which is me, which 
is my unconscious. And the house has various levels. They 
frequently take place in the basement, depending on how I 
am feeling, what I am talking about. 
CB: Was it when you were you beginning to fight this 
resistance to be a figurative painter that you started to think 
more about leaving New York? 

JD: I was thinking about it because in '65 I was thirty years 
old, and I'd never been to Europe. As I said, I couldn't travel. 
Couldn't fly, couldn't do this. And even when I went to 
Europe the first time, I went by ship. I went because a print 
publisher paid the way, and said, "Come and make a 
portfolio." And I thought: Great! Nancy and I took the boys. 
Nick was one year old, not even one year old; he'd just been 
born. We went to London by boat and stayed six weeks. 
Robert Fraser rented a house for us. I felt like I'd been let out 
of jail. I became a human! I mean, I met everybody that was 
there. They were so generous to me. Hamilton and Hockney 
and Paolozzi, who was a monster. You ever see him?! He 
absolutely looks like a monster, too! But he's an exciting 
mind. A really smart man! And they were seductive with me. 
They wanted to hear what I had to say. And I was easy! I 
went out every night. It was cheap. You had a baby-sitter. 
You had nannies. We went everywhere. I knew everybody. I 
had the greatest time! And after six weeks, I had to go, and I 
was really unhappy. Went home, and I changed. It changed 
my life. It was the spring of '66 that I went. The fall of '66, 1 
went to Cornell to teach. I left New York because Janis said 
that I owed him forty thousand dollars. Because I had been 
drawing on twenty-five hundred dollars each month to live, 
and plus he lent me eight thousand dollars to buy a house in 
East Hampton. It was all signed with notes and things, but I 
thought, Jesus! Forty thousand dollars! I don't think I owe 
him that. And he got very unpleasant with me. He said, 
"You know, we have to face up to these things, and blah, 
blah, blah." This was so typical of me at that time. I didn't 
talk it over with Nancy, I didn't talk it over with anybody. I 
said to myself, "I can't be in chattel, I cannot be like this. 
What I am going to do is not give him any paintings. I am 
not going to paint." So, just at that moment I got a phone 
call from Cornell, asking me to come for the year. So, I said, 
"Sure." I took it. So, I made ten thousand dollars that year, 
and I was able to go to Cornell, and everybody went to 
school, and blah, blah, blah. 

CB: Had you taught on the college level before that year? 
JD: I had taught at Yale once a week for a year, in '65, with 
Tworkov. But really, I was teaching really heavy duty at 
Cornell, and it was a big experience for me being there. After 
a year I moved to London, because the print dealer owed me 
nine thousand bucks. So, I picked it up in London, and we 
lived for a whole year on nine thousand bucks, because 
London was like Mexico then, it was so cheap. Really poor! 
So, when I went to London, I had a friend who was a lawyer, 
who said, "You don't have to live like this. Worried about 
Janis, owing him forty thousand dollars. Let me call his 
lawyer." I didn't have a lawyer. I said, "Okay" He calls his 
lawyer and they had meetings, and meetings, and meetings.

And we got all the paintings back. Then Jams owed me maybe 
twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. The lawyer dropped 

dead by the way. My lawyer killed him, I think. I le jusi 
dropped dead one day of a heart attack. And Jams said, "No 
hard feelings." But meanwhile, then I was launched into a 
European life. And 1 never really looked back alter that. It's 
where I always was comfortable in my skin, m Europe. It just 
seemed right for me. The sky looked like- where 1 could be 
myself. Really, I found myself in Europe, in London. 
CB:. What were the first works that you did in Europe? 
JD: When I first went to London, and stayed tor six weeks, 
Paolozzi said to me, "Let's collaborate. I said, "Wh.it a great 
idea. I never thought of that," but it was in the spirit of what 
was going on there. 1 was collaborating with these people. By 
interacting with humans for the first time in a long time. So 
what he did was, he would give me collage material that he 
had collected, and I would collage it. And I guess it was the 
spirit of the times, but all 1 made was these very big penises 
that I painted in gouache, or I painted rather realistic 
vaginas, which were isolated from the human body. They 
were just vaginas, with his collage material. Robert I rase r 
had a show of this work, and it was confiscated by the- police. 
When I moved there, all I did was print. I didn't paint 
because of Janis for that first year, '6-. I wasn't painting then, 
so I wouldn't have to give Jams anything. The next year, in 
September, we moved into a house, a very grand house in a 
famous square, Chester Square, owned by a friend of mine, 
who was uncomfortable being rich and an artist. She was a 
liberal American woman, who was from a very rich family. 
She moved to a little worker's cottage that made her feel 
better, and she said that as long as you pay the taxes, or 
whatever it was, they weren't very much, you could live there 
tree for a year. So, we lived with no furniture in this huge 
mansion in Chester Square in Belgravia. And we tore the 
place up. My kids tore it up. We played baseball in the 
hallway. There were windows broken. And I painted in a 
huge drawing room. It was there in the autumn of 196S that I 
made the first Namt Painting [1968-69, fig. 155]. Ugo Mulas 
came because I knew him from the Solomon days in New 
York, he came and photographed me painting the Name 
Painting. And I started to really seriously write poetry. So, I 
wrote every day like a prayer. Every day 1 would write. Then 
I got to know a lot of poets and small-press book publishers. 
Really good typographers and great guys. One who was an 
American expatriate, and had been in the Second World 
War, a wonderful man, called Asa Benvenisti. He had a press 
called Trigram, and he published a book of my poems, and 
we were very friendly. Plus, 1 had a dear friend there called 
Rorie McEwan. He was a Scottish nobleman, but also an 
Indian musicologist, and a botanical painter. Wry unusual 
amateur man who was a great guitar player. He knew all 
these musicians, and I spent many evenings with everybody I 
could think of. Beatles, and Everly Brothers ... I mean. 
Rock n Roll was very big. Plus, classical Indian music ians. 
He had concerts. I had a life there. American and French and 
Italian poets were coming through all the time for 
conferences. I saw poets all the time in the friendliest way. 
There was no rancor, no jealousy, no stnv ing among the 
artists. Because there was no money! There is nothing to 
lose! Easy to be a friend when there is no money involved. 
CB: What was the impetus behind the- Namt Wmitni^' 
JD: Well, I thought to myself, I can remember everyone I 
ever met in my life. So that's what I tried to do. 1 went over 
my whole life and I wrote the names of everyone who I knew 
and who I met. 
GC: So, you become an archivist of yourself. 



JD: Yeah, I did The reason tor the second \ was 

bet ause 1 wasn't finished. Its a &lt; ontinuation. The- first 
begins with mj grandpa and m\ grandmother, and goes 
from when I was bom m [935 until [965 It s just charcoal on 
raw canvas. The second one lias more paint on it, ai ■ 
from 1965 to 1969. Ea&lt; h ol them took about a month to do. 
( ■( So, you consider it a kind ol visual sc roll Or was it just 
an 1 in el lee tual dei ision? It's ver) I onceptual, in a certain 
way. And it's verj emotional. 
JD: Its emotional and conceptual, u s And sometimes I 

realized I made mistakes about when I nut someone-, and 1 
liked Icav ing the mistakes I was building up a patina in a 

e ertain way. 

CB: Did the work fun&lt; tion like a draw ing to you. 

JD: Yes, it is like- a drawing. It looks like Monet, too. a little bit 
GC: The year 196s was a kind ol a magi&lt; al date tor your 
generation. What arc your recollections? 
JD: I was always against the war in Vietnam. I was in 

London, but 1 was in Paris when tht\ were throwing bombs 
and tear gas. 1 was unable- to get out ol Paris, and finalh the \ 
bused us to the- arm) base, and (lew us out on a little plain 
And 1 remember I bought a bottle- ol vodka on the- plant I 
was so scared. And it landed on grass in an air field in the 
South of England. I felt alive- in London. And I felt it was a 
sexual moment. London was verj sexj then Verj sexy. 1 

mean, not absurdly It re al K was h was like the first tunc 
you saw a mini skirt lor instance. It was realh something. 
Thej were breaking out. It was like- a real revolution. 
CB: Did you have representation in London? 
JD: Just Ileana Sonnabend in Pans. But Ik-ana wasn't 
showing much, because I wasn't giving her anything. I 
extricated myself from Janis in tall ol 68, and then I started 
to work in Chester Square. We lived in( hester Square for 
three years. And I started to work there-, and I made a 
number of paintings, including Colour of tht Month oj August 
{1969. fig. is &gt;}■ 

CB: Did the spoken language ol Natural History [figs 
138—40] prompt you to embark on the Namt paintings' 
JD: No, 1 started to understand that 1 have a feeling tor 
language. And I have— Robert Crcelcy always Says about 
me- - I have this \ctv particular relationship to words and to 
language-, which is different from a lot ol people. I think he 
is implying. And I see- words as objects, too. that I can use 
and manipulate and place- around. M\ technique ol writing is 
the same- as m\ tee hniquc- ol even thing. It's like pie k and 
choose — it's a collagist technique. I've taken to writing 
actually On big walls now. And then 1 ean look at it. aiul

CB: Did you always edit yourself? 

JD: Always. It you can do it great the first time-, you'll do it 
better the next time. So. I usually rub out. which is a wa\ ol 
editing; and I am determined to make- something work, so I 
make a silk purse out ol a pig's ear It s an al( hemic al idea 
GC: The process ol the difft rent stages 
JD: Bringing things to &gt; ons&lt; iousness. 
CB: And that works both in paintings and in the draw ing? 
I'D: And writing. And in draw ing, and in painting. I s&lt; rape, I

most ol the time- I take it out. And then I go again.

A Conversation with Jim Dine, Clare Bell, 

'sedon a series of discussions that took 
/'• \i, 1998 m New York City. 



JD: In 1967 I was not painting, but I was printing all the time; 
every day I was printing. Because in the first place, I was tired 
of being alone. I am a very good collaborator. I enjoy it. And 
printing is a sociable thing to do. You hang out with the 
printers, you have a good time, you talk, you change. And 
I was getting a lot of ideas. And the printmaking informs 
everything. I mean, they all inform each other. For me, it's 
all the same. 

CB: How did you come to use the heart as a motif in your work? 
JD: There was a painter named Norman Kantor, I think he 
was called, in the late '50s, who made a heart and a red cross 
and a lot of other signs like that in a little show on Tenth 
Street, and I never forgot it. I thought it was very effective 
against the ground. And then when I was asked to design the 
Midsummer Night's Dream for the Actor's Workshop in San 
Francisco, I incorporated it as a kind of symbol. So, it's 
something. It struck a chord with me. I thought it was as 
good a symbol as any to hang all my paint on, hang my 
landscape on, and to work in and out of, to keep the 
interpretation loose, could be a lot of things. It seemed to me 
a universal symbol. And I don't mean just for love. Because in 
a certain way it is an abstraction of a lot of things. It's a 
human form. And it's pushing the interpretation if you say 
that a human heart looks like this, but this does come from 
the idea of a human heart. 

CB: What prompted you to pay homage to American trompe 
l'oeil painting in Five Chicken Wire Hearts (for James Peto) 
[1969/98, fig. 154}? 

JD: I had this idea of cutting hearts out of chicken wire. At 
that time, I didn't feel I needed to make a painting. I felt I 
didn't need the support. It's a tableau to be looked at. A 
diorama. 

CB: Did you feel at this point that you just didn't need paint? 
JD: I didn't want paint on this piece. I wanted color to come 
from the object. 

GC: In all of your early works where you utilize existing 
material, did you use these objects because there was a 
freedom in using them, or was it an intentionally radical 
gesture for you? 

JD: I realized I wanted to be a modern man, make modern 
art. I saw all that stuff on the street as a vast studio. You 
could use everything. That's the thing that struck me — that I 
could use anything. Anything! When I found the bedspring 
that I used to make Bedspring [fig. 58}, I didn't see it as a 
bedspring. I saw it formally as this mysterious object that 
metaphorically could be turned into something that was 
anonymous, but then became personal. If I picked up what I 
considered neutral objects, they lost their neutrality when I 
put my hand to them, or when I put them in conjunction 
with something else, whatever that means. Duchamp was 
very ... I am not a Marcel-man. I am not intelligent enough 
for that; I do not have that kind of intellect, nor do I have 
that rarefied sensibility. I am refined in another way, I think. 
But I was more pleased to be verified. I mean, he gave me 
some reason that I could say, "Oh, look at that. That guy put 
a toilet there!" Now, he was making a joke. He was also 
saying, "Fuck you!" I never did anything to say "Fuck you!" I 
never ever thought this was a protest against my bourgeois 
upbringing. I never thought what I did was a protest against 
anything. I only did what I had to do to get the work out. 
That's all I did. I did it so I could be an artist, so I could 
make what I thought was art. I never did it for social reasons, 
for political reasons. I was put here by God to be an artist, 
and I've tried to fulfill that destiny. That's all.

"I believe that exposure can be used as a medium and I was 
totally pleased with what I did. It was completely successful 
because it was about exposing yourself, making it difficult for 
the audience through exposure, asking them to relate to you 
rather than you relating to them. " 
(Jim Dine, 1966)

Chronology 

Kara Wander Weg 

This chronology was based on the recollections of the artist and a 
variety of other sources, many cited in the Select Bibliography. 
Also, Joseph Jacobs, Curator of American Art at the Newark Art 
Museum, kindly shared his own research. Marco Livingstone 
graciously allowed the use of an advance copy of his book Jim 
Dine: The Alchemy of Images (New York: Monacelli Press, 
1998); and Marcus Ratliff provided invaluable information, 
particularly concerning the early years of the Judson Gallery. 



1935 

June 16: James Lewis Dine is born in Cincinnati, Ohio, son of 
Stanley and Eunice Cohen Dine (his brother, Tom, is born in 
Cincinnati on February 29, 1940). Dines grandfather, Morris 
Cohen, owns a hardware store there; his father owns a smaller 
one across the Ohio River in Covington, Kentucky. Dine 
works at both stores during his boyhood summers, an 
experience that will be reflected in his art. 

1946 

Dine takes his first art class at the Cincinnati Art Museum 
with Carlos Cervantes, a Mexican-American veteran of World 
War II. Daily class assignments include working outdoors 
with poster paints on manila paper. Dine views the museum 
collection, and later in life he will remember many of the 
works he sees there, including paintings by Paul Cezanne and 
seventeenth-century Spanish artist Francisco de Zurbaran. 
He will also recall that a reproduction of nineteenth-century 
American painter Frank Duveneck's The Whistling Boy, 1872, 
displayed in his grandparents' house, affected his artistic 
development. 

1947 

Dines mother dies of cancer. 

Fall: Dine enters Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati. 

1948 

Dine studies watercolor painting at the studio of artist 
Vincent Taylor in Cincinnati. 

June: Dines father remarries. 



1951 

An adversarial relationship with his stepmother compels 
Dine to move into the home of his maternal grandparents in 
Cincinnati. Dines grandfather teaches him carpentry, 
mechanics, and sewing. He begins making art in the 
basement of the house, painting over old canvases and on 
wooden paint stirrers. 

1952 

Dine sees reproductions of works by Georges Braque and 
Pablo Picasso that inspire his fascination with objects affixed 
to the canvas. Works that impress him include several guitar 
papiers colles and Picasso's painted bronze sculpture Glass of 
Absinthe, 19 14. 

1953 

Dine takes evening classes with artist Paul Chidlaw at 
The Art Academy of Cincinnati. 

Summer: Dine graduates from Walnut Hills High School. 

Dine works as a camp counselor in Freyberg, Maine. During 
a vacation he travels to New York and visits the Museum of 
Modern Art, where Larry Rivers's painting Washington 
Crossing the Delaware, 1953, is on view; it makes a great 
impression on Dine. 

Fall: Dine enters the College of Applied Arts at the University 
of Cincinnati. 

1954 

Dine purchases Paul J. Sachs's Modern Prints and Drawings: A 
Guide to a Better Understanding of Modern Draftsmanship (1954). 



*3* 



The book includes reproductions &lt;&gt;t works by German 
Expressionists such as Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, 
and Emil Nolde that influence Dine. 

Fall: Dine transfers to the College of Arts and Sciences at the 
University of Cincinnati. 

1955 

January: Dine transfers to Ohio University m Athens, Ohio. 

Dine begins reading Art News and is particularly interested 
in works by Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg, and 
Kurt Schwitters that he sees in the magazine. 

September: Dine leaves Ohio to Spend the fall at the S( hool 
of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston studying graphic arts, 
life drawing, design, art history, and painting. 

1956 

Dine returns to Ohio University from Boston. He studies and 
copies Old Master drawings and practices life drawing. At 
least once a month, he makes the ten-hour drive from Athens 
to New York to visit art galleries. 

1957 

June 16: Dine marries Nancy Minto on his twenty-second 
birthday. 

Dine earns a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Ohio University in 
June and enters the Master of Fine Arts program at the 
Graduate College there in the fall. 

1958 

Dine writes to artist Lester Johnson in New York, expressing 
admiration for his work, which features abstract treatments 
of figurative motifs. 

April 22: Allan Kaprow performs his first Happening (a 
combination of environmental art and theater in which the 
audience becomes an integral part of the events) at Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Seeing his work 
as affiliated more with objects than performance, Kaprow 
describes the subsequent Happenings he orchestrates as 
"painting in the shape of a theater." Although the objectives 
of the two artists are separate, Kaprow's avant-garde 
performance works — a step beyond the static medium of 
abstract painting — will profoundly influence Dine. 

June: Dine leaves the Graduate College following his required 
solo show. His exhibition of paintings and assemblages is 
very unpopular with some students and residents of Athens, 
and several students deface the works. 

Dine and Nancy move to a house in Patchogue, Long Island, 
New York. Both acquire teaching positions at local 
elementary schools, Dine as the art instructor at the Bay 
Avenue Elementary School. He takes Crayola crayons from 
the classroom and experiments with melting them to use as .1 
painting medium. 

Late summer: Dine and Nancy begin to make the- two-hour 
car trip into Manhattan three or four times a week to 
socialize with other artists working in the city, including 
Johnson and Red Grooms (Johnson introduces Dine to 
Grooms, a student of his).

series of drawings in 1959, the painting Car &lt; rash, 19 
(fig. 49), and his 19C10 performance Car Crash 'see November 
i960).

and pouring it over his head. Other Spex participants include 
Higgins, Al Hansen, Kaprow, Oldenburg, and Whitman. 

March: The March i960 issue of Art News contains critic

him to quit teaching and locus exclusively on making work. 
Dine accepts her offer and joins her New York gallery.

Dine suffers from agoraphobia and vertigo, psychological 
problems that stem from a difficult childhood. Although 
these problems will later be treated through psychoanalysis, 
they prevent him from traveling outside New York until 
1964. 

Dine begins combining articles of clothing with paint on 
canvas in works such as Orange Tie (fig. 68), Red Suspenders

Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, during the 1966-67

exhibition Nancy and I at Ithaca, on view at the Andrew

Robert Fraser Gallery. Exhibited are collages created through

Dine has designed. 

January 14— February 12: Dine is part of a three-person show 
along with Oldenburg and Segal at the Art Gallery of 
Ontario, Toronto. In his essay for the exhibition catalogue,

organized by Solomon, is held at the United States Pavilion 
of the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal. Dine creates a 
thirty-five foot mural for the show, which also includes

Lichtenstein, Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Rauschenberg, 
and others.
