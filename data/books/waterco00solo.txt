PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 




Vasily Kandinsky is a central figure in the development of twentieth- 
century art. More than any other painter, with the possible ex- 
ception of Piet Mondrian, he is identified with the transition from 
representational to abstract art. Kandinsky, who was born in Russia 
in 1866, did not begin his career as a painter until the first decade of 
our own century. He made his most original and important contri- 
butions to modern painting and aesthetic ideas in Munich between 
1908 and 1914. After his return to Russia upon the outbreak of 
World War I, the artist worked for the revolutionary government, 
organizing cultural institutions based upon modern ideas. When 
the new Soviet government became hostile to avant-garde art, Kan- 
dinsky left his homeland once more for Germany and accepted a 
teaching position at the Weimar Bauhaus. He was forced to leave 
Germany again in 1933, when the Nazis closed the Bauhaus. This 
time the artist found refuge in Paris, where he spent the last eleven 
fruitful years of a creative and influential life. 

The sequential progression of Kandinsky's revolutionary oeuvre 
is exceptionally clear and illuminating. His early work is rep- 
resentational and shows affinities with inherited Post-Impression- 
ist modes. Gradually and to a certain degree echoing the innova- 
tions of the contemporary French Fauves, Kandinsky attenuated the 
forms in his paintings and prints for decorative and expressive pur- 
poses. These forms, still rooted in the art of the Jugendstil movement 
and popular paintings on glass, ultimately lost their identity as rep- 
resentational images in the most radical departure in the history of 
twentieth-century art. Kandinsky proclaimed the independence of 
form and color from recognizable subject matter in his art and in 
his writings early in the second decade of our era, when others like 
Mondrian, Malevich, Kupka and Delaunay were moving towards 
similar conclusions. Thus, Kandinsky was not alone in achieving 
this revolutionary formulation, but the inventiveness and original- 
ity, the authority and strength of his work made him a leader in the 
development of a new artistic style. The same intellectual integrity 
and courage that assured this position of leadership before World 
War I later enabled him to invent new modes and exert a decisive 
influence during his years at the Bauhaus. During this Bauhaus 
period the expressiveness of the earlier work gave way to an em- 
phasis upon geometric structure, as painterly intuition was con- 
trolled by carefully established systems. The emotional detachment 
and the freedom from dogmatic attitudes which mark the works of 
the last years in Paris make these paintings and watercolors par- 
ticularly moving. 



The intimate medium of watercolor reveals to an extraordinary 
degree the evolution of Kandinsky's significant artistic accomplish- 
ments. This exhibition of fifty watercolors has been selected from 
the extensive holdings of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
and The Hilla von Rebay Foundation. "With the cooperation of the 
Rebay Foundation, whose collection has been on deposit at the 
Museum since i&lt;-;~o, it has been possible to represent the range of the 
artist's development from 191 1 to 1940. We are pleased to share the 
treasures of the Museum and the Rebay Foundation with the fol- 
lowing institutions which are participating in our traveling exhibi- 
tion: The Baltimore Museum of Art; the High Museum in Atlanta; 
The Cleveland Museum of Art; the David and Alfred Smart Gallery 
of the University of Chicago; the Honolulu Academy of Arts; the 
Portland Art Museum in Oregon; the University Gallery of the Uni- 
versity of Florida in Gainesville; and the Ackland Art Center of the 
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. 

We are grateful to Louise Averill Svendsen, Senior Curator at the 
Guggenheim Museum, and Vivian Endicott Barnett, Associate Cur- 
ator, who organized and selected the exhibition. Their sensitivity to 
Kandinsky's work is apparent in the choices they have made as well 
as in the essays they have contributed to this catalogue: Mrs. Svend- 
sen's knowledgeable historical account and Mrs. Barnett's scholarly 
and perceptive analysis of Kandinsky's watercolor techniques, the 
first essay published on this subject. We are most indebted to Hans 
Konrad Roethel who graciously provided information and Kenneth 
C. Lindsay who generously made his material accessible. Armin 
Zweite, Rosel Gollek and Jelena Hahl-Koch at the Stadtische Gal- 
erie im Lenbachhaus in Munich assisted immeasurably by making 
works available to Mrs. Barnett for study, as did Christian Derouet 
at the Centre National d'Art ct de Culture Georges Pompidou in 
Pans. The expertise of Marjorie B. Cohn, Conservator of Works on 
Paper at The Fogg Art Museum, was essential to Mrs. Barnett's dis- 
cussion of the artist's techniques. Also extremely helpful were John 
E. Bowlt, Charles W. Haxthausen, Axel Janeek, Rose-Carol Wash- 
ton Long, Clark Poling and Peg Weiss. The artist's widow, the late- 
Nina Kandinsky, kindly gave Mrs. Barnett permission to study the 
Handlists. Joan M. Lukach and Robert Grele of The Hilla von 
Rebay Foundation provided Mrs. Svendsen with much information. 
Within the Museum the following staff members deserve particular 
thanks: Angelica Zander Rudenstine, Research Curator, for her im- 



portant research on Kandinsky's oils in the Guggenheim's collec- 
tion; Dana Cranmer, Assistant Conservator, for answers to many 
technical questions; Carol Fuerstein, Editor, who intelligently edited 
the catalogue and handled its production; Susan B. Hirschfeld, Cur- 
atorial Coordinator, for her able assistance in seeing the publication 
through the presses; and Christine Poggi, Curatorial Fellow, and 
Susan Alyson Stein, Hilla Rebay Fellow, for their research. 

Finally, our very special thanks are reserved for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, which generously provided funds for this 
exhibition. The continuing and vital support of the Guggenheim 
Museum's projects by the National Endowment for the Arts is 
hereby gratefully acknowledged.

KANDINSKY, HILLA REBAY AND 
THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM 



by Louise Averill Svendsen 



The richness of the two sources from which this exhibition is de- 
rived—the collections of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and 
The Hilla von Rebay Foundation— is no historical accident. For it 
was Hilla Rebay who first introduced Solomon Guggenheim to 
Kandinsky and it was Miss Rebay who helped guide the formation 
of the collection which evolved into The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum. 

Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861-1949) was the fourth of seven 
remarkable Guggenheim brothers who created a financial empire 
in mining. Both he and his wife, Irene Rothschild, were interested 
in art. They, like so many American millionaires, had amassed a 
collection of Old Masters, rather minor masters, to be sure, as the 
Guggenheims had begun collecting later than their great contem- 
poraries, the Morgans, Wideners and Fricks. They decorated their 
homes with paintings by Bernardino Luini, Joos van Cleef, Bern- 
hard Strigel and Hans Maler zu Schwaz. They also bought fashion- 
able French Barbizon landscapes, prints by Whistler and Audubon, 
Chinese paintings on glass and Persian miniatures. Their taste was 
conventional, eclectic and without strong personal direction. 

In the late twenties circumstances radically changed the course 
of Mr. Guggenheim's collecting. In the fall of 19Z7 Irene Guggen- 
heim was introduced to a young German artist, Baroness Hilla Re- 
bay von Ehrenwiesen, who had recently arrived in New York. 1 By 
the end of the year their acquaintance had ripened into friendship, 
and Mrs. Guggenheim helped her young protegee obtain portrait 
commissions. In 1928 Solomon Guggenheim himself sat for his 
portrait. Then began the long association which ended only with 
his death. 

Hilla Rebay was the daughter of a German military officer who 
had early begun to study art. Talented, attractive and dynamic, she 
had exhibited with avant-garde groups in Germany, particularly the 
Secession in Munich (1913-15) and Berlin (1916). She also had 
entree into the Parisian art world through her friendship with Felix 
Feneon. In 1917 she was included in an exhibition at the gallery 
of Der Sturm in Berlin and in 1919 participated in a two-man 
show there. Her close friend Hans Arp had introduced her to 
Herwarth Walden, and probably through him she came to know 
the work of other artists who exhibited at Der Sturm: Delaunay, 



1. I am deeply indebted to Dr. Joan M. Lukach for this account of Miss Rebay's 
meeting with the Guggenheims and her early contacts with Kandinsky, Arp 
and Feneon. Dr. Lukach's book on Hilla Rebay and the Museum of Non- 
Objective Painting is in preparation. 



Chagall, Leger, Glcizes, Bauer and Kandinsky. Among the artists 
of the avant-garde, her major hero was Kandinsky. 

Vasily Kandinsky was one of the most important and influential 
painters in Germany in the decade before World War I. Born in 
Russia in 1866, he left a career in law at the age of thirty to study 
painting in Munich. He soon became a leader of modernist painters 
in Munich, founding the Phalanx group in 1901, the Nate Kiinstler- 
vereinigung Miinchen in 1909 and, with his friend Franz Marc, the 
Blaue Reiter in 191 1. The following year he published Concerning 
the Spiritual in Art, the first of his major writings on art, edited 
with Marc the Almanach der Blaue Reiter and was given his first 
one-man show at the gallery of Der Sturm in Berlin. During the 
years before the outbreak of hostilities in 1 9 14, he moved gradually 
away from representational painting to abstraction. 

In 1914 Kandinsky went to Russia and subsequently was active in 
the cultural affairs of the revolutionary government. By 192 1, how- 
ever, the Soviet government had become extremely hostile to mod- 
ern art. Kandinsky left Russia for Germany and in 1922 accepted 
a post at the newly established Bauhaus at Weimar. 

Kandinsky and Miss Rebay did not meet until 1929. Rebay 
could, however, have seen his work as early as 191 1 when she 
studied painting in Munich and later at Der Sturm after she moved 
to Berlin in 191 3. Certainly her own painting at this time was 
completely abstract, or what she termed "non-objective," reflecting 
the strong influence of both Kandinsky and Franz Marc. She pas- 
sionately embraced the cause of "non-objectivity," inspired in part 
by the spiritual emphasis of Kandinsky's writings and also by her 
intimacy with Rudolf Bauer, who himself painted in the style of 
Kandinsky. 

The Guggenheims were caught up in Rebay's enthusiasm for 
modern art and were persuaded that they should form an important 
collection. In the summer of 1929 Miss Rebay brought them to 
Kandinsky's studio at the Bauhaus. The visit was a success. They 
purchased Composition 8, 1923, a major oil, and went to Klee*s 
studio next door. On subsequent trips to Furope, Miss Rebay intro- 
duced them to other major avant-garde painters. The Guggenheims 
enjoyed meeting the artists and preferred buying directly from them: 
at many of these studio visits paintings were selected for the 
collection. 

During the thirties Mr. Guggenheim continued to buy, steadily 
and in increasing quantities. Inevitably the idea of establishing a 
museum took shape, and in 1937 The Solomon R. Guggenheim 



Foundation was incorporated "to encourage the development of 
the aesthetic sense of our people." 2 He endowed the Museum 
with three million dollars and the gift of one hundred and forty- 
five paintings. Among these were works by Chagall, Delaunay, 
Feininger, Gleizes, Leger and Klee, but the largest group by a 
single artist other than Bauer consisted of twenty-seven oils and 
six watercolors by Kandinsky. 

The relationship between Kandinsky and Miss Rebay, after the 
brief visit to Dessau in 1929, developed into a warm friendship. 
Kandinsky, Guggenheim and the Baroness wrote to one another 
from 1930 to 1938; many of their letters are on file in The Hilla 
von Rebay Foundation Archive. There are occasional rather formal 
letters from Kandinsky to Mr. Guggenheim, but correspondence 
from the artist to Rebay becomes increasingly personal. Kandin- 
sky worries about the arrival of his paintings in New York, 
describes his travels, discusses exhibitions. He bitterly describes the 
closing of the Bauhaus by the Nazis and the difficulties he faced 
establishing himself in the art world in Paris where he moved in 
1933. He chides her when she subjects him to a diatribe about 
some suspected slight. They quarrel over his prices. But she con- 
tinues to buy his work, even when she professes that Mr. Guggen- 
heim has no money. 

Rudolf Bauer not only sold Mr. Guggenheim quantities of his 
own paintings, but purchased a large number of Kandinskys for 
the Foundation. In 1939 alone, he acquired more than two dozen 
Kandinskys, none of them, as far as we know, obtained directly 
from the artist. 

Another important group came to the collection through the 
Swiss painter Otto Nebel. The Nazi government sold at a series of 
auctions in Switzerland a large quantity of what they designated 
Entartete Kt/nst (degenerate art), modern works confiscated from 
German museums and private collections. In June 1938, one of 
these auctions, the sale of the collection of Heinrich Stinnes, was 
held at Gutekunst und Klipstein in Bern. Miss Rebay commissioned 
Nebel to bid for the Foundation, and nine Kandinskys were pur- 
chased. The following year Mr. Guggenheim bought six more 
Kandinskys at Gutekunst und Klipstein, including the outstanding 
early oil Blue Mountain, 1908-9, which had formerly belonged to 
the Staatliche Gemaldegalerie in Dresden. 



By far the largest number of Kandinskys, however, came into the 
collection through the Nierendorf Gallery in New York. A German 
art dealer who fled Nazi Germany in 1936, Karl Nierendorf showed 
the work of exiled German Expressionists in his gallery on Fifty- 
Seventh Street. Beginning in 1937 Nierendorf became Kandinsky's 
dealer, giving him many one-man shows and frequently including 
his work in group exhibitions. Of the fifty watercolors in this ex- 
hibition, twenty-six were purchased directly from Nierendorf. 

It is unfortunate that there is little evidence of the circumstances 
surrounding the acquisition of so many works, despite the relation- 
ship which existed between Nierendorf and Miss Rebay. This re- 
lationship appears to date from 1937 and was cordial, perhaps even 
close/ In the archives of the Rebay Foundation there are letters 
from Nierendorf to the Baroness written in 1946-47 in which he de- 
scribes a six-month trip to Paris, Switzerland and Germany, and 
reports on visits to mutual friends, artists and exhibitions. He rec- 
ommends acquisitions for the Foundation and accepts 10,000 dol- 
lars for making purchases. 

When Nierendorf died intestate in October 1947, the Founda- 
tion acquired his entire estate. Although the largest group consisted 
of Klees, there were eleven Kandinsky oils and watercolors and 
more than one hundred of his prints. For reasons which are unclear, 
almost none of Nierendorf's records— his correspondence, receipts 
of purchase and sales— came to the Museum with the estate. We 
have only three small notebooks and a receipt book. Of these only 
one is of importance: a listing dated 1942 of works of art in stock, 
recorded by inventory number. It is possible to determine which 
Guggenheim and Rebay Kandinskys were in Nierendorf's possession 
by 1942 by matching the inventory numbers with labels or numbers 
on the backs of the works. There are ninety-seven Kandinskys re- 
corded in this inventory, excluding prints; of these, seventeen can 
be positively identified as works in the current exhibition. 

The second notebook is a day-by-day account book of expenses 
from April 1944 through December 1945. Written in miniscule, 
abbreviated script, often in shorthand, it is irritatingly difficult to 
decipher, but occasionally offers collaborative information. In the 
entry for January 5, 1945, f° r example, he notes "130/K/ w.c. mil 
GoLi v.R 9°/22j," surely in reference to the Untitled watercolor, ca. 
191 1 -1 2 (cat. no. 2), which we know the Baroness purchased from 



;.. Letter from Mr. Guggenheim to the Board of Trustees of the Foundation, 
June 12, 1937. 



3. When Nierendorf died without any close relatives in this country, Miss Rebay 
arranged to have him buried in her plot at Greens Farms, Connecticut. 



Nierendorf in January 1945. The notebook also reveals that two 
days later eight paintings by Kandinsky were sold to the Guggen- 
heim Foundation. On February 4, 1945, Nierendorf sold eight Kan- 
dinsky watercolors and two oils to Miss Rebay. We have the in- 
voice for this transaction in the Rebay archives. One of the last 
entries reads "2/xi r [r94$j Kandinsky w.c. [from] Jeanne Bncher 
(sold: Baroness)." This confirms the fact that the watercolor Sup- 
ports, 1939 (cat. no. 47), recorded in Kandinsky's Handlist as 
bought by the Parisian dealer Jeanne Bucher in 1944, was subse- 
quently sold by Bucher to Nierendorf, who then sold it to the 
Baroness. 1 

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection of Non-Objective Paint- 
ings opened in rented quarters on East Fifty-Fourth Street in 1939, 
two years after the Guggenheim Foundation had been incorporated 
and endowed with the first gift. Soon it was known as the Museum 
of Non-Objective Painting. Miss Rebay, who was appointed Di- 
rector, mounted exhibitions and continued to enlarge the institu- 
tion's holdings. Mr. Guggenheim made additional large gifts from 
his collection in 1940 and 1941. In the 1941 gift were twenty-one 
Kandinskys. At Solomon Guggenheim's death in 1949, the remain- 
ing paintings in his private collection, which included two more 
Kandinskys, came to the Foundation. This gift brought the total 
Kandinsky holdings of the Museum to more than one hundred and 
eighty. 

In 1952 Miss Rebay resigned from the Museum and withdrew 
her personal collection to her estate at Greens Farms, Connecticut. 
This same year, after James Johnson Sweeney became Director, the 
name of the institution was changed to The Solomon R. Guggen- 
heim Museum. The Museum's exclusive preoccupation with non- 
objective painting was replaced by a concern with the whole spec- 
trum of twentieth-century art. The Frank Lloyd Wright building, 
which Mr. Guggenheim and Miss Rebay had commissioned in 1943, 
was finally completed and opened in 1959. When the present Di- 
rector, Thomas M. Messer, was appointed in 1961, he began to 
reassess the collection. The number of Kandinsky's works was 
judged to be disproportionate to the Museum's other holdings. 
Thus, in 1964 the Trustees of the Foundation ordered an auction of 
fifty oils by the artist. Beginning in 1970 a large number of dupli- 
cate impressions of Kandinsky prints from the Nierendorf Estate

states that the watercolor was brought by Jeanne Bucher to New York in 
1945- 



were sold. Several other Kandinsky graphics, a medium crucial to 
the understanding of the artist's early development, were bought. 
Five rare color woodcuts dating from 1903 to 1907 as well as four 
color lithographs and etchings from the Bauhaus and Paris years 
were purchased to fill gaps in the collection. The Museum hopes to 
make further acquisitions in the area of graphics. 

The most recent major group of Kandinskys entered the collec- 
tion after the death of Hilla Rebay in 196-. The Baroness, a woman 
of strong will and dedication to principles, could never forgive the 
Foundation for deviating from the dogma of non-objectivity. In her 
will she established The Hilla von Rebay Foundation to "foster, 
promote and encourage the interest of the public in non-objective 
art," and bequeathed to her Foundation her collection of over four 
hundred and fifty works. In 1971 the Guggenheim Foundation 
reached a settlement with the Rebay Estate by which the Museum 
acquired two hundred and forty-eight paintings, sculptures and 
works on paper. By far the most important among them were thirty- 
two Kandinsky oils, watercolors and prints. This acquisition led to 
a new assessment and a further reduction of the Museum's Kan- 
dinsky holdings. In 197] forty-six oils and watercolors were sold 
at auction. The Kandinsky collection at the Museum now numbers 
one hundred and forty paintings and works on paper. 

Since the settlement with the Rebay Estate relations between the 
Guggenheim Foundation and The Hilla von Rebay Foundation 
have been close and harmonious. In i9 _ 4 an agreement was reached 
to deposit the Rebay collection with the Museum for an indefinite 
period. The Rebay library was brought to the Museum library the 
following year, and a Rebay archive was established at the Museum. 

In the spring of 19- — the Museum collaborated with the Rebay 
Foundation on a project which led to the present exhibition. Sets of 
color slides of twenty-five Kandinsky watercolors from the Rebay 
Foundation were distributed to museums and galleries in this coun- 
try and abroad, together with the announcement that the works 
would be available for loan. The response was immediate and many 
institutions requested a loan exhibition of Kandinsky watercolors. 
With the consent of the Trustees of the Rebay and Guggenheim 
Foundations, this selection of fifty watercolors drawn from both 
collections will now be shown in nine states across the length and 
breadth of the country. 



KANDINSKY WATERCOLORS 



by Vivian Endicott Barnett 



Kandinsky painted with oil on canvas or cardboard or wood, with 
tempera on colored paper, gouache and oil on board, oil and sand 
on canvas and oil on glass. And throughout his career he painted 
watercolors: crisp, bold brushstrokes of translucent color over 
pencil or ink, or flowing wet washes, or fine particles of sprayed 
pigment obscuring the paper. Kandinsky's watercolors reveal an 
extraordinary technical expertise. He often exploited the abstract 
qualities unique to the medium. Errors and reworkings are absent 
from his watercolors. Except in a few early and late examples, 
Kandinsky employed high quality paper for his watercolors. Surely 
he was cognizant of works in the medium by Eugene Delacroix, 
Paul Cezanne, the Nabis, J.M.W. Turner and English watercolor- 
ists. Moreover, during the first fourteen years of this century, fel- 
low Munich artists such as Franz Marc, August Macke, Gabriele 
Miinter and Paul Klee also worked in watercolor. 

Kandinsky's watercolors incorporate the precision of line char- 
acteristic of his early graphic work with the complexity of forms 
found in his oil paintings. Although Will Grohmann, Erika Hanf- 
staengl, Hans Konrad Roethel and Angelica Rudenstine have con- 
tributed significantly to our knowledge of specific watercolors, 
the literature on Kandinsky lacks adequate information on the 
artist's techniques and careful analysis of the relationship between 
watercolors and oils. This essay will examine Kandinsky's water- 
colors from different periods in relation to one another and in re- 
lation to his contemporary oil paintings. Questions concerning 
the mutuality and interdependence of watercolors and oils will be 
investigated. Since Kandinsky systematically recorded the oils he 
painted in his Hanskataloge (or Handlists) and since he also cata- 
logued his watercolors after 1922, the correlation between oils and 
watercolors can be studied closely. Such analysis brings to light 
changes in their relationship which are usually corroborated by 
the visual evidence. The structure of this essay is determined pri- 
marily by the fifty watercolors from The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum and The Hilla von Rebay Foundation which comprise the 
present exhibition. Discussion of the artist's techniques, which 
focuses upon the same fifty examples, has benefited from the 
knowledge of Marjorie B. Cohn, Conservator of Works on Paper 
at The Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, as well as from 
the advice of the Guggenheim Museum's Conservation Department. 
While this text does not presume to be definitive, it presents new 
information and perspectives and raises questions requiring further 
study with regard to other Kandinsky watercolors. 



Kandinsky's watercolors date from 1900 to 1944, virtually his 
entire artistic career. The earliest extant body of work in this me- 
dium belongs to the Stadtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus in Munich. 
However, Kandinsky painted watercolors long before he went to 
Munich to study art in 1896. The artist remembered that as a child, 
under the guidance of his aunt, Elizaveta Tikheeva, he once painted 
a horse in watercolor which was complete except for the hoofs. "I 
thought if I made the hoofs very black they would certainly be 
completely true to nature. I put as much black on the brush as 
I could. One instant— and I saw four black, disgusting, ugly spots, 
utterly foreign to the paper, on the horse's feet." ("Reminiscences," 
in Modern Artists on Art, trans. E. W. Herbert, p. 28) 

During the first decade of this century when Kandinsky lived 
principally in Munich and traveled frequently, figure studies, land- 
scapes, knights, riders and Russian scenes dominated his water- 
colors and temperas. His prints parallel and often anticipate stylisti- 
cally his accomplishments in other works on paper. Kandinsky's 
distinctive group of paintings in tempera on dark paper (which he 
called "farbige Zeichnungen" or colored drawings) date from 1901 
to 1908 and are clearly related to the contemporary black and white 
woodcuts. Against a dark ground he placed well-defined areas of 
color and applied white highlights. The dark support functions 
both negatively as a field and positively as the shadowed parts of 
forms, or sometimes as a distinct entity. The compositional and spa- 
tial possibilities inherent in this technique are explored in Tunisian 
Sheep Festival of 1905 (Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum). In The Night of 190- (fig. 1) dots of pigment and blobs 
of color as well as black and dark green areas have been applied to 
the dark gray support. The same pastel colors that indicate stars in 
the sky also define flowers in the foreground and the woman's long 
dress. The bodies of the lovely young woman combing her hair and 
the beckoning witch (presumably Babba Yaga) seem dematerial- 
ized; their clothing can be read as dots of color. The forms exist as 
decorative surface patterns and, for the most part, the figure-ground 
relationship is obliterated. The dabs of paint are applied quite 
sparsely in The Night: in particular, the middle zone between the 
two figures consists of colored shapes which are already remark- 
ably abstract. 

The earliest Kandinsky watercolors in the Guggenheim Museum 
Collection date from about 19 11. In the Untitled watercolor with 
bronze powder paint (cat. no. 2), the colored areas appear as ab- 
stract forms. The dark border painted with India ink frames the

central oval and contrasts with the bronze. Jugendstil artists fre- 
quently employed gold and bronze accents: for example, Carl 
Strathmann juxtaposed watercolor, India ink and gold in several 
works from about 1900. In the Guggenheim's print The Golden Sail 
of 1903, Kandinsky printed gold ink on a color woodcut. It is pos- 
sible to identify oars, a boat and waves at the right side of our 
watercolor, especially when it is compared with a similar work on 
paper, The Boat, or even the canvas Improvisation 26 (Oars) both 
of 1912 (Collection Stadtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich, 
GMS 615 and 65 respectively). 

In another Untitled watercolor from about 191 1 (cat. no. 1), 
traces of oars and a boat are visible near the bottom edge and 
the enclosing perimeter of a hortns conclusus together with a re- 
clining pair of lovers can be discerned above. These are recurrent 
motifs in Kandinsky's work around 19 12 which emerge promi- 
nently in his oil paintings Improvisations zj, 26 and 27. While it is 
obvious that this watercolor has faded, the extent to which the 
colored areas have vanished becomes apparent only when the origi- 
nal is compared with a reproduction from the catalogue of the 
second Blane Reiter exhibition of February-April 1912. In its pres- 
ent state, the contour lines are accentuated and scant hints of color 
remain. The red dots are mere clues to the perhaps carmine areas 
of wash that once were there. It is possible to reconstruct a red 
sunburst in the center and a substantial amount of yellow at the 
upper right. Recently, when this watercolor was examined under 
raking light, clearly defined areas where binder coated the paper 
were visible. The patterns of residue coincide with the distinct areas 
of watercolor in the early reproduction, especially in the entire 
upper left and right corners and in details at the center. Stylisti- 
cally, this watercolor is related to others Kandinsky exhibited in 
1912 with the Blaue Reiter (GMS 130, 147, 148: see Hanfstaengl, 
pp. 80-81, and Gollek, pp. 277, 299). 



Most of Kandinsky's watcrcolors from 1910 to 1914 can be 
related to coeval oil paintings and some are direct preparatory 
sketches for canvases. A watercolor (not in this exhibition) in The 
Hilla von Rebay Foundation collection bears a strikingly close re- 
semblance to the large oil, No. 160b of 1912, which was acquired 
by Solomon R. Guggenheim in 1936. The watercolor displays a 
greater profusion and clarity of details— such as the mountain and 
cannon at the upper left and the citadel at the upper right. For 
another painting from 19 12, Improvisation 27 {Garden of Love) 
(Collection The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), there- 
is an earlier watercolor study in the Stadtsiche Galerie im Lenbach- 
haus, Munich (GMS 148). Kandinsky made watercolor studies for 
several of the canvases from 1913 in the Guggenheim Museum Col- 
lection: Painting with White Form, Pai7iting with White Border, 
Small Pleasures and Light Picture. 

Study for "Improvisation 33" (cat. no. 3) is one of three water- 
color studies for the canvas Improvisation 33 (Sketch for Orient) 
from 19 1 3 in the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. The same overall 
composition, color scheme and motifs are common to all four: 
specifically, diagonal bands of color at the upper left, the adjacent 
spear-like shape, the blue arch and red circle farther to the right in 
the background, a female form reclining across the foreground and, 
below this figure, blue, yellow and rose dabs of paint. Within the 
group, the Rebay watercolor (cat. no. 3) bears a greater resemblance 
to the work identified by Hanfstaengl as Aquarell 1 zu Thema 
"Orient" (no. 223, color pi. XIV, GMS 359) than to Aquarell 2 zu 
Thema "Orient" (Hanfstaengl no. 224, GMS 138) or to the final 
canvas. Since the images are more precise and legible in Aquarell t 
(Collection Stadtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus. Munich), they can 
be used as points of reference in deciphering the Rebay watercolor. 
Both works are similar in size and paper supports; neither is close, 
in these respects, to Aquarell 2. The female figure in the Rebay 
watercolor lacks the rounded breasts and clearly defined shape of 
the nude in the oil painting. 

Study for "Improvisation ]i" gives the impression of being ex- 
traordinarily free, abstract and expressionistic. Without knowing 
the related works, it would be difficult to interpret the images. In the 
Rebay watercolor Kandinsky first sketched in the main composi- 
tional elements with pencil and India ink and then defined the forms 
with brilliant red, blue, green and yellow areas of color. At the 
upper right and in central portions, he painted overlapping layers 
of translucent color. In the pink and red areas of wash in the middle

and the gray and ran washes at the lower left, diluted pigment has 
been applied to wet paper so that it becomes increasingly fluid and 
transparent and the support remains visible. The bare white paper 
near the bottom serves both as the background and as the female 
form. Thus, by nature of its medium, the watercolor differs sig- 
nificantly from the final oil painting Improvisation 33 (Sketch for 
Orient). 

In his essay "Das Bild mit weissem Rand" or "Painting with 
White Border," which was published with "Riickblicke" ("Reminis- 
cences") in 1913, Kandinsky related how he made many studies, 
sketches and drawings for the oil painting of that title (fig. 2). Rang- 
ing in date from December 1912 to May 1913, the preparatory 
studies provide insights into the artist's working methods. Kan- 
dinsky acknowledged the unusual difficulties he experienced in 
resolving the composition. He abandoned the vertical format of 
preliminary watercolors and an oil in favor of the horizontal one 
encountered in the Study for "Painting with White Border" in 
the collection of The Hilla von Rebay Foundation (cat. no. 4) 
and in the final canvas. As the painting evolved, Kandinsky for- 
mulated several expressive pencil sketches as well as schematic 
drawings in which only essential lines and directional arrows are 
indicated. The right side of the Rebay watercolor differs markedly 
from the Guggenheim painting. The lance, which is red rather than 
white in the work on paper, occupies a more prominent, diagonal 



position and extends well across the small page. At the right edge 
of the watercolor there are fish shapes and vague linear patterns: 
these are omitted entirely from the painting and replaced by the 
white border which firmly defines the perimeter of the canvas. Over 
a faint pencil underdrawing Kandinsky delineated the forms with 
India ink. The colors are vivid and clear, and stand out against the 
plain paper support. 

Several months after completing Painting with White Border 
Kandinsky painted Light Picture (fig. 3) which is nearly identi- 
cal to but three times larger than the watercolor study (Collec- 
tion Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Niirnberg, HZ 352.9 Kapsel 
1548a; 10 x 13%", 2.5.4 x 34.5 cm.). Compositional structure, linear 
configurations, color areas and most peculiarities of detail corre- 
spond in the canvas and watercolor. In each, a dark red spot is 
located at the center below a lavender diagonal; farther to the left, 
yellow surrounds bold zigzag lines, and at the lower left and lower 
right there is green-blue. The oil pigments have been applied thinly 
and blended delicately into the white and yellow paint of the back- 
ground. In the Guggenheim picture the scratchy black lines have not 
been made with India ink and a pen: rather, they are translations of 
ink into oil paint. The blotted and smeared "ink" at the lower left 
is actually oil on canvas. The stippled effect associated with a pen 
point or etching needle has been meticulously painted with a fine 
brush. In the watercolor, ink lines as well as blots and washes of

color were applied to the white paper over a thinly-washed ground 
tone. Even without prior knowledge of the Niirnberg study, one 
realizes that Light Picture captures the feeling of a watercolor. 
Comparison of the oil painting and watercolor leads one to con- 
sider the hypothesis that Kandinsky wished to approximate in oil 
the multiplicity of ink lines, the brilliant, translucent colors and 
pale, luminous ground of the watercolor. 

Light Picture and Black Lines, both completed in December 19 13 
and now in the collection of the Guggenheim Museum, were singled 
out by the artist as non-objective pictures: not abstractions from 
objects but essentially and totally abstract works. Both paintings 
resemble watercolors in ways indicative of the abstract tendencies 
of that medium: the touches of paint, the puddling of colored water 
that is absorbed into the paper, its translucence and clarity, the 
exploitation of the paper support and the resultant closeness of 
figure and ground that it is possible to achieve with thin wash over 
white paper. In Light Picture and Black Lines Kandinsky painted a 
yellow-white ground with oils, he accentuated the jagged, blurred 
and stippled patterns of black lines and allowed amorphous, float- 
ing areas of effulgent color to dominate the canvas. 

While there are no watercolors identical to Black Lines, two pre- 
paratory drawings belong to the Stadtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus 
in Munich (GMS 394 and 428). The latter (fig. 4) contains abbrevi- 
ated color notes which correspond for the most part with the hues 



in the painting. Kandinsky began to annotate colors in this manner 
at least as early as 1905, when he indicated colors in sketchbooks 
which he took along on trips. Color notes appear frequently in 
schematic drawings, occasionally in watercolors and in a rare in- 
stance in an oil painting, Sketch for "Composition II" from 1909-10 
(Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), where they 
are visible with the naked eye. Such shorthand notes seem to be an 
integral part of Kandinsky's working method from the first years 
of the century through 1914. 



In August 1914 Kandinsky left Munich and went first to Switzer- 
land and then to Russia. World War I forced him to leave Germany, 
where he had lived for most of the time between 1896 and 1914, 
and resulted in his separation from Gabriele Miinter, his com- 
panion for over a decade. He did not execute any oils in 191 5 and 
he painted only a limited number of canvases for the next six years. 
Kandinsky did, however, continue to produce watercolors, draw- 
ings, etchings and paintings on glass between 1915 and 1919. From 
Christmas 1915 until mid-March 1916 he was in Stockholm to see 
Miinter and to prepare for an exhibition of his work which opened 
in February at Carl Gummeson's gallery. A curious group of about 
fourteen watercolors (for example, Picnic, cat. no. 5), which he 
called "bagatelles" or "trifles," dates from this time. Related to

coeval drypoints and slightly later glass paintings, they are fanciful, 
amusing, representational and reminiscent of his early Biedermeier 
drawings and certain paintings from 1909. Picnic shares with a 
small pencil sketch dated January 12, 1916 (Stadtische Galerie im 
Lenbachhaus, Munich, GMS 509) such motifs as the lady with lorg- 
nette, twisting forms of tree branches, city towers and the triangu- 
lar area of the picnic scene. As Hans Konrad Roethel has observed, 
Kandinsky's sketch in the Handlist proves that he intended the 
work to be seen as a square, rather than as a lozenge. The water- 
color which is filled with details— a swan, fish, apples, wine glass 
and carafe— was precisely painted with a brush over ink. 

Kandinsky has abandoned the retrogressive style of the 1916 
watercolor in two examples dated 1918 (cat. nos. 6 and 7). In the 
former, which is predominantly pale blue and yellow, the oval orbit 
frees the composition from traditional constraints and permits the 
citadel to be suspended in air. The abstract forms contain vestiges 
of mountains, cities, ships, masses of people and even explosions. 
Many of the minute, seemingly free spatters of ink around the 
perimeter did not occur accidentally or spontaneously but were 
carefully drawn by the artist. In the other work from 1918 in this 
exhibition (cat. no. 7), Kandinsky first put down all the ink lines, 
then added the red-orange, green, yellow and blue accents with 
watercolor and painted in the highlights with opaque white. The 
watercolor so accurately replicates an ink drawing of virtually iden- 



tical size (io'/s x 13V2", 2.5.6 x 34.3 cm.) dated 1918 in the Tretiakov 
Gallery in Moscow that it must be a copy (reproduced in Grohmann, 
1958, p. 167, and Volboudt, pi. 39). Since the support of the Gug- 
genheim watercolor is tracing paper which Kandinsky mounted on 
cardboard, he undoubtedly traced the lines in the watercolor from 
the drawing. Kandinsky wrote in Russian on the reverse of the 
cardboard mount: "Sketch for Composition N° 8." At first this in- 
scription appears puzzling, since the watercolor antedates by five 
years Composition 8 (fig. 5) and does not resemble the final version. 
However, in the Handlist of oil paintings under the year 1920, 
Kandinsky recorded Composition 8 (Sketch) as number 228; he 
later named the painting Spitzes Schweben or Pointed Suspension 
(U.S.S.R.; present location unknown). This canvas was included 
in an exhibition of Russian art at the Galerie van Diemen in Berlin 
in 1922 and was reproduced in the catalogue as Kompositio&gt;i. Pho- 
tographs reveal that it shares several motifs with the drawing and 
watercolor. One can conclude that Kandinsky painted both our 
1918 watercolor and the 1920 oil while formulating a Composition 
which was never realized in its final state. 



Late in 1921 Kandinsky left Russia for Berlin and by the middle 
of 1922 he was living in Weimar and teaching at the Bauhaus. A 
watercolor dated 1922 from the Guggenheim Museum Collection 



12 



(cat. no. 9) belongs to a transitional moment in Kandinsky's devel- 
opment. The forms are geometric and do not allude to recognizable 
objects: they are quite similar to those in the painting Variegated 
Circle (Banter Kreis) from 192.1. The watercolor retains the oval 
structural organization and, at the corners, traces of the border 
prevalent in so many earlier works (cat. nos. 2, 6-8). Although most 
of the circles are painted freehand, three have been drawn with a 
compass. In a 1922 watercolor from The Hilla von Rebay Founda- 
tion (cat. no. 10), the geometric structure not only determines the 
major motifs but also the composition: the large translucent tri- 
angle and the diagonal wedge-shape superimposed over a rhom- 
boid. Kandinsky drew all but one of the circles with a compass. The 
largest one, whose circumference is emphasized by five concentric 
bands, brings to mind the circle in a 1924 watercolor, Unstable (cat. 
no. 17). By 1923 circles figured prominently in Kandinsky's work. 
With his association with the Bauhaus, Kandinsky's manner of 
organizing pictorial elements changed. In Free Relationship (Freie 
Beziebung, cat. no. 12) much of the paper support remains bare and 
geometric shapes are strewn about the page. Moreover, there is a 
new rigidity in the ink lines and precision in the grid and checker- 
board patterns that testify to reliance upon ruler and compass. A 
purity and spareness of elements becomes characteristic of many 
Bauhaus works. 

In 1922 Kandinsky began to catalogue his watercolors in a Hand- 
list. He recorded seventeen watercolors during that year, sixty-five 
the following year, seventy-six in 1924, twenty-two in 1925 but only 
three in 1926. For the first year or two he did not always specify 
titles for the watercolors, nor did he list all the works produced 
in 1922 (for example, cat. no. 9). By 1924 each entry provides a 
title, date, dimensions, a small sketch of the work as well as a record 
of its whereabouts. The Handlists are numbered consecutively and, 
in most cases, roman numerals indicate the month or months in 
which a work was executed. From the artist's catalogues we know 
that Free Relationship dates from July 1923, as does Composi- 
tion 8, an untitled study for it, and the painting Circles in a Circle. 
Comparison of the painting catalogue and the watercolor catalogue 
for the year 1923 proves enlightening. There are at least ten water- 
colors that are remarkably closely related to oils: for example, an 
untitled watercolor from 1922 (HL 32) is strikingly similar in com- 
position and color areas to Accentuated Corners, the first 1923 oil 
listed (Betonte Ecken, HL 247). Kandinsky catalogued as Study for 
"On White" [Entwurf zu Auf Weiss) a 1923 watercolor (HL 42) 



that is virtually identical with the oil On White which was painted 
in February to April that year (HL 253). And he listed a watercolor 
(HL 65) done in March as Entwurf zu Bild No 255 or Study for 
"Throughgoing Fine" (Durchgehender Strich, HL 255), which was 
also painted in the same month. By and large, the watercolors follow 
the same sequence as the oils with the exception of Circles in a Cir- 
cle [Kreise im Kreis, HL 261), which was painted in July although 
the watercolor Study for "Circles in a Circle" (HL 52) dates from 
the first quarter of the year. Composition 8 (HL 260; fig. 5) and the 
untitled watercolor for the right half of the painting (HL 81) were 
both executed in July 1923. However, the Guggenheim's canvas In 
the Black Square [Im schwarzem Viereck, HL 259) dates from June, 
although Kandinsky places the corresponding untitled watercolor 
(HL 84) in July. Thus, the question arises whether the watercolor 
was done after the oil or if there was an error in recording the 
month. Close analysis of the two Handlists reveals that the oil Ani- 
mated Repose (Bewegte Ruhe, HL 262), was painted in October 
but the watercolor (HL 105) belongs with works from the follow- 
ing month. However, in all other cases, watercolors precede cor- 
responding oil paintings. Among the works studied, watercolors 
and oils are extraordinarily close in overall composition, details and 
specific color areas for Accentuated Corners, On White, In the Black 
Square, Circles in a Circle and Black Accompaniment. The degrees 
of elaboration and explicitness found in the 1923 studies separate 
them from the majority of sketches Kandinsky executed between 
1910 and 1914. Moreover, in 1923 there is a single extremely de- 
tailed watercolor for each oil rather than the many preliminary 
studies he customarily executed during the Munich years. 

Through 1923 the artist's titles and annotations in the watercolor 
Handlist refer to studies for paintings. But from 1924 until 1934 
Kandinsky never wrote "Entwurf zu" or "Projet pour" in the water- 
color catalogue. Instead, he assigned each watercolor its individual 
title. They assume a more important role in his oeuvre and are not 
regarded as preliminary or supplementary to paintings but as inde- 
pendent works of art. During this period, when he was at the Bau- 
haus, Kandinsky produced many more watercolors than in previ- 
ous years and he dramatically expanded their technical range and 
complexity. 

There are six watercolors from 1924 included in this exhibition. 
Bright Lucidity (Helle Klarheit, cat. no. 13) which was painted in 
May, displays flat, bright red, blue, yellow, green and purple shapes 
silhouetted against a white background. Similarly clear-cut angular 



13 



forms occur in contemporary works such as Joyous Structure (Frdh- 
lich Aufbau, HL 148) and Sharp-Calm Pink (Das scharfruhige Rosa, 
HL 273). By contrast, in On Violet (Auf Violett, cat. no. 14) 
Kandinsky first washed the entire sheet with purple and sponged 
the paper so that the slight uneveness of the violet ground preserves 
the texture of the support. The images are dispersed over the violet 
ground, thus emphasizing the constituent shapes. The substantial 
pyramidal form is dark green at the top and cadmium orange be- 
low; the bridge and adjacent areas are comprised of multicolored 
pointillist dots. In Gray (Gran, cat. no. 15) the large central shape 
has a mottled, coagulated surface texture achieved by adding a 
substance such as soap or alcohol to the medium. The composition 
and dark, subdued colors of this work, which was painted in 
October, persist in Daybreak (Morgengrauen, cat. no. 16) from 
November 1924 and in Stable Forms (Stabiles, cat. no. 20), from 
December 1925. Daybreak and Unstable (Haltlos, cat. no. 17) are 
two of eleven watercolors Kandinsky executed in November. The 
animated interplay of circles, semicircles, rectangles and rhomboids 
in Daybreak stands in sharp contrast to the highly simplified circles 
and straight lines of Unstable. For the latter Kandinsky selected an 
unusual support where the texture was pressed onto the paper. Here 
red pigment bled upward from the bottom edge. By wetting the 
paper, he created nebulous blue circles in the middle and faintly 
tinted blue and yellow washes. The large yellow-orange circle 
whose circumference is repeated by four black lines has a blurred 
yellow corona. Two small circles are divided into variously colored 
quarters: an early instance of a favorite motif. 

In Brown Double Sound (Brauner Doppelklang, cat. no. 18), 
which is dated November-December 1924, Kandinsky experiments 
with combining triangles, circles and squares. The triangle super- 
imposed on a circle occurs also in a contemporary oil (Ruhiges, HL 
283). Brown Double Sound is apparently the first instance of the 
arrow in Kandinsky's work. The arrow, already a familiar and 
meaningful motif in the work of Paul Klee, recurs in similar form 
in a watercolor from December (Behauptung, HL 178) and several 
oils from March 1925 (HL 292, 293, 294). The genesis of the arrow 
from a square and a triangle is clear in the top center arrow in 
Brown Double Sound, which consists of a brown square and yel- 
low triangle, as it is in Kandinsky's sketch of the work in the Hand- 
list. In the watercolor Kandinsky seems to have erased the pencil 
underdrawing and to have laid down light brown lines with a brush. 



The color is pale, dull, thinly painted brown with the exception 
of the lavender rectangle, which appears to be a painting within a 
painting. The composition and the use of a framing device recall 
Brigbt Lucidity (cat. no. 13), although the colors of the two works 
differ radically. 

The title Brown Double Sound incorporates a term (doppel- 
klang) from Kandinsky's theoretical writings, specifically Point and 
Line to Plane which was published in 1926. Likewise, the title of a 
1925 watercolor, Inner Simmering (cat. no. 19) refers to "das in- 
nere Kocben," a concept Kandinsky wrote about in his essay, "Paint- 
ing with White Border," published in 1913. Before discussing Inner 
Simmering, which dates from November 1925, it should be men- 
tioned that Kandinsky had moved to Dessau in June with the trans- 
ferral of the Bauhaus from Weimar to Dessau. Correspondingly, 
the Handlist does not record any watercolors from April until 
November 1925 nor any oils from July through the end of the year. 
Kandinsky's monumental canvas Yellow-Red-Blue (Gelb-Rot-Blau, 
HL 314), is dated March-May 1925 and was preceded by a draw- 
ing and a watercolor (Grohmann, 1958, pp. 198, 409, cc 719, repr.). 
Inexplicably, the existing watercolor was not catalogued in the 
Handlist. 

A resplendent red wash fills the center of Inner Simmering and 
imparts the sense of free, rapid application of paint. However, 
Kandinsky first used a compass and ruler to draw all the forms 
in India ink. He then established the background tones before 
painting the principal forms. By sponging off the excess, he con- 
trolled the density and fluidity of the wash and kept it from obscur- 
ing the colors in the overlapping circles. The horn forms, common 
motifs around 1925-27, are found also in Hard in Slack (cat. no. 
23). Like Inner Simmering, Rising Warmth (Aufsteigende Wiirme, 
cat. no. 21) has an area of glowing red wash which provides a cen- 
tral focus and contrasts here with dark blue, purple and brown tri- 
angles. Rising Warmth recalls a watercolor Kandinsky executed in 
1925 (Nach oben, HL 20~) and also brings to mind watercolors by 
his friends and Bauhaus colleagues Lyonel Feininger and Paul Klee. 

By the autumn of 1927 Kandinsky's virtuoso techniques and his 
diversity of styles in the watercolors are astonishing. Hard in Slack 
(Hart im Locker) contrasts precise zones of intensely bright hues 
with surrounding blotches of brown wash. In the exactly contem- 
porary Hard but Soft (Hart, aber weich, cat. no. 22) Kandinsky 
applied colored washes over finely spattered ink. Used in conjunc- 



14 



tion with wash, the spatter technique expanded the range of light 
and shadow and enhanced the density and texture of the medium. 
By 192S spattered or sprayed watercolor appears frequently in 
Kandinsky's work (cat. nos. Z4-28), and it becomes increasingly 
prevalent in subsequent years. Although he painted fewer oils in 
1928, his production of watercolors was prolific and reached a 
total of ninety-one. Within the month of May Kandinsky completed 
twenty-one watercolors. One of them, To a Point (Zn einem Punkt, 
HL 263) is obviously a study for the 1928 oil On Points (Auf Spit- 
zen, HL 433), although the Handlist entry gives no indication that 
the watercolor is related to the oil and their German titles are quite 
different. Moreover, in the oil, the brushwork— the way pale yellows 
and lavenders are blended into the white background— suggests a 
conscious re-creation of the effect of watercolor. 

Into the Dark {Ins Dunkel, cat. no. 24), also from May 1928, was 
done entirely by spraying watercolor with an atomizer or a blow 
pipe. Kandinsky used both the positive and negative shapes of a 
stencil to create the background forms and the three sets of ascend- 
ing triangles. As he changed and removed the stencil shapes, Kan- 
dinsky repeated spray applications of diluted watercolor. The 
sequence of triangles in Into the Dark anticipates later watercolors 
such as Almost Submerged from March 1930 (Fast Versnnken, HL 
383) and De Profitndis from August 1932 (Aus der Tiefe, HL 
490). While Into the Dark contains no drawn lines, Kandinsky 
chose in other sprayed watercolors to emphasize linear elements: 
for example, Two Complexes and Vertical Accent which date from 
the autumn of 1928 (cat. nos. 25 and 26). In the former he covered 
the paper with yellow wash and sprayed rose and brownish-black 
watercolor around the perimeter. He established a subtle counter- 
point between the spattered rose and red circles at the left and the 
washed rose and red semi-circles at the right. In Aglow of Novem- 
ber 1928 (Aufgliihen, cat. no. 27) the artist combines wash, spatter 
and India ink to hold together otherwise disparate compositional 
elements. 

The spray process was employed by Klee and others at the Bau- 
haus, especially after 1925. Kandinsky and Klee had known each 
other since 191 1 in Munich. From 1926 to 1932 they shared a 
double house in Dessau. Undoubtedly, Klee's innovative use of the 
spray technique stimulated Kandinsky's work with the process. 
Moreover, Klee's stylistic influence can be perceived in several 
watercolors in this exhibition and others in the Guggenheim Mu- 



seum Collection: Little Came of 1928 (Kleines Spiel, HL 2K2 , 
Evasive of 1929 (cat. no. 30), an Untitled watercolor from 1930 
(cat. no. 33) and Now Upwards! from 193 1 (cat. no. 36). 

In the late 1920s Kandinsky's titles acquire their own distinctive 
vocabulary and often exemplify concepts developed in his theo- 
retical writings. In addition to the 1927 watercolor Hart, aber weich 
(cat. no. 22), there are coeval oils, Hart im Weich and Welches 
Hart as well as a 1930 watercolor, Hartweich. Red is featured in 
many titles in 1928 and is, as here, descriptive of the vivid colora- 
tion of the works: not only Im schweren Rot (In the Heavy Red, 
cat. no. 28) and Zwei Seiten Rot from December but also an earlier 
oil Schweres Rot. Likewise, Kandinsky's pictorial vocabulary re- 
mains self-contained and assumes structure and meaning through 
cross-references within his oeuvre: for example, the images in In the 
Heavy Red occur earlier in a 1926 oil (Verbindencs Criin, HL 332) 
and a watercolor from June 1928 (Rosa, HL 280). 

Both Unshakeable (Wackelfest, cat. no. 31) and Horizontal Blue 
(Wagerecht-Blatt, cat. no. 32) date from December 1929. In the 
latter the paper was washed with pale green watercolor, then 
sprayed with successive layers of green, two shades of blue, and 
rose. The horizontal element, red square and blue-green rectangle 
were added last. Fine particles of sprayed watercolor cover the en- 
tire sheet. In Unshakeable dark gray paper has been painted all over 
with brownish-rust color gouache. Red, orange, yellow, blue and 
green linear patterns— similar to those in Kandinsky's drawings- 
articulate the flat surface. The painted background in Unshakeable 
has depth and luminosity of tone but lacks the translucent atmo- 
spheric color of Horizontal Blue. In a little Untitled watercolor 
from 1930 (cat. no. 33), the effect of watercolor bleeding on wet 
paper belies the manner in which it was actually painted: on dry- 
paper which had been washed with pink, Kandinsky put an orange 
moon and purple structure with curved blue banners. The feathery, 
blurred edges of "bleeding watercolor" were simulated just as the 
"brown support" was fabricated in Unshakeable. 

The delicacy and precision of style in Now Upwards! from June 
193 1 (Jetzt Aaf!, cat. no. 36) is consistent with Kandinsky's tech- 
nique. Every line and brushstroke is perceptible although any trace 
of pencil has apparently been erased. Contrary to his usual practice 
at this time, Kandinsky made two preparatory drawings for Now 
Upwards! (Volboudt, pis. 68, 69). A thin green wash colors the 
support; alternating bands of yellow and pink form a horizontal 



15 



screen; lavender and green-blue complete the pale color-harmony. 
Now Upwards! is completely different in style, coloration and tech- 
nique from another watercolor, Reaching Upwards {Hinragend, 
cat. no. 35), executed during the same month. In the latter Kandin- 
sky mixed oil paint with watercolor. He followed his customary 
method of first drawing in India ink, next applying monochromatic 
washes, then bright hues of watercolor but he added oil pigment in 
most of the circular areas. For example, at the top, the yellow circle 
as well as its surrounding yellow halo was painted in oil, as were 
the heavily scrubbed, orange, purple and blue circles below. Stylis- 
tically and chronologically Hot {Heiss, cat. no. 37) stands in close 
proximity to Reaching Upwards 1 . In Hot intense shades of blue, 
purple and red confined to geometric zones in the center are juxta- 
posed with dense black ink wash around the margins. At the left 
India ink has bled into the wet paper to create plume-like, billow- 
ing black forms. The rippling and flowing patterns and variations 
in the intensity of black wash in these and earlier watercolors are 
approximated in the black background of Kandinsky's oil painting 
Several Circles from 1926 (Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum). 

The multiplicity of Kandinsky's watercolor techniques around 
193 1 is suggested in this exhibition by the three works discussed 
above, by the monochromatic sprayed watercolor Taut Line (cat. 
no. 38) and by the soft, rosy spatter and wash tones of Three Ar- 
rows (cat. no. 39). Spot Sounds {Flecken Klange, cat. no. 40) is an 
unusual instance of Kandinsky's experimentation with the mono- 
type technique. Evidently, the blue pigment at the very top and in 
the smudged areas below as well as the smaller green blotches of 
paint along the edges were first placed on another piece of paper 
or glass and then, while still wet, were transferred to this sheet by 
rubbing or pressing. When this transfer process was completed the 
artist filled in the rest with watercolor. The conspicuous messiness 
of Spot Sounds contrasts with the rigidity of Sweetish (Siisslich, cat. 
no. 41). However, the apparent simplicity of the forms in Sweetish 
—all of which were drawn with ruler or compass— obscures the com- 
plexity of the technique: the support is opaque white over black 
paper. Thus, while Sweetish is reminiscent of Vertical Accent (cat. 
no. 26) or Unshakeable (cat. no. 31), it presages Kandinsky's work 
with gouache on black paper from 1935 to 1941 in Paris. Dreamy 
{Vertrdumt, cat. no. 42) which is virtually contemporary with 
Sweetish, exemplifies the layered complexity that Kandinsky 
achieved in his watercolors. By spraying watercolor in many stages 



as he rearranged positive and negative stencils, Kandinsky created 
secondary patterns and arrived at a preconceived composition. In 
Dreamy he has increased the degree of stratification but has re- 
stricted the colors to a more subtle and close-valued harmony than 
he had three years earlier in Evasive (cat. no. 30), which has vibrant 
green, blue and rose hues. 



From 1924 until 1934 Kandinsky did not record any watercolors 
as studies for oils in the Handlist. There are, however, at least two 
existing uncatalogued watercolor sketches for paintings from this 
decade: Study for "Yellow-Red-Blue" of 1925 and Study for "De- 
velopment in Brown" of 1933 (Grohmann, 1958, p. 409, cc 719, 
repr., p. 410, cc 735, repr.). After completing Development in 
Brown {Entwicklung in Braun, HL 594) in August, Kandinsky 
did not paint another canvas until six months later, after he had 
moved to Paris and established his home there in Neuilly-sur-Seine. 
Likewise, there is a hiatus in the watercolor Handlist from Septem- 
ber 1933 until April 1934. The first watercolors catalogued in the 
spring of 1934 bear titles of colors in French: Brun, Sur vert, Rose, 
Vert-noir and Bleu-noir. Stylistically, the watercolors proceed from 
the last Bauhaus work: for example, elements of the composition 
and the motif of Dark Situation from July 1933 {Trube Lage, HL 
517, Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) are dis- 
cernible in the Parisian oils, Yellow Center of 1934 and Two Green 
Points of 1935. A watercolor from July 193 1, Spotted {Fleckig, HL 
432), and a 1935 oil painting, Accompanied Contrast (fig. 6, Con- 
traste accompagne, HL 613), provide an exceptional instance of the 
link between Dessau and Paris. In the Handlist Kandinsky assigned 
the title Fleckig to the watercolor without any reference to an oil. In 
March 1935 he transformed this composition and color scheme 
into an intriguingly similar painting. The differentiation of the rec- 
tangular background wash zones and the spotted patches in the 
upper portion of the watercolor have been translated into subtle, 
slightly raised areas of fine sand in Accompanied Contrast. Further- 
more, in the Handlist Kandinsky titled a watercolor from August 
1934 Surface reunis and later amended it to read "Projet pour toile 
N" 616, 2 Points verts, 191s" (HL 535). However, in this case, he 
simplified and somewhat adapted the watercolor in the painting 
Two Green Points {Deux pointes vertes, HL 616) from April 1935 
which also combines oil and sand.

Between 1934 and 1941 the artist produced two hundred and 
eight watercolors and gouaches. Increasingly, he combined medi- 
ums. Since 1931 he had used tempera with oil and from 1934 he 
applied both watercolor and oil to the same canvas more often than 
earlier. According to the Handlist the first oils painted in Paris in- 
cluded watercolor with the medium: for example, Start (HL 595). 
Moreover, his work with sand and oil coincided with the move to 
Paris. In similar fashion, from 1933 Kandinsky noted in the water- 
color Handlist when he combined oil with watercolor or gouache 
with watercolor, primarily during 1934-35, in works considered to 
be watercolors. Thus, the categorization by medium was no longer 
exclusive and distinctions between them broke down. Kandinsky 
commonly used translucent watercolors together with gouache, that 
is, opaque colors mixed with gum preparation in water. 

Both Floating {Volant, cat. no. 45) and Varied Horizontals (Hor- 
izontals variees, cat. no. 46) were painted in gouache on black 
paper and both date from June 19 }6. The violet and blue floating 
shape of the former resembles that in the painting Dominant 
Curve from April 1936 (Collection The Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum) and generally shares an affinity with the curving, bio- 
morphic forms dominant in Kandinsky's Paris work. The compo- 
sition of Varied Horizontals consists of smaller elements quite sys- 
tematically organized around a central turquoise form. The colors 
appear to emanate from the black background: non-objective 
shapes seem detached, as if suspended in a void. 

In these late examples Kandinsky did not paint the supports as 
he had in works executed at the Bauhaus; instead, he selected black 
paper. Kenneth C. Lindsay (1951, pp. 157-159) was first to point 



out the importance of the black background in Kandinsky's early 
Jugendstil-inspired works and relate them to his late gouaches. 
Comparison of Supports from 1939 [Les Appuis, cat. no. 47) with 
The Night of 1907 (fig. 1) reveals striking similarities in color and 
technique which raise the possibility of an intentional return to an 
early technique. The artist obtained blotchy and dribbled effects 
with gouache in Supports. The opacity of the pigment suggests 
chalk, and the slight roughness of surface contributes to the abstract 
patterning of color zones. Stylistically, however, Supports remains 
consistent with Kandinsky's Bauhaus work (for example, cat. nos. 
17 and 31). 

Through 1939 Kandinsky assigned a title to each watercolor in 
the Handlist. However, he abandoned this practice in 1940 and the 
entries, which continue through number 730, are no longer so 
filled with information. Although no titles or months are indicated 
for the watercolors in the Handlist after 1940, Kandinsky methodi- 
cally noted the color of the supports: aq. s. noir, aq. s. creme fonce, 
aq. s. rouge-brun. He listed the first watercolor for 1940 (HL 634) 
as "Projet du No Gjj." In fact, not only this watercolor but also a 
detailed ink drawing are explicit studies for L'Ensemble (HL 671). 

There is a preparatory ink drawing from 1939 (fig. 7) for one of 
the Untitled gouaches from 1940 in this exhibition (cat. no. 48, HL 
639). What is positive (black) in the drawing is negative in the 
gouache. The reversal of black and white emphasizes the spatial 
and coloristic possibilities inherent in the medium with black back- 
ground. In this gouache the artist drew most of the imagina- 
tive, rounded forms freehand, using a compass only for the circles. 
However, restraint and decorative intricacy remain dominant. In

EXPLANATORY NOTES 



1939-40 Kandinsky executed a significant number of extremely 
detailed ink studies for such 1940 oil paintings as Little Accents 
(HL 670), L'Ensemble (HL 671) and Sky Blue (HL 673). Similar 
instances where watercolors and oils follow precise drawings occur 
from 194 1 to 1944. In addition, Kandinsky painted several water- 
color studies for oils: for example, Moderation (HL 678, Collection 
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) corresponds to an untitled 
1940 watercolor (HL 651) and Reduced Contrasts (HL 681) ap- 
proximates an untitled 1941 watercolor (HL 721). 

While the frequency of preliminary studies for oils around 1940 
makes one think of the watercolors which closely resembled paint- 
ings in 1923, their relationship differs and the circumstances sur- 
rounding their creation are dissimilar. The 1923 watercolors ini- 
tiated a period of innovation and stylistic development. In the 
early watercolors Kandinsky experimented with style as well as 
technique. The late gouaches and watercolors are the work of an 
experienced master in his early seventies who had conquered the 
challenges of the medium. They reflect a simplification of tech- 
niques and consolidation of stylistic tendencies. Within the con- 
fines of the late work, Kandinsky elaborated upon diverse images. 

Undeniably, after 1934 the watercolors are no longer as inde- 
pendent of the oils as they were during the preceding decade. The 
more direct relationship between watercolors and oils suggests a 
parallel to the work from 191 1 to 1914. During this period water- 
colors were frequently preparatory studies for paintings and, in 
general, they can be clustered around specific pictures. As has been 
demonstrated, these correspondences change in subsequent years, 
and the greatest discrepancies occur between 1924 and 1933 when 
the artist was at the Bauhaus. Despite fluctuations, however, Kan- 
dinsky's oeuvre possesses a continuity of style irrespective of 
medium. Moreover, there are recurring instances where oils ap- 
proximate watercolors: Light Picture of 191 3, On White of 1923, 
On Points of 1928, Accompanied Contrast of 1935 and Moderation 
of 1940. Throughout Kandinsky's career there are moments when 
the distance between watercolor and oil disappears and when the 
innovations in watercolor provide the initial impetus for major 
paintings. 



Titles: 

Kandinsky's Handlist assigns titles to most of his 
works. When no artist's title is provided and when 
the watercolor is not specifically related to an oil, 
it is called Untitled. All of Kandinsky's titles have 
been translated into English in this catalogue; how- 
ever, the titles are usually cited in their original 
language as well. 

Measurements: 

Dimensions are given in inches followed by centi- 
meters. Height precedes width; measurements are
