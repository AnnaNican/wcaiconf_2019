JOAN MIRO is a lowering figure in the landscape of modern ail. Il may be said of him. 
as of few others, thai our vision ‚Äî whal we see as line and real in our age would he severely 
impoverished without his images and his forms‚Äî a conjunction thai first presented itself in 
the harsh context of modernism before it was so absorbed in our general awareness as to be- 
come an inseparable part of it. 

Admiration for Mini and his work is not a recent altitude al the Guggenheim Museum. 
Seven important works have entered our permanent collection ‚Äî the first as early as L948, the 
most recent in 1969 ‚Äî and Mini, in 1958, was the recipient of the Guggenheim International 
Award. Despite this long-standing and reciprocated friendship with the artist, an important 
exhibition kept eluding us. That such an event should finally come about is therefore a source 
of great satisfaction, one by no means diminished by its long and complex period of gestation. 

A full retrospective of Mini's work was presented in New York by The Museum ol Modern 
Art in 1959, and I thereafter approached Mini in behalf of the Guggenheim with the proposal 
to show his recent work. The suggestion was immediately accepted and was confirmed during 
a summer visit to his studio in Palma de Majorca in 1968. In the same year. Rosalind E. 
Krauss, then Assistant Professor at M.I.T. submitted an intriguing exhibition plan which 
would extend the scope of inquiry into Mini's earlier development without falling back upon a 
retrospective formal. Sensing a significant rhythm in the artist's evolution, she proposed to ex- 
plore the visual and conceptual relationship between Mini's painting of the 1920s and that of 
the 1960s. 

Mini received the new outline with enthusiasm. Soon it became evident that the chosen 
theme was more intricate and recpiired more elaboration than had appeared at the outset. I bus. 
the aid of Margit Rowell, now the Guggenheim's Associate Curator, was enlisted to contrib- 
ute to the formulation and the realization of the exhibition as it now stands. She had just com- 
pleted a Mini monograph, published as Miro by Harry N. Abrams. Inc. 1971. 

The present exhibition and its catalogue are therefore the fruits of a close and mutually 
enriching collaboration between Rosalind Krauss and Margit Rowell. The organizers would 
nevertheless have failed in their endeavour had they not been so consistently supported by .loan 
Miro himself and by his American and European gallery representatives: Pierre Matisse in 
New York and Aime Maeght as well as Jacques Dupin in Paris. Baptized eventually as Joan 
Mini: Magnetic Fields, the exhibition made its own appeal to prospective lenders in this 
country and abroad who manifested their belief in the artist and in the concept of the exhibition 
through their generous loans. 

Magnetic Fields, it should be stressed in closing, is based upon a theme which we hope will 
add an informative and valid insight to the enjoyment of the works here gathered. The reali- 
zation of the show and this publication depended upon a concerted effort of the Guggenheim's 
staff and was made possible through a much needed and appreciated grant from the National 
Endowment for the Arts.

Because they depend on being performed, music and dance and theater engage in constant acts 
of self-renew al. Each performance of a work reinterprets it ‚Äî recasts its accents and emotions 
with no single performance ever exhausting the fund of possibilities the work contains. Compar- 
ed to this, painting or poetry seem static and immutable: a constellation of images immobilized 
on a surface and that surface pinioned to a wall, or a sequence of phrases etched by their very 
fixity into the blank inertness of the page. But the inexhaustibility of poetry or painting is no 
less than that of the performing arts; it simply lies elsewhere. It involves a continual return to 
the work whose content can never be depleted, for there are always new levels of perception onto 
which it will open and new realms of experience which it will address. If this is time for a single 
painting, it is equally true of all the works that make up the art of any one man. It is true as 
well of Mho's art, which one always thought one knew . 

Miro's work had seemed easy to visualize: an art dense with metaphor, a bestiary in which 
man, woman and animal exchanged substance against a background fluid with shifting colors. 
One thought of it as an alchemical world filled with cosmic signs, or as a place where creatures 
in endless metamorphosis briefly brushed against each other only to separate again and brush 
against the sky. It seemed to be an art that was essentially dense, populous, studded with 
figurative incident; an art whose internal scale was marked by the horror vacui of the minia- 
turist, even though it was sometimes projected to the mural size of the processional frieze. 

Yet there is another Miro: painting that risked emptiness to court an extreme openness filled 
only with the pulsation of unimpeded color. Turning his back on metaphor Miro, in this phase 
of his painting, discovered the kind of drawing that the French call icriture ‚Äî a descriptive line 
pushed toward the abstract disembodiment of the written sign. In this painting Miro developed 
an internal structure, based on color, which already implied a vast scale. It was a structure that 
had so little to do with the esprit nouveau of developed French Cubism that even by the mid- 
twenties it had dissolved the normal easel picture and had moved towards a radically expanded 
field. 

Concentrated into two phases of Miro's career, this other aspect of his art is constituted by the 
1 15 or so paintings which Miro made in the years 1925 to 1927. and many of the ambitious 
pictures he has painted since 1960. Some of the paintings have been seen before; others have 
neither been exhibited nor reproduced. Never have these works been brought together in a 
coherent way. In early discussions of Mini's art they were largely ignored. Recently this has 
changed. In an effort to intercept their conceptual thrust, the writers who discuss them have 
grouped the works according to various designations: "Dream-Pictures" is one of these ^another 
is "Automatic Painting." 2 For many reasons neither of these seems really correct . 

1 Jacques Dupin. the author of the most definitive study of Miro's career, collects the works of the mid- 
twenties under this heading-, saying ‚ñ†"the atmosphere they give off ... is a purely oneiric atmosphere." 
Jacques Dupin, Joan Miro, Harry N. Ahrams, New York, 1962, p. 157. 

2 See William Rubin, Dada and Surrealist Art, Harry N. Ahrams. New York, 1969. p. 156. The exhibition 
Dada. Surrealism, and their Heritage, which Mr. Rubin organized at The Museum of Modern Art in 1968, 
brought together a select number of these paintings for the first time in this country, focusing on their 
importance in Miro's ceuvre.

The present exhibition collects these pictures under the title "Magnetic Fields" ‚Äî and of 
(nurse, like any title, there is in this one a mixture of accuracy and partisanship, of objective 
description and interpretation. There is as well the presence of an historical marker. For 
"Magnetic Fields" in French is Les Champs magnitiques ‚Äî the name of a little book which two 
poets published jointly in I!&gt;20 in an attempt by the not-yet-official Surrealists to break the 
hack of traditional literary genres. In 1.,-^ Champs magnitiques the concern to create an un- 
interrupted field ol language parallels the concern Miro came to by the mid-twenties: to make 
painting from an uninterrupted field of color. Further, both hook and painting shared the 
problem of inventing a language which would simultaneously describe the world of objects and 
t he opacity of the medium that renders them- w hether that medium he line or words. 

Five years before he composed The Surrealist Manifesto. Andre Breton collaborated with 
Philippe Soupault on the texts grouped together as Les Champs magnitiques. 3 Although each of 
the prose sections of the Champs was authored singly by either Breton or Soupault, a collective 
strategy unifies the texts, ft is a strategy bent on dispossessing the characteristic features of 
narrative, on re\ oking both the sequential ordering of events and the mood of the past tense that 
inevitably colors the narration nt an event re-told. The voice the reader hears may he describ- 
ing feedings of alienation as the author moves across the city, or memories of childhood, or the 
fatigue ol a traveler in the depths of the countryside. But always a sense of fragmentation, an 
effect of incoherence dogs the description, muffling the sound of the tale to create an auditory 
space in which the tone of the teller, "speaking in the present." emerges at each moment of the 
reading. Les Champs magnitiques which Breton later called "the fruit of the first systematic 
application of automatic writing," 4 is an extended field of images. And the curious thing about 
these images is that it feels as though they are being created in the presence of the reader, at each 



3 Anna Balakian argues thai Breton's ideas about automatic writing were formed by Ins reading of Pierre 
Janet's /.' iutomatisme psychologique, 1889, as indeed most of his basic understanding of psychoanalytic 
thought depended on Janet the leading psychiatric authority in France and the teacher of Jung. After 
Breton's death. Soupault disclosed to Dr. Balakian tin- source of the title for Les Champs magnetiques. It 
was, he said, a term used 1&gt;\ Janet which he ami Breton discovered at the same time as they happened into 
an exhibition in the Bois de Boulogne where there were displayed graphic- representations of magnetic 
fields. See Vnna Balakian, indrd Breton, Oxford University Press. ."New York, 1971, pp.28, 61. One 
further li\ po thesis about w h\ this name was attractive to the two young poets is that having steeped them- 
selves m the poetrj of Lautreamont indeed in 1919 Breton had transcribed Lautreamont's Podsies from 
the onlj known copj in the Bibliotheque Rationale and revering his Les ('hunts de Maldoror as the most 
intoxicating and free poetic work the\ knew. Breton and Soupault used Les Champs magnitiques as a 
- acronym and rhyme on the title of Lautreamont's great work. Chomps and chants sound the 
same in French, and both titles possess the initials LCM. For a textual comparison between the two works 
see Herbert Gershman, The Surrealist Revolution in France. University id' Michigan Press, \nn Arbor. 
1969, p. 40.)

moment of contact. As another Surrealist poet, Robert Desnos, was to insist somewhat later. 
"the sole tense of the verb is the present indicative." 5 The immediacy of that tense was some- 
thing Breton was not to relinquish. When he writes in the sequel to the Champs, "Less time 
than it takes to tell, fewer tears than it takes to die: 1 have counted everything, and there you 
are," 6 he drives into the flow of the conversational mode a kind of self-reflexive wedge which 
seems to operate in the present to transform experience into its image ‚Äî to change emotion into 
the set of verbal signs which represent it. 

The ambition of Les Champs magnetiques is given in the title of the first of its texts: I a 
Glace sans tain." The mirror without silvering was to he language that could cut two ways. It 
was to reflect the speaker hack to himself even as it was to be transparent, allow ing the speaker's 
subjectivity to flood past him and merge with the whole of the world outside. "Do not," Breton 
cautions, "disturb the genius planter of white roots, my nerve-endings in the earth."' Not only 
was language to be exposed in its most dispersed, most flamboyant possibilities of association, 
but because of the presentness of the tense maintained, it was always to lie laying bare its 
properties as language. Thus the mirror reflected back at the reader the arbitrary nature of the 
written sign at the same time as it displayed the magic of its transparent power to represent. 
"My two crossed hands represent the celestial vault and my head is a goose grotesque and bald." 8 

Automatism ‚Äî the act of writing without the censorship of any preconceived structure or 
subject ‚Äî may have been the ground-rules of Les Champs magnetiques. but is was not the goal 
Breton and Soupault were driving toward. The same is true of Miro's paintings of the mid and 
late twenties. There is in them, as we shall see, the ambition to create "la place san\ tain" ‚Äî the 
unsilvered, or one-way mirror. 

Beginning in 1925, the pictures began to come from Mho's brush at a stunning rate of speed. 
In the years just before, Miro's meticulous workmanship, his painstakingly wrought detail on 
surfaces brushed to an enamel-like smoothness and density, had meant a severely limited out- 
put. 9 But in 192 5 Miro's palette changed. The variegated colors of The Tilled Field and The 
Harlequin's Carnival were simplified down to monochromes of blue or sienna or bister. Miro

applied these colors in radically thinned washes over the whole surface of ihe canvas. Within 
these loosely-brushed expanses. Mini traced a sequence of images which he executed in hair- 
thin lines of astonishing circumspection and reticence. It was as though part of Mini's thinking 
in these paintings was focused on the problem of how to deprive line of its "natural" weight. 
A line that was allowed to curve back on itself to close the contour of a figure would interrupt 
the liquidity of the color field, damming its 1 low by the suggestion of a corporeal presence. The 
same is true of a line that is shaded or thick: it would infiltrate the space of these pictures with 
references to the physical world where the density of mass is underlined by the shadow it casts 
or the matter it displaces. 

Consequently Mir6's line turns away from description in these paintings, and becomes some- 
thing else. In places it is perforated, a dotted line marking an object's placement within the 
space of the picture, without however embodying the object (as in The Siesta, cat. no. 13). Klse- 
w here ( in Head o] a Vat (dan Peasant^ cat. no. 9) it straightens and elongates as two axes, north/ 
south and east/west, crossing at the center of the pictorial field ‚Äî the vertical one surmounted by 
a small red shape which is the cap of the Catalan peasant. Through the cross which serves as the 
painting's structure, the body is represented without being materialized. At other places the line 
becomes pictograph, charging the field with Mho's own special meanings and associations: the 
ladder with converging uprights (as in Landscape with Rooster and Landscape called The 
Grasshopper, cat. no. 24) becomes a sign for the visual continuities that run like currents 
through the very depths of space: the circle or point with flame-like appendages is a sign for 
sexual excitement (in The Kiss, cat. no. 6 and Romeo and Juliet, cat. no. 20). In still other places 
the line becomes simply writing ‚Äî a poem or a phrase stretching across the field ("Lc corps de 
ma brune . . .." cat. no. 15). And indeed it is in the context of the written word that line is most 
characteristically stripped of weight to become the non-descriptive, non-pictorial carrier of 
meaning. For the reader knows without thinking that the letters which make up the written 
word are abstract signs and not objects, inhabiting a world of signification rather than a world 
of mimesis. 

It is the consistency with which Mho addresses himself to this question of the pictorial 
function of his line, and the originality of his use of it to structure an open, luminous field, that 
constitute the formal revelation of these pictures. Indeed it is this clear concentration or focus of 
Mho's formal intelligence within these works that makes the description of them as "dream" or 
"automatic" pictures so unsatisfactory. Just as Breton tended to obscure the formal issues in 
Lei Champs magndtiques behind the cloudy notion of "automatic writing." Mho has also side- 
tracked questions about the structure of his work in the mid-twenties. Miro has said that at a 
point in his career just pre\ ions to these pictures he made a series of drawings while in a state of 
hunger-induced hallucination. 10 lie has also spoken ol the effect of both images made by rapid

random drawing 11 and hypnogogic images' 2 on a few of the "magnetic field" pictures. As well, 
he has indicated thai the conditions of the dream stale form part of the con/cut of these works, 
particularly the ones on blue grounds. 13 But it is the radical formal integration of these paint- 
ings that testifies to the high level of consciousness operating on them as a whole. The thought- 
process behind Miro's pictorial use of the sign, which ibis texl \\ ill lake up in some detail, ' was 
not carried on in a trance-like loss of control. And further, the use of a large number of spec it L&lt; . 
carefully selected visual and poetic sources ‚Äî discussed elsewhere in ibis catalogue 1 * ‚Äî bears 
witness to a high degree of thought about the image's meaning. In the paintings of this period 
Miro was no more an automatic painter than Kandinsky or Matisse or Klee ‚Äî and no less. 



The question that haunts these pictures is the one of space. Their roots are in Miro's earlier 
work with the specific, real space of landscape; their apotheosis is in a return to landscape, but 
at an entirely new level of formal thinking. To move from the first stage to the last involved 
Miro in the problem of how to represent space without constructing an illusion of it . 

The distinction between those two things, representation and illusionism, was important for 
Miro. It is a distinction which turns on the strangely asymmetrical relationship between repre- 
sentation and resemblance. We speak of a picture as representing one or a group of objects; a 
portrait, for example, is said to represent its sitter. And the success of the portrait as a repre- 
sentation is thought to lie in the closeness of the resemblance. But the seeming correspondence 
between resemblance and representation is in fact misleading. Two things which resemble ea&lt; b 
other almost absolutely ‚Äî a pair of twins for example, or two copies of the same book ‚Äî cannot 
be said to represent one another. And conversely, an object may be represented by something 
which does not resemble it at all ‚Äî a country by its flag, or the color red by I lie word "red", in 



U Miro described the genesis of "Oh! un de ces messieurs . . ." in conversation with the authors, as an example 
of this. See discussion, cat. no. 12.

authors that its dotted comma-shaped forms and spirals recreated the phantom images which, in a half- 
waking state, he saw as if projected on the ceiling of his room. 

13 See Margit Rowell's discussion of "Photo: ceci est la couleur tic mes rives," pp. 60 If., below. 

1* In 1958 Miro was asked if he thought of his paintings as ideograms. "Yes," he replied, "they are ideo- 
grams." See Edouard Roditi, "Miro Interview." irts, vol. 55. no. 1. October 1958, p. 48. There is a long 
tradition of describing the objects within Miro's paintings as symbols or signs constituting an ideogram, 
yet the wav these signs might function either conceptually or formally is never made clear. See: Michel 
Leiris, "Joan Miro," Documents, no. 5, October 1929, p. 265, and The Prints of Joan Miro, Curt Valentin,

fact, il is Impossible for a representation to coincide completely with the thing represented. 16 

\ c[ illusionistic painting blurs the difference between representation and resemblance, try- 
ing lo match up lliis thing in the picture with that thing in the world. In that sense il is like 
aaturalistic \\ riting \\ hich does not wish to call attention to the arbil rariness of the medium in 
which it is made. Pari of the burden of Les Champs magnitiques had been to create the "uii- 
silvered mirror. '" to use words to show the distance between resemblance and language. By the 
mid-twenties Mini, too, had moved tar away from thinking of painting as a matter of resem- 
blances. Rather, it had become for him a task of representation which is "naturally" somewhere 
else. In 192"), Mini had finally pushed the representation of space into that other place which is 
primarily the domain of the sign. It was a long [tush that began in his work in the late teens, 
and one can follow its course step by step. 

From The Trail of 1 9 1 cS dig. 2) to fines and Olive Trees of the following year, to The Farm 
of 192 1 22 (fig. 22). lo the earliest work in this exhibition. The Tilled Field of 1921 2 1 (cat. 
no. 1 ). there is a continuous transformation of the means that Mini uses lo describe the land- 
scape's space. The sandy soil of The 'Frail is modeled in delicate blues and pinks to describe the 
furrows and ruts which mark its terrain. But because these parallel furrows also form a loose 
svslem of converging lines, the depiction of the actual ground doubles as a representation of 
perspective. So that the conventional pictorial system for describing deep space appears lo be 
mapped onto an illusion of deep space. Perspective itself thus begins to surface as a flat pattern 
of convergence fused somewhat arbitrarily with the natural forms of the shifting soil. 

This progressive transformation of perspective into the appearance of an arbitrary pattern 
deepens throughout the work Mini executed between 1918 and 1925. In The Tilled Field, depth 
is largely stylized into separate systems of parallel lines that enact the rows of furrows raised by 
the farmer's plow. In places these patterns seem to support the perspective convention which 
grounds Western illusionism, for in the middle section of the work, they are directed diagonallv 
low aid w hat would be the vanishing point at the center of the painting. But at the left and right 
of the picture they read simply as vertical and horizontal slriations, resolutely disconnected 
from any one overriding strategy of organizing the depth of the work. Instead they participate 
in the kind of description Mini had seen in Medieval Catalan fresco painting, where depth is 
symbolized in the I lat rather than absorbed into a system of illusion. 1 ' 

In The Hunter (cat. no. 2). painted just alter The Tilled Field, this flattening of space into 
descriptive sign is carried out by color rather than pattern. The closeness oi value between pale 



16 This discussion depends in Large pari on Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art. Bobbs-Merrill, New York, 
1968, p. 6 II. when' it is much more closelj argued. 

17 This kind of patterning of the field appears, for example, in the Creation Tapestry from the Gerona 
Cathedra] fig. I") . where there is also an arrangement ami a stylization of the animals grouped around 
the hock of water which suggests the composition of the lower right side of The Tdlcd Field. Another 
device from Catalan Romanesque frescoes is suggestive for this painting: the decoration of tin- bodies of 
i he evangelists w ith disembodied eyes in the cycle from Sant Climenl de Taull fig. 24 .

pink ground and yellow sea and sky creates a continuous fabric seamed at their line of meet- 
ing ‚Äî a continuous fabric on which near and far begin to lake on a kind of equivalence. A 
strange loss of scale -difference further drains illnsionism from the painting, as all of the solid 
elements within it are drawn approximately the same size. The head and tail of the fish in the 
foreground, the gun held by the hunter standing further hark, the boat riding the distant sea. 
the sun. the letters SARD in the lower right corner ‚Äî all occupy about the same area of the 
w oiks surface : all seem to have the same visual \\ eight. At the same time, the connective tissue 
between these (dements the bodies of animals and men ‚Äî has heen eaten away, reduced to a 
sequence of line, stem -like graph isms. Straight, w a\ v. perforated, these lines tend to disembody 
the objects which people The Hunter, to deprive them of mass, to push them toward habitation 
within the weightless ideographic space of the diagram. 

There is thus a double indeterminacy within the luminous space of The Hunter. There is a 
\ isual indeterminacy in relation to the placement of objects ‚Äî as "near" and "far" seem to shift 
[ike so main currents within the fluidity of the color field. And there isastrange indeterminacy 
as to the representational mode being used. For the traditional worlds of naturalistic, diagram- 
matic, and verbal description are no longer separate worlds. Instead they seem to converge in a 
space in which words take on the weight and density of objects, and objects reach for the 
spatially non-corporeal quality of the mechanical or anatomical diagram. 111 The Hunter is the 
first of Mini's long series of tense syntheses of the normally separate spaces of looking and read- 
ing. I n the w orks that follow it. Mini performs this synthesis with an increasing simplicity. 

To discover that economy ol means, one has simply to turn to the 1925 Head of a Catalan 
Peasant (cat. no. 9). Entirely flooded by an unevenly brushed wash of cerulean blue, the field 
of this painting makes only one concession to the worldly distinction between earth and sky. A 
line black line with a small knob at its Left terminus bisects the field horizontally. Its effects is 
to conjure up that perceptual crease in the fabric ol real space which is the line ol the horizon. 
Somewhat left of center another line -this one vertical ‚Äî moves upward from tin' bottom edge 
of the canvas. Near the top of the painting this line attaches itself to a small red and white form 
that depicts the knitted cap of the peasant as a shape resembling a reversed question-mark. At 
the upper right corner a brief red streak hovers over one while and two black dots in a figural ion 
like a skewed exclamation point. A small black shooting star sputtering trails of dotted lines and 
a smaller while star complete the work. 

The simplicity of that crossed pair of lines unites at least lour readings of the picture which 
resonate back and forth w ithin the blue expanse of its field. Briefly, these are : line as the means 
of drawing objects: line as the mechanism of depicting space (by separating figure from 
ground): line as writing (with the temporal associations of the way signs are read): and line as 
surface -structure (with the instantaneous, spatial qualities of l he way pictures are seen). Within 
the painting, each of these readings acts as a separate argument about the nature of representa- 

m The kind &lt;if diagrammatic drawing thai appears here owes much to the kind of drawings with which 
Picabia was illustrating his magazines &gt;'"/ and Cannibale. Mini explicitly uses Picabia's automata in 
other of his works from 1924, for example Pastoral cat. no. 3 .

lion. But because each is constructed from the same elements as the others, all readings stand in 
an absolute paritj ‚Äî opening onto each other, [lowing into each other within the visual fluidity 
of the blue wash. 

Initially one reads the crossed lines as an integral unit ‚Äî a standing figure with its arms out- 
stretched, reaching laterally towards the outer boundaries of ils pictorial world. But a second 
reading insinuates an undefined distance between the two axes by making the horizontal one 
reconfirm the color depth of the field and appear as a horizon line. This reading drives a per- 
ceptual wedge between the isolated vertical of a body in the foreground and the horizon line 
which is associated with ihe furthermost reaches of the color space. 19 Like a taut bow-string 
resonating under the viewer's very act of looking, the picture's horizontal axis pulses between its 
proximate position as part of the figure and its infinite one as an outpost of space. In thai 
constant flex of the blue field as it opens up and closes down, one seems to become witness lo 
the reflexive act of consciousness that is the beginning of Western pictorial illusion ‚Äî as the 
sign is torn from the indeterminate space of the ideogram and invested with the determination 
of near figure against distant ground. The continual shift backwards and forwards is thus 
between recognizing an object and giving it a space. 

The second two readings parallel these first two, except that here the shift is between line as 
the bearer of meaning and line as the means to formal structure. In the context of the verbal 
signs which surround it ‚Äî the reversed question mark and the exclamation point ‚Äî the attenuat- 
ed figure seems to exist in the pictographic, non-dimensional space of line hovering at the birth 
of writing. Yet this reading, too, flows directly into another which is its opposite. For the crossed 
axes exist as a rudimentary schema of perspective, a bifurcated horizon line which divides the 
illusioned world into left and right, up and down, at the same time as it sections the flat field 
of the canvas into four quadrants. Becoming a sign for the space that is internal lo painting, it 
locates a point of focus, and equates the legibility of the visible world with the organization of 
the rectilinear picture surface. 

In the first pair of readings the diastole of the line opens and closes the space of the field: in 
the second pair it transforms and retransforms the field itself ‚Äî associating it now with the 
non-specific space of the page, now with the absolute specificity of the unique picture (and by 
extension with the specificity of the space of the natural world). 



19 A 1924 drawing (fig. 4^ depicts the single, detached vertical of the body against a perspective into depth 
drawn bv three converging lines. Not only does the drawing present in its clearest form Miro's structure 
of the vertical bisecting the canvas, crossed by a schema for depth, it also relates to the developing personal 
image-langnage Miro was increasingly to use. The vertical figure is at one and the same time a candle and 
a human body, flowing hair doubling as flame. (In 1924 Miro also punned visually on the female body 
represented as a kerosene lamp. See discussion, cat. nos. 5, 20.) Further, the perspective schema coming in 
from the corners of the page is repeated in later works fig. 14), where it is absorbed into a symbolic 
language. 

Jacques Dupin sees the 1924 Portrait of Madame K. as showing a body composed of crossed axes which 
follow "the dimensions of the painting,'' and speaks of the axes as relating to the landscape: the vertical 
connecting earth and sky. the horizontal an ‚ñ†‚ñ†equinoctial equator." Dupin. op. cit.. pp. 146-47.

\\ hat Miro has created here is a pictorial mobility that does not simply imitate the naturally 
fluid media of water, for example, or air. It is a medium in which stales of being rather than 
physical things seem to meet and exchange places. It is like "la glace sans tain": the space of 
a consciousness which can contemplate an endless chain of associations moving from verbal to 
\ isual symbol systems and at the same time never lose a grip on its own objective identity. The 
essential constituents of this space are: the liberation of color into field; a weightless, calli- 
graphic line; and the simultaneous use of the image as sign and structure. 

Behind this fluid, shifting space which Miro created, alone among his contemporaries, one 
hears the echo of the poets whom he most loved and admired. One hears Eluard's '"Clasped 
hands have no weight," 20 and thinks of Miro's line. Or further back there is Mallarme's im- 
agery of horizontal transformation: 



Vertige! void que frissonne 
L'espace comme un grand baiser 

Sens -tit le paradis farouche 
Ainsi quun rire enseveli 
Se couler du coin de la bouche 
Au fondde Vunanime pli! 21 

O intoxication! Space quivers 
Like a great kiss 

Do you feel the diffident paradise 
Like entombed laughter 
Flowing from the corner of your mouth 
Into the universal wrinkle?

And there is Rimbaud's imagery of sensuously weightless fall : 

La douceur flcurie des etoiles et du ciel du reste descend en face du tallies, comme un 
panier, contre notre face, et fait Vabime fleurant et bleu ld-dessous. 22 

Across from the hillside, the flowery sweetness of the stars, and of the sky, and of the rest 
descends upon our face like a basket; and creates the blossoming, blue abyss below. 



This was the poetic context in which Miro centered his art, as daily he sought out the young 
poets of the Litterature group and silently he attended the discussions in which they mapped 
out their poetic concerns. 23 Their company was as important to him as that of fellow painters, 
and in all of his interviews, Miro stresses the centrality of poetry for him ‚Äî naming Rimbaud 
and Jarry, Eluard and Apollinaire. Indeed, of all the visual sources to which one could pos- 
sibly turn to find the grounds on which Miro built his art of the mid-twenties, the most im- 
portant is surely the visual/verbal redoubling of that aberrant poetic form which is the calli- 
gramme. Formed in the shape of an object, the calligramme actually looks like the thing the 
words describe. (See figs. 5-7.) Of all the work of Miro's fellow painters, the only two things 
which really seem to have been crucial to his formal thinking in these pictures were: a little 
book of Klee reproductions which Andre Masson showed Miro in 1924, and a stage set by 
Picasso for the ballet Mercure in the same year. But the importance of these two seems to reside 
in the fact that they gave Miro a kind of access to the calligramme, hinting to him a way to 
integrate it into his art. 

Although the calligramme is an ancient form 24 it entered the consciousness of this century's 
poets and painters through the efforts of Guillaume Apollinaire. Although the volume titled 
Calligrammes was not published until 1918, Apollinaire's poems in this medium had begun to 
appear in avant-garde journals like Les Soirees de Paris and SIC as early as 1914. 23 Following 
Apollinaire's lead, other writers attempted this form, for example Pierre Albert-Birot (the 
editor of SIC), who had published his own work in the medium by 1918. In 1917 the calli- 
grammes of Vincent Huidobro mark the spread of the genre into the advanced literary circles of

University of Chicago, 1970, p. 248. For Miro's notion of the "blue abyss" see discussion, p. 61. 

23 Miro said of 1925, "I went quite a bit that year with poets because I felt that it was necessary to go a 
step beyond the strictly plastic and bring some poetry into painting." Miro, "Je reve d'un grand atelier," 
op. cit., p. 26. 

24 In 1925 UEsprit nouveau published calligrammes from the third century B. C, and from the 14th and 
18th centuries, in an article titled "Les Ancetres des ideogrammes."' See L'Esprit nouveau, no. 27, 1925. 

25 In Les Soirees de Paris on June 15, 1914 and in SIC throughout 1916.

Fig. &gt;'. Guilkuiine Apollinaire. // PIcut. 1917 






Spain (fig. 6). 26 Mini's knowledge of the calligramme surely had begun even before he left 
Barcelona for Paris. By 1925 the calligramme had already been lilted out of whatever possible 
obscurity remained to it and canonized as part of the official sensibility of L'Espril nouveau, 
in the issue dedicated to Apollinaire. 27 

Very simply, the calligramme is a poem which creates an image simultaneously in visual and 
verbal form. Michel Foucaull observes of the calligramme that it takes the muteness of the line 
which bounds the drawn figure and makes it speak by filling it with words: and takes the spa I ial 
indifference of words written on a page and makes them bow to the law of simultaneous form 
which operates within the world of vision. Foucault continues : 

For the instantaneous glance reduces phoneticism to being only a kind of grey chatter wliich 
completes the contours of a figure; hut it makes of the drawing the thin envelope which one 
must tear open in order to follow ‚Äî from word to word ‚Äî the unwinding of its textual in- 
sides . . . The calligramme makes use of the property of letters by which they are simulta- 
neously linear elements which one can arrange in space, and signs which must unroll accord- 
ing to the special chain of the aural substance. As a sign, the letter permits the firing of words ; 
as a line it permits t/ie figuration of objects. In this way the calligramme seems to efface the 
oldest oppositions of alphabetic civilization: showing and naming; drawing and speaking; 
reproducing and articulating ; imitating and signifying ; looking and reading. 

Capturing or enclosing twice the thing of which it speaks, it holds it in the most perfect trap. 
It guarantees this capture by its double entry of which discourse by itself or pure drawing is 
not capable. It conjures up the invincible absence which words cannot succeed in overcoming, 
in imposing on them, by the ruse of a text played out in space, the visible form of their 
referent : cannilv deplored on the sheet of paper, the signs call forth the very things of which 
they speak by means of the external margin of their design, the cutting out of their mass on 
the empty space of the page. And in return, the visible form is hollowed out by writing, rip- 
ped up by the words which work from the inside of the form, and which, conjuring up the 
immobile, ambiguous, unnamable presence, make a network of significations gush forth 
which baptize, determine, fix the form within the form within the universe of discourse.-" 

fn Miro's "Un oiseau poursuit une abcille et la baisse" (cat. no. 25), the operation of the in- 
scribed words is close to that of the calligramme, yet the result is ‚Äî like that of Head of a 
Catalan Peasant ‚Äî that Miro's line works at the level of pictorial structure as well as that of 
verbal/visual conflation. Functioning within two separate systems, the words identify parts of

the canvas as up and down, and near and far. On the level of literal meaning, "un oiseau" (a 
bird) fixes the upper reaches of the canvas as sky; while "baisse" (lower) asserts the downward 
pull of the picture's lower half. But the calligraphy also establishes ils visual identity as draw - 
ing due to the size difference between the smaller and finer depiction of "un oiseau" and the 
larger and heavier script of "et la baisse." This pictorial nature of the space is further enhanced 
by the three circular areas of color ‚Äî blue, yellow, and white ‚Äî which seem to overlap one an- 
other within the space of the field, receding one behind the other even while they are also 
manifestly applied to the raw canvas surface. Linking these three areas through the illusioned 
depth of the picture's space, the attenuated calligraphy of " poursuit" becomes a simultaneously 
visual/verbal image of flight or recession. Like a purely visual element, it draws a linear 
diagonal which binds together the field's total presentness. In its capacity as a word, it predicates 
the relationship between subject and object. And throughout, the doubleness of these visual/ 
verbal elements underscores and is underscored by the dual meaning of the phrase itself. 29 

If the calligramme establishes two of the poles of Miro's line ‚Äî between which the spectator 
can pass from reading to looking and back again ‚Äî the calligramme does not relate to the other 
two poles between which Miro forces his line to oscillate in order to deal with painting per se. 
Along that second continuum Miro uses ecriture to assert the depth of the field and to struc- 
ture that field according to a formal logic. "Poursuit" after all does more than just denote an 
action which the gestural writing echoes through mime. It also serves as a diagonal fulcrum 
balancing the sign for perspective recession against a transverse segmentation of the flat plane. 
Thus "poursuit" performs on the level of structure, like the multiplex cross in Head of a 
Catalan Peasant which 1) underscores a recession deep into space through the arms/horizon 
line, and 2) suggests a necessary connection between the conventional ways of transferring 
real space onto a flat plane (perspective) and the conventional format of the picture's shape (a 
rectangle bisected horizontally and vertically). As a simple silhouette, floating in a neutral 
space, the calligramme cannot address itself to either of these issues. The calligramme. therefore, 
can be understood as only a partial source for the pictorial invention one finds in the "magnetic 
fields." 

It might appear that there is an obvious place one could turn to find words or lettering used 
for that function of pictorial structure: namely, collage and its literary off -shoot, concrete 
poetry. But it seems clear that the use of lettering and words in Cubist and Dadaist contexts has 
in fact little to do with the formal meaning of Miro's ecriture. 

Beginning in 1911-12 in the collages of Picasso and Braque, words and word-fragments 
stencilled onto the canvas began to fluctuate forwards and backwards within the picture field. 
Associating themselves with an object located inside the space of the painting ‚Äî serving for 
example as the label of a bottle or as the heading of a newspaper foreshortened on a table ‚Äî the 
letters also proclaimed themselves to be appliqueed upon the surface of the picture. Laying siege 
to two positions at once, the lettering seemed to be inside the picture as well as on its surface. 

29 See Margit Ro\vell"s essay, pp. 58-60 below.

A similar kind of fluctuation occurs in the world of concrete poetry. There, shifts in tvpog- 
raphy, from fine italicized print to extreme hold-fare, situate the letters of the poem in layers 
of varying depth within the page and at the same time proclaim the mute fact of the word or 
letter as a concrete object stranded in space, hlocked off from the linear flow of the written line. 
In both these forms the word is made into a physical thing (whether pinned to the surface or 
projected into depth). And this tends to strip it of any resonance of associative meaning. Re- 
maining inert like a label, the word literally becomes an object. 

In Mini's art of the twenties, words are never divorced from their meanings. In fact they are 
given d mi hie and sometimes triple associations (like the verb form "baisse" in the painting "&lt; /; 
on, ‚ñ†mi poursuit unr abeille &lt;i la baisse," which is made to read '"lower." "lav and "embrace"). 
Hut unlike Mini's notion of the way words should function within painting, concrete poetry, 
beginning with the Futurism of Marinetti (fig. 8) and continuing through to Dada, forced and 
celebrated a loosening of the ties between words and their meanings. In an ironic jibe at the 
dissociation of concrete poetry. Louis Aragon composed a little work in that genre in 1920:

If neither collate nor concrete poetrv really open onto the special landscape of Mini's achieve- 
ment of the mid-twenties, this is due in part to the distance they enforced hetween language and 
its meaning. Hut it also involves the fact that the word-as-ohject could neither (in collage) 
single-handedly structure a space, nor (in concrete poetrv) achieve a fluidity hetween the word 
and the pictorial meaning of the space it occupied. 

The conceptual distance hetween "I n oiseau poursuit . . ." and Marinetti's Paroles en liberte" 
(Words in Freedom) has to do with Mini's consideration for conventional meanings and his 
sensitivity to the associative flexibility of line. Although concretist poetry does not seem to he 
very surest ive. then, as a source of Mini's use of the sign, there is one work from the pre- 
history of concrete poetrv that is an exception: Christian Mor^enstern's Fishes' Night Song 
i Fig. 9). Hecause that poem resists the obj edification of the letter as such, remaining instead in 
the world ol pre- literate calligraphy, the lines which constitute it retain the character of draw - 
in;,'. Bach unit of the poem possesses the quality of a primilh e sign surfacing from the world of 
resemblance onto the field of representation, able to make the reader acutely conscious of the 
actual act of writing/drawing. Consequently the field of the poem calls several things to mind

at once: the form of the fish ‚Äî in ils shape and symbolization of scales and fins; the shimmering 
ambienl of the animal ‚Äî in ils suggestion of the surface of water; and the linear organization 

of writing on a page (specifically the writing of poetry since the signs Morgenstern uses are the 
signs for metric feet: the iamb and the dactyl). It is this kind of multiplicity due to the pre- 
verhal character of the signs Morgenstern uses that is suggestive for Miro's own work. 

Published in Germany in 1905 as part of the Galgenlieder (or gallows songs), Fishes' Night 
Song almost immediately achieved total currency among literate Europeans. Paul Klee certain- 
ly knew it, and by the late teens and early twenties, Klee's art abounded with pre-verbal signs 
like arrows, dotted spirals and exclamation points. Within the luminous segments of broken 
color which comprised the field of Klee's paintings, these signs operated in an extremely 
pictorial way (fig. 1 1). Establishing directions through the space of the field, they played a role 
in structuring it. Further, Klee integrated the signs within the space of his landscapes, main- 
taining a parity between them and the other graphic elements in the paintings. Suspended mid- 
way between drawing and writing, between deep space and the picture surface, Klee's signs 
were highly suggestive for the way Miro was to develop his own special use of line. 31 Vet Klee 
never risked the openness of the color field that Miro demanded for his own art. nor the use of 
the sign as the total structuring element, nor the possibilities of scale which these two factors 
could combine to produce. 

Indeed, the artifact that most nearly intersected with Miro's own drive for internal openness 
of color and large scale was the backdrop which Picasso produced for the opening act of the 
ballet Mercure in 1924. In December of that year, in the first issue of La Revolution Sur- 
realiste, Max Morise wrote: "A word is written, and it is not far from the idea of a star to the 
word 'star,' to the symbolic sign which the inscription STAR attributes to it. I am thinking of 
the decor by Picasso for Mercure which represented night. In the sky not single star; only the 
written word sparkling there many times. " 32 Picasso's backdrop was a blue ground. At its 
center was a schematic, fine-line rendering of a woman reclining on a dias. On the backdrop 
around her was sprinkled in several places the word "dtoile." (See fig. 12.) By 1924 the Sur- 
realists who hailed Picasso's set as a great innovation 33 had seen a lot of writing in pictorial and 
quasi-pictorial contexts. But the source of the freshness and excitement of Mercure was the way 
the word seemed to be absorbed deep into the visual context as the fleeting and evanescent idea 
of the star, enveloped by, and at the same time creating, the luminous field which it defined. 

31 The most direct connection, between Klee and Miro in 1925 occurs in the painting "Amour" (fig. 17) where 
letters issue from the hole at the lower right of the oval field. The similarity between this and the treat- 
ment in Klee's Order of the High C, 1921 fig. 10). where a letter issues from a point in the lower right 
of the pale oval face is suggestive. The Klee watercolor originally belonged to Paul Eluard who owned 
several Klees in the early 1920s. There is, then, a likelihood that Miro knew this particular work by Klee 
and that it might have affected the composition of "Amour."

In 1925, the year following Picasso's set for Mercure, Miro was to painl a number ol works 
where open grounds were shaped by ihe relationship of visual symbols and writing. "Etoilei en 
des sexes d'escar got" (cat. no. 11) is one of these; 34 another is The Siesta (cat. no. L3); and still 
another is "Sable" (cat. no. 21). In the case of "Sable" Mini identifies cadi of the four quadrants 
of the picture field with a symbol of the four natural elements: a pictographic representation of 
waves for water; a schematic drawing of a tiny boat with an enormous sail lor air: a s\stciii ol 
dotted lines issuing from Miro's symbol of the sun's rays for fire ‚Äî in this case heat; and the 
word "Sable' 7 for the earth or sand. Not only do these pictographs or signs identify the section 
of ground which they seem to stake out in the flat of the picture field, but they also participate 
in a representation of space which is simultaneously ideographic and visual. For each of the four 
elements presents the notion of spatial recession to the eye of the beholder/reader: the three 
converging lines of the sail imply recession into the upper left corner of the painting; the point 
towards which the perforated lines direct themselves implies a movement toward the upper 
right; the parallelism of the sign for waves converges towards the left edge of the canvas; \\ hile 
the letters which inscribe "Sable" onto the field increase in size moving towards the right. In- 
stead of a pictorial field which, like a normal landscape, establishes a single vanishing point. 
Miro constructs a schema for a fan-like perspective, with vanishing points gravitating towards 
each of the picture's four corners. And the effect is to both structure and set into motion I he 
variegated wash of the ground. 

In the mid and late twenties Miro's problem was, then, to invent a kind of drawing that 
would not serve to outline objects. He had to find a way to draw that would serve as ecriture. 
and it is on the deep level of drawing as writing that Miro made his formal connection to 
poetry. 34 " 

By 1925 when Miro had begun his investigations into the relationship between drawing and 
writing, two other painters in the Surrealist orbit had already produced work which made use 
of words. These were Picabia and Max Ernst. Not only had Picabia used lettering to re-enforce 
the weightless, diagrammatic quality of his line in works which he assimilated into the special 
diction of the mechanical drawing (fig. 19), but lie had also employed the symbol of the wheel 
in a way that Miro was to adopt in many of the paintings in the mid and late twenties. 

The iconography of Ernst's Dada collages 30 as well as that of the work he did in conjunction 
with the poet Paul Eluard also seems to have affected .Mini. Not only is there Ernst's image of 
the pierced, disembodied eye (fig. 26) which appeared in 1922 as the first graphic image of 
Eluard' collection of poetry, Repetitions (and which shows up shortly thereafter in 1 be 

34 For discussion, see pp. 57‚Äî8, below. 

31a For the connection between Miro's formal ambitions and bis use of actual poetic content, see pp. 68-9 
below. 

35 Throughout Ernst's collages in the late teens, the wheel is a central image. In addition Ernst's 1920 paint- 
ing Dada-Gauguin contains a strange image of a cactus at its left, which may have affected Miro's own 
cactus image in The Tilled Field (cat. no. 1), as well as a phallic form at the picture's center which shows 
up in Miro's phallic-like designation of the standing figure in works like Drawing fig. 4 .

Hunter)? 6 There is also the isolated ear (later to become so prominently a pari of The Tilled 
Field)? 1 which Ernst first uses in his image for u Le nettoyage des cancan i . . ." (fig. 23) from 
the 1922 edition of Eluard's Les Malheurs des immortels, and which reappears in the frescoes he 
painted for Eluard's house in Eaubonne in 1 922‚Äî 25. 38 

Admiring Eluard as he did, Miro seems to have looked hard at the productions w hi ch emerged 
from the special relationship between Eluard and Ernst. Miro must therefore have been im- 
pressed by the picture-poems which Ernst made in 1924. 39 Yet both Picabia ami Ernst seem to 
have offered catalysts rather than formal precedents. Picabia's lettering has none of the ambigu- 
ity and visual provocativeness of Miro's, since it simply identifies the pictorial field as a 
mechanical diagram. And Ernst's lettering, made to circulate around and through a de Chiri- 
coesque landscape space, is never asked either to structure that space or to make inroads into the 
abstract realm of the sign, which was the shared interest of Miro and Klee. Thus, while Miro 
was certainly not blind to the visual activity, around him, his own explorations were grounded 
in his feelings about the precedence of the pictorial field and the way drawn writing could open 
onto a new understanding of its structure. 

In the 1927 "Beaucoup de monde*' (cat. no. 29) there is once again an equivalence between 
writing, conventional sign systems and the pictograph. Fanning outward and into depth from 
a point at the left side of the field, the space slips from the uncertain foreground of the writing 
past the sign/horizon line of the arrow, into a pictographic statement of depth. A range of 
parallel lines at the top of the painting ‚Äî Miro's sign for clouds ‚Äî is made to work here as an 
emblem of space. 40 Another canvas of 1927 maintains this kind of structure with a vanishing 
point at the left of the painting. Together with a kind of internally projected picture frame, 
the linear elements float like signs of pictorial space within the freedom of an open field ( fig. 14). 
And the magnificent work of 1927 known as The Toreador (cat. no. 51) recapitulates the sign 
system of the Head of a Catalan Peasant, but now incorporates, in the floating rectangle of black, 
a shape which reflects that of the picture field itself onto and into the space of the work. The 
referents of Miro's line are always double in this way ‚Äî signifying a world beyond the painting 
and at the same time involved in a game of self-reference ‚Äî a statement of the exigencies of the 
picture field. 

The limits to which Miro was willing to go, the risks of emptiness and non-signification he 
was willing to take, are stated as early as 1925 in the extraordinary Painting (cat. no. 18) in 
which a field of blue is differentiated only by a slight coagulation or thickening at its center. 
There, the finest breath of a horizontal striation registers both as the horizon line within the 
field and as the central crease in the picture surface. In one stroke, that slash in the blue field

creates the effect of pictorial space (with its possibilities of illusionistic release), and becomes 
in ideogram of its construction. It seems fair to say, given this painting, that by 1925 Mini had 
brought off the most daringly open work of the first quarter of the century, just as he was to 
delight Eluard five years later with producing its nakedest. 41 It was not until the two great 
cycles of murals from 1961 and 191)2 (cat. nos. 39‚Äî44) that Miro was to attempt anything 
quite like it again. 

In a series of twelve landscapes produced in the summer of 1927, Miro explored the potential 
of a more intensely chromatic use of the ground to carry the pic lures' structure. Mini has been 
quoted as saj ing of Matisse that he "taught us all that autonomous color, with or without 
modeling, could carry structure through contrasts and subtle juxtapositions.'" 42 One of these 

I 92 7 landscapes depends for its structure on the absolute chromatic parity between red and blue 
flat fields of color at their maximum intensity (cat. no. 26). In this way the landscape seems to 
in (institute the 1925 Painting (cat. no. f8) by substituting the radiance of flat color for the 
atmospheric gentleness of the earlier picture's ground. 43 It represents an attitude toward color 
and structure to which Miro returned thirty years later in The Lark's fling Encircled with 
Golden Blur . . . (cat. no. 47). 

In the landscape called The GrassJiopper (cat. no. 24). Mini's signature operates on the field 
somewhat in the way it had in "I n oiseau poursuit line abeille . . ." by representing the nature 
of the landscape's terrain. Further, by presenting the letters of his first name, Joan, in splayed 
almost invisible writing. Mini forces the reading of the words to oyerlap the act of looking. For 
reading becomes synonymous with the search, the exploratory piercing of the flat field, that is 
necessary to transform the continuous surface of the yellow ground into the illusionistic depth 
of the pictorial world. 

Mini has said. "The Impressionists realized that the landscape breathes, that it changes from 
one moment to the next‚Äî that under the influence of light every form becomes transparent and 
even shadows are full of life. Nothing has changed, we simply have to see it again, that is to say. 
to find a new form for it." 41 From 1925 to 1927. Minis work can be seen as an unbroken effort 
to find that form, and then in the 1960s to re -find it.

For sonic of the younger artists who saw his painting in the mid and late twenties, Mini's work 
had indeed the force and immediacy of a totally new form. Giacometti, for example, is quoted as 
saying, "For me, it was the great liberty ‚Äî something more aerial, more disengaged, lighter 
than anything I had ever seen ... He was so truly a painter that all he needed was to drop three 
blobs of color on the canvas lor it to exist and he coherent as a painting." '‚Ä¢' Hut while (iiacomelti 
was overw helmed by Mini's gifts as a "pure" painter, Breton, as the chef d'dcole of Surrealism, 
was for his part somewhat dismayed. At the end of the twenties Breton wrote of these works: 

Of the thousands of problems which preoccupy him to no degree at all, even though they are 
the ones which trouble the human spirit, there is only one perhaps towards which Miro has 
any inclination: to abandon himselj to painting, and only to painting, (which is to restrict 
himselj to the one domain in which we nun' be sure he has the means), to give himself over to 
pure automatism about which, for my part. I have never ceased to make an appeal, but o] 
which 1 fear that Miro has too summarily come to the proof of its worth and its deep ratio- 
nale. Perhaps it is true, for that reason that he will pass for the most "surrealist" of us all. 
Hut how jar we are in his work from that ''chemistry of the intellect" of which we had been 
speaking'" "' 

The intellectual chemistry about which Breton had been speaking, on this occasion, was the 
work of Masson, which Breton could read in terms of his own ideas of the symbolism of the 
unconscious. Often taken out of context, the ahoye statement by Breton is made to read as an 
affirmation of Miro as a Surrealist. Vet, just as Breton wasted no time in 1926 criticizing Miro 
(along with Ernst) for haying collaborated with Diaghilev and the Ballets russes in his contri- 
bution to the decor for Romeo et Juliette. 1 ' Breton was unhappy with Mini's painting during 
the 1920s. Hut by 1929-50 Miro had begun work which must have been much more con- 
genial to Breton's sensibility. The series of collages which Miro started at that time and devel- 
oped in the early 1 910s had much more in common with Breton's own tablcaux-poemcs. which 
incorporated found-objects and written phrases onto the surface of a canvas. As well, they were 
more in accord with the elaborate collages Ernst was also doing at the time. The far more 
compact pictorial syntax which increasingly de\ eloped out of these collages had much to do with 
the shaping of Mho's style in the 1950s and in the decades to come. Beaching back to the teem- 
ing imagery of The Harlequin's Carnival, they formed the image of Minis art that is the most 
familiar and by far the most prevalent to the large audience of his work. 

But Miro is not particularly awed by his own image. He has always been extremely open to 
the work of artists less established than himself, and he is legendary in Paris for conscientiously

going lo exhibitions of young painters. Thus in the early 1 950s he saw and was mo\ ed by \\ ork 
of the American abstract-expressionist generation, particularly the paintings of Jackson Pol- 
lock. 48 With the impetus of these painters behind him, Mini returned to the scale he had achiev- 
ed in his great Circus Horse painting of 1927 (cat. no. 54) and lo the structure by means of pure 
color of his 1925 Painting (cat. no. 18). Reconnecting with the sign language of Head o] a 
Catalan Peasant and with the symbol systems of the great works of 1 927. be began work on the 
huge mural cycles which have preoccupied much of his thought during the past decade and on 
which he is still at work. 

The three blue murals of 1961 came first (cat. nos. 59‚Äî41). Then in 19(52 a three -panelled 
mural in yellow-orange, green and red (cat. nos. 42‚Äî44). This was followed by a huge triptych 
in white (which Miro calls Paintings for the Cell of a Solitary Man); and at present he is work- 
ing on a tripartite mural on a black ground. 

The red panel of the multi-colored mural (cat. no. 44) forms a particularly interesting reprise 
of the 1927 Landscape called Rabbit and Flower (cat. no. 26). In the earlier painting Mini had 
held the surface continuous by means of two devices: the equivalence in intensity between its 
red and blue halves; and the use of white silhouettes for its sparse figuration. The "rabbit," due 
to the simplicity of its shape and because of its color (white), reads as a hole or puncture in the 
red field. It therefore seems to open a space backward into the fabric of the ground, in contrast 
to the schematically modeled egg-shape of the "flower." The latter, due to its greater plasticity, 
appears to come forward. These two elements oppose whatever perceptual tendency blue has to 
recede and red to advance. In this way these shapes lock the large, simple planes of the painting 
into an absolute visual equivalence. In most of the other landscapes of this period, w bite figures 
are used for a similar formal task. (See for example. Landscape called The Hare, cat. no. 27. 
and Circus Horse, cat. no. 54). 

In the red panel of 1962, Miro omits the contrast of red and blue, and the white lacunae of 
the "rabbit" and "flower." He retains only the horizon line and the flower's stem ‚Äî both given 
in long, unbroken calligraphs. Yet these two lines function in a way that is close to the operation 
of the early painting. The line of the "stem" both appears behind the ground line and seems to 
be arching over it. The ambiguity of its placement seems to prise apart the absolute continuity 
of the red surface; and to rehearse, within the completely abstract space of this panel, that 
primitive beginning of figure-ground separation that one saw in Head of a Catalan Peasant. 
The act of line triumphing over surface, without interrupting the effulgence of the color, is 
played out with strict economy in all three of the panels for the 1962 mural. 

Elsewhere in the work of the sixties, Miro retains the device of the white shape. But instead 
of using it as a cut or rupture in the surface, he treats it as a kind of halation around the line 
that invades that surface. This is the case in Passage of the Migratory Bird. 1968 (fig. 21) and 



48 Miro claims to have first been impressed by American painting during his stay in New York in 1947. In 
1952 he saw the exhibition of Jackson Pollock's work in Paris at the Studio Paul Facchetti. See Margit

Hair Pursued l&gt;\ Jan Planets, 1968 (rat.no. 52), where in one work a scumbled ground of 
blue and in the oilier oi green create nearly impenetrable fields of color. Onto these grounds 
Mini registers an arbitrary set of marks ‚Äî a black line in Passage oj the Migratory Bird: and in 
Hair Pursued by Two Planets, three linear splashes of orange reaching towards two dots and a 
crooked line halated l&gt;\ yellow -orange. The areas of lightness which open out behind these 
marks simultaneously underscore \ isually and seem to signify the meaning of the pictorial field 
itself: the tenuous grasp it has on its own opacity. For how solid can a surface be when any mark 
which appears upon it will drive it backward into subservience as the background to the marks 
"figure" ? 

The magic of Mini's light halos is thai they dissipate the power of the mark even while they 
refer to it. For the field acknowledges its own identity and then transcends it through the 
medium of color. 

For the most part the field paintings of the 1960s refrain from using line as actual writing. 
Hut the calligraphic quality of Mir6's line and the formal meanings he demanded that that line 
carry are retained. In a single gesture it lays down the artists response to things in the natural 
world and to the act of inscribing the canvas. Functioning as the unsilvered mirror, the color 
I ield is held up to the viewer as the medium which connects the presence of a world beyond the 
painting with this consciousness of the artist who marks its surface. 

If there is a magic in Mini's use of signs in the work of the 1920s and the 1960s ‚Äî in the 
group of paintings collected here as ''magnetic fields" ‚Äî it is powerfully a formal magic. Mini 
himself suggests this when he says. ''Poetry, plastically expressed, speaks its own language." 19

Joan Mm6 

Many paintings executed by Joan Miro between 1924 and 1927 are broad and loosely brushed 
fields of color animated by enigmatic signs. Because of their radical departure from the artist's 
earlier work, and because of his affiliations at that time, these paintings are generally identified 
with Miro's "official" Surrealist period and defined as peinture-poisie) One of the more con- 
vincing analyses of these paintings relates them to the Surrealist practice of automatism. 
Furthermore according to Miro himself, hallucinations and dreams supplied some of the fun- 
damental imagery which he subsequently elaborated into coherent pictorial form. 

Despite their anomalous quality ‚Äî or perhaps because of it ‚Äî these paintings by Miro are 
among the most important works of his career. They are the seed from which his total oeuvre of 
the next four decades was to flower. The Tilled Field (cat. no. 1) ‚Äî begun in the summer of 1 923 
in Montroig and finished in Paris during the winter of 1925-24 ‚Äî is generally regarded as the 
transitional work: the first painting in Miro's new poetic style. Yet the iconography of The 
Tilled Field has never been clear, no more so than the reasons for this departure from an earlier 
style. If one compares this painting to The Farm, painted two years earlier and ostensibly from 
the same source of inspiration (Miro's family farm in Montroig), many questions remain un- 
answered. Although the familiar barnyard animals are depicted in both, in the later painting 
they are endowed with a supernatural quality. The goat feeding on a cactus in the upper left is 
scarcely recognizable. The lizard in the lower right ‚Äî an infinitesimal detail in 1 he F arm ‚Äî 
has been transformed into a mythical creature whose importance is central to the whole coin- 
position; it is as though he has cast an enchanted spell. 

Miro's visual sources up to that period are well known. 2 Yet they throw limited light on the 
metamorphosis from the mundane to the magical which quite suddenly takes place. This is 
reason enough to explore another important facet of Miro's activity: namely, the poetry he was 
reading and the poets he was seeing. The artist's biographers are careful to mention that his 
friends in Paris in the twenties were as much poets as painters. Miro has repeatedly confirmed 
this himself. And his friendship with the painter Andre Masson was meaningful to him on more 
than purely artistic grounds : 3

order" as distinguished from "peinture-pure, or peinture-peinture by which advanced abstraction was

Pavd Klee.

Wasson was always a great reader and full of ideas. Among his friends were practically all 
the young poets of the day. Through Masson I met them. Through them I heard poetry dis- 
cussed. J'/ie poets Masson introduced me to interest,// me more than the painters I had met 
in Pans. I was carried away by the new ideas they brought and especially the poetry they 
discussed. I gorged mysel] on it all night long ‚Äî poetry principally in the tradition of Jarry's 
Surma k'. 1 

Andre Masson lias recently described certain bases of their friendship in the following terms: 

// was obvious that for Mird as for myself, poetry (in the broadest sense of the term) was of 
capital importance. Our ambition was to be a painter-poet and in that we differed from our 
immediate predecessors who. while going around with the poets of their generation, were 
terrified of being labelled "literary painters." As painters purporting to work from poetic 
necessity, ire were taking a great risk. Furthermore, but for a few rare exceptions, the verdict 
of the French critics observing our beginnings was: "Definition of a Surrealist painter: not 
a painter but a failed poet." This was in the best of cases. Often we were charitably advised 
to "go and have your heads examined" . . . As for written poetry, although Joan divulged little 
about his interests licre as elsewhere, I can say that he loved the same symbolist poets as the 
rest of us: Jarry, Laut reunion! . Rimbaud. Mallarme . . . He never offered details about the 
inspirational origins of his paintings. This was distasteful to him. which makes the job of 
real criticism all the more difficult :' 

Although much of Mini's public endorses his myth as the child-like, spontaneous and non- 
literary painter par excellence, there is documentation which contradicts this image. Prior 
to his arrival in Paris in 1919‚Äî1920, Mini had tome in contact with the Dada movement 
in Barcelona, through French and Spanish periodicals and somewhat later through Picabia. The 
list of avail! -garde magazines which were founded in the teens and available to Mini in Barce- 
lona is impressive, from the French publications Les Soirees de Paris. SIC. Xord-Sud, Littera- 
ture. 2 l&gt; I and 391 6 to the Catalan magazines Trossos, La Revista. Til i non and the Franco- 
( latalan bi-monthly //. I via/ or L'Instant, for which Miro did a poster in 191 9. It is interesting 
to Dote l lie currenl of ideas passing between Paris and Barcelona at that time. The Spanish poets 
Perez-Jorba, Huidobro, J. V. Foix, J.M. Junoy were writing Spanish calligrammcs shortly 
after Apollinaires first appeared in Les Soirees de Paris in 1914; these poets were publishing in 
the Paris-based review SIC as early as 1918. Significantly. Mini's acquaintance with Dada was 
primarily literary. 

i James Johnson Sweeney, "Joan Mini: Comment ami Interview, " Partisan Review, vol. XV, no. 2, February 
1948, p. 209. li is interesting to note Mini's crediting Masson with his introduction to poetry, when, ac- 
cording to Masson in conversation with the authors in June 1972 . Miro was already immersed in poetry 
before the t w o even met. 

5 I ,etter dated April 19, 1972, from Andre Masson to the authors. 

6 J91 was in fact first published by Picabia in Barcelona through the Galerie Dalmau' in 1917, although it 

was later to he published in Paris. 
H) 



Furthermore, the artist's long-time friend James Johnson Sweeney, who accompanied him to 
Surrealist reunions in the twenties, confirms Mini's interest in poetry and poetics In an eye- 
witness account : 

Mud sat through tliese meetings as though hypnotized. He was genuinely fascinated bj the 

discussions of poetic techniques and practices w/iic/i were devised to suspend the powers o] 
reason. T/ie objective of course was to liberate form and meaning in the interests o] "pure 

poetry." 1 

These and other accounts by Miro's friends, biographers and Mini himself provide evidence 
that Miro's interest in literature and particularly in poetry was more than peripheral. The task 
at hand is to discover how poetry could have influenced his work il in fad it did. Whether 
Miro's inspiration sprang from his subconscious or his conscious mind appears to be of secondary 
importance here. Primary to the understanding of Miro's oeuvre is the fact that during the 
early to mid twenties, his imagination was nourished by poetry. ,a The years 1 923 to 1 924 mark 
the turning point: from an artist who was seeking his personal style, he became an artist who 
had found it. The shock which produced the transition from one to the other was poetry. 



At least one painting from this period shows explicit inspiration from a literary source: Portrait 
of Madame B. of 1924 (cat. no. 4). The reference is Alfred Jarry's play Ubu Roi. Miro lias 
himself confirmed that Jarry, whom he discovered at that time, was one of his preferred 
authors. But more important, the artist's images and references to the text are literal and 
identifiable. 

One of the singularities of Ubu Roi is that it was illustrated ‚Äî although sparsely ‚Äî by Jarrj 
himself. His illustrations depict the hero "Pere Ubu" as a short barrel-shaped character whose 
distinguishing features are a dunce-cap and an enormous spiral (known as "La Gidouille") in- 
scribed upon his stomach, suggestive of his predominantly intestinal functions (see fig. 1 5). 

In Miro's Portrait of Madame B., the general silhouette of the figure on the left is too partic- 
ularized to refer to anyone but Pere Ubu. Moreover critics writing when Ubu Roi was first 
produced 8 refer to Pere Ubu's pig-like snout. 9 Once this figure's identity is established, the rest 
of the iconography is easily legible, derived directly from passages in the text. The central 
figure is "Mere Ubu,'" holding the scepter and crown of the king of Poland. (Mere Ubu to Pere 

1 In conversation with the authors, April 1972. 

"a Poetry has been a lifetime preoccupation for Miro. However it seems to the author that the identity of 
literary and pictorial images occurs particularly during this period. 

8 Presented as a play for marionettes in 1888, Uba Roi was first produced on the stage at the Theatre de 
l'Oeuvre (M. Lugne-Poe) in December 1896. 

9 At Jarry's suggestion, the principal character wore a mask in the theatrical production.

Ubu: "Yes, and as soon as he is dead, you will lake his scepter and his crown.'") 1 " The image in 
the upper right is a parody of the Polish coat of arms ‚Äî an heraldic eagle with outspread wings 

which the legitimate queen of Poland sees in a dream (the Queen to the King: " . . .didn't 1 see 
him in a dream smiting you with his troops and throwing you in the Vistula, and an eagle like 
that on the arms of Poland setting the crown on his head'.'"] 11 On the far left, the green serpen- 
tine form is Pere Ubu's green candle, by which he swears throughout the play (l'ere Ubu : "By 
my green candle, . . .") 12 One of Jarry's drollest inventions in this play is the "machine a 
decerveler" or "debraining machine" to which Ubu submits his nobles and ministers. The dark 
wisps emerging from the head of Miro's Mere Ubu and from that of his eagle are obvious 
indications of "debraining." 

Finally, the letters: IMRA, affixed to the crown held by Mere Ubu, stimulate a number of 
possible readings. The most prominent and first that comes to mind is Miro's name or signature. 
However, once the letters are unscrambled, they spell MIRA. A second reading is the French 
abbreviation for English royalty: SMRA (Sa Majeste la Reine d'Angleterre) 11 Thus Miro has 
devised an equivocal contraction suggesting two if not more possibilities, but imposing no 
"correct" reading. This is the first picture in which the artist uses the poetic device of scrambled 
letters in order to expand possibilities of interpretation. It is not the last, as we shall sub- 
sequently observe. 

Portrait of Madame B. is an unusually literal image; compared to most of Mini's paintings 
of that period, its iconography is exceptionally clear. In U Addition of 1925 (cat. no. 1 6), which 
offers another example of Jarry-inspired imagery, the references to the text are less direct. But 
by this very indirection, L 'Addition offers a more characteristic example of the kind of cor- 
respondence one can find between Miro's paintings and his reading. 

Like Portrait of Madame B., LAddition 15 is a complex image derived from disparate visual 
and poetic sources. In Portrait of Madame B., one can analyze the sources as follows: a visual 
image (Jarry's drawings for Ubu Roi), verbal images (explicit passages in the text), and a poetic 
device (the scrambled letters and meanings of IMRA). In LAddition the sources are similarly 
both visual and verbal, but the artist's reference to them is more diffuse. 



10 "Oui, et des (ju'il sera mort tu prenclras son sceptre et sa couronne." Alfred .Tarry, Ubu Roi. Fasquelle 
Editeurs, Paris. 1959. pp. 50-51.

12 "De par ma chandelle verte, . . ." Ibid., p. 77. 

13 "Miro" and "mira" are two tenses of the same verb in Spanish: "mirar": to look at. "Mira" is the third 
person singular present tense or the imperative; "miro" is the third person singular perfect tense. So that 
another interpretation is "Mira !" or "Look !" 

It Another obvious reading, but one which I think can be dismissed in this context, is IXRI Jesus of Naza- 
reth, King of the Jews . 

15 The title is misleading both in French and English English translation: The Clicck . As is the case of most 
of the paintings in this period, Miro's title was simply Pcinture or Painting.

In the May 1 5, 1914 issue of Les Soiries de Paris. 16 Apollinaire published a photograph ol 
"Two views of the original marionette for Ubu Roi." The marionette is shown twice in profile 
and. although the photograph is poor, one can describe the hack contour of the head as resem- 
bling a dried bean, whereas the front profile is distinguished by a receding forehead, a large 
protruding nose and no chin. This essentially grotesque head is mounted on a stick which dis- 
appears into a formless garment or cloak. The figure is completed by arms, hands, ankles and 
Feet, the w hole strung up as befits a marionette. (See fig. 16) 

Hetw ecu Jarry's bean-shaped bead ‚Äî which is attached as though skew : ered to the marionette's 
neck and the heads drawn in profile in Mini's L' Addition, the resemblance seems too close to 
be a case of mere coincidence. 1 " furthermore, other sources for this droll, bean-shaped profile 
would be difficult to find. Even the Catalan toys which are well-known sources of some of 
Miro's forms do not present these specific characteristics. Accepting Jarry's marionettes as one 
source of Miro's imagery in 1925, one might speculate that the prevailing weightlessness of 
Miro's figures of this period, as well as the "stringing together" of otherwise isolated motifs, 
uu cs something to the idea of the marionette. 

Once again, when we have discovered what seems to be an important visual clue to the 
[tainting, literary allusions to Jarry are easier to recognize. Miro has referred repeatedly to the 
enormous impression Jarry's Le Surmdle had upon him and it is this text that has inspired the 
imagery of the painting. As the story opens, the hero Marcueil ‚Äî the surmdle or "super- 
male"' ‚Äî asserts that a man can make love an infinite number of times. Challenged on this 
claim, he proceeds later in the story to do so eighty-two consecutive times. In order to perform 
this feat, he disguises himself as an Indian, not wanting to reveal his identity to those who have 
been summoned to witness the event. 

L'Addition may be seen as an illustration of the text recalled from memory. One remembers 
that Marcueil painted and powdered bis body to resemble an Indian, a disguise which may even 
have included a feather headdress. Of course, he was endowed with a superhuman phallus. 
Ellen, bis partner, was white -skinned. She wore a mask until the end of the performance, when 
the mask fell away showing eyes circled with exhaustion. At a certain point in the narration, the 
lovers ate and drank together and she kissed his body all over, leaving multicolored imprints. At 
another point, she arose to put balm on herself: and at the conclusion of the experience, her body 
appeared as on the verge of decomposition. 18 Ellen's intimate state is illustrated by the artist by 
the doited line of a dilated vagina as opposed to its original firm red state. The return to form- 
lessness is suggested by the line of the white figure's body meandering to the upper right corner

of the canvas. The column of numbers next to it refers to the counting of Marcueil's perform- 
ances, and the circular motif in the mid left-hand area is the peep-hole through which the 
scientist Dr. Bathybius is observing the experiment, complete with the dotted vectors ol his 
seeing eye. 

Some of the motifs depicted in the painting are not, in fact, in the text, but are extrapolated 
in Miro's imagination. 19 It is obviously not the particular images of the story so much as his 
recollections of it which Miro has freely interpreted here. 

The two examples from Jarry present evidence that Miro's imagination was stimulated by 
specific literary works. 20 Although they are exemplary, they are not unique in Miro's produc- 
tion between 1924 and 1927. Poetic images and techniques adapted from literary sources occur 
with enough frequency to justify considering them extremely important to the understanding 
of the artist's private iconography in this period. 



There appear to be essentially four ways in which Miro's painting of 1 924 to I 92 7 was affected 
by poetry. The first ‚Äî and perhaps most common ‚Äî was that he absorbed and mentally elaborat- 
ed poetic images which he subsequently projected in visual form; the two paintings we have 
looked at contain examples of this. A second type of influence from poetry is instanced in Miro s 
tableaux- poemes ; 21 where Miro adapted an equally vivid verbal image in word form on the 
canvas, free from actual literary reference, but nonetheless evoking in the viewer's mind a 
similar range of imaginary and non-depicted connotations as the poetry he was reading. Still 
another aspect of Miro's involvement with poetry lies in his adaptation of poetic de\ ices in the 
elaboration of a tableau -poeme-. devices such as the scrambling of letters, alliteration, syntactic 
inversion, homonyms. His broadest debt to poetry is in the general metaphysical meaning and 
poetic conventions prevalent among the forerunners of Surrealism as well as among his con- 
temporaries. 

An early example of the first type ‚Äî where a pictorial image contains references to specific 
poetic imagery ‚Äî is found in "Sourire de ma blonde" (cat. no. 5) of 1 924. The title alludes to the 
popular French song "Aupres de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon dormir." Miro executed several 

19 Marcueil's coloring is unmistakably a copper-red and there is no mention of a feather headdress. Although 
Ellen does arise to put balm on herself, there is no reference to her intimate state, although one imagines 
what it might be. And although after eating pastries, she does kiss her lover all over his body, she does not 
leave colored marks but spots of sugar. 

20 Another painting of 1925 which probably draws its inspiration from Jarry is Painting The Candle 
(D. 150) in which can be seen a crown suspended on a string, and a candle t'bu's marionette's crown and 
his green candle). 

21 Tableau-poeme : picture-poem, where words are inserted in the field of the canvas. In a discussion of Max 
Ernst's tableaux-poemes of 1924, William Rubin has commented that "the words are syntactically re- 
lated and, like the images they replace, are primary rather than secondary in determining the design of 
the picture." William Rubin, op. cit., p. 146.

drawings and paintings during this period in which he made indirect references to this theme. 

"Sourire de ma blonde" is organized as an heraldic image, with a studied symmetry and 
frontality which are rare, not to say unique, in Mini's oenvre. 23 However, despite the clarity of 
its presentation, the reading of the image is highly ambiguous. 

One possible reading identities the central image as a piclogram of the blond loved-one's 
body, in which the Y-shaped torso has obvious sexual connotations. Starting from there, one 
can read the brown scumbled area as a mass of pubic hair, the flower as a reference to the 
fragrance 1 of flowers, the grapes as an allusion lo romantic intoxication, and the fly as a Rim- 
baldian symbol to which we will return later. The artist's image of ideal womanhood is thus 
schematically rendered as female genitalia, grounded in the earth (through the OUtsized arms 
and legs' and sprouting long tendrils of hair. Isolated motifs and symbols associated with erotic 
love radiate around the central figure: an ear. a shooting star leaving a trail of sparks, teeth. 
an eye, an idealized profile, hair, a throbbing or flaming n agina. breasts. 

The looscd\ symmetrically disposition of the "spokes" of the woman's hair implies another 
meaning: woman as the matrix of the world, or the hub of the uni\ erse. as in the sun. This in no 
way obviates another reading, more peculiar lo Mini's private iconography, according to which

I 6 



The idea of the heraldic emblem or blason of womanhood is common in Surrealist literature, 
particularly in Surrealist poetry. The most celebrated precedent is Arthur Rimbaud's sonnet: 
"Voyelles" of 1871. In a highly esoteric presentation, the poet evokes the different sexual 
attributes of the female body, associating each to a color and a vowel: tbe genitals correspond 
to A and black; the breasts to E and white; the lips to I and red; the hair to U and green 
(associated with the waves of the sea); the eyes correspond to O and blue. Each sexual attribute 
is implied (without being named) by a series of recondite metaphors. 

One can recognize all the attributes in Rimbaud's literary emblem in Miro's painting, trans- 
lated into the artist's personal idiom, of course. However, the closest correspondence between 
Miro's imagery and that of Rimbaud is found in relation to the poet's first stanza, devoted I" 
the letter A: 

A, noir corset velu des mouches eclat antes 
Qui bombinent autour des puanteurs cruelles, 
Golfes d' ombre; . . , 25 

A, black corset hairy with the glittering flies 
That buzz around cruel stench, 
Gulfs of darkness ; . . . 

From the V-shaped torso (an overturned A?) 26 inscribed by a black line, to the imaging of a 
fly and what can be read as a "gulf of darkness," there is reason to conjecture that Miro may 
have been drawing inspiration from Rimbaud. We know that Miro had read Rimbaud by that 
time. 27 "Voyelles," as one of the Surrealists' preferred poems, was certainly one of the earliest of 
the poet's works which Miro would have read. 

In a painting of two years later ‚Äî "Amour" of 1926 (fig. 17) ‚Äî one finds what appears to be 
further evidence for Miro's attachment to this sonnet. In "Sourire de ma blonde," the reference 
to the poem is broad. Although the relationship is conjectural, it is entirely in keeping with the 
Surrealists' propensity for the codification of esoteric sign-to-meaning relationships, and visual 
punning. In "Amour," on the contrary, the initial of the title word is constituted by an image 
of buzzing flies around a black spot ; a depiction which is identifiable as a sexual orifice. 

Whether or not Rimbaud's poem was the precise source of inspiration for Miro's "Sourire de 
ma blonde." the painting is definitely an heraldic emblem of womanhood. Another literary 
example of a blason of an ideal woman is found in a poem of 1912 by Rlaise Cendrars: 

25 Wallace Fowlie (translation, introduction, and notes by), Rimbaud, Cojnplete Works, Selected Letters, The 
University of Chicago Press, 1970, p. 120. 

26 See R[ene] F[aurisson], "A-t-on lu Rimbaud?," Bizarre, nos. 21-22. 1961, pp. 5-6. 

2" All of Miro's biographers stress Miro's interest in Rimbaud which dates from this period. Furthermore in 
a recent conversation with the authors (January 1972), Miro emphasized Rimbaud's importance.

The Wheel 

A woman rose up, naked, dazzling, dressed in nothing but her hair. Her radiance proceeded 
not from the beauty of her form, but from within. It was internal, as if, through flesh it self, 
another body shone forth, intermittently, through a gap: ideal! The internal Nude. 
She was not smiling; not even thinking. Her eyes were veiled by her hair. She shed light. She 
rose up, immense as the womb of the world, the Matrix. 

Around her, clouds gathered, leaden, threatening, shaken occasionally by dull shocks, dizzy- 
ing collisions. 

Suddenly a terrible storm exploded. The clouds dissolved in the echoing roar of thousands of 
thunderbolts. And lightning flashes spurted ‚Äî spurted toward the Woman. 
These flashes were hands. And the Woman seemed to be in mid-air, in a circle of hands. All 
t/iese hands surrounded her, stretched toward her! The bony hands of the artist, the moist 
hands of the banker, the clutching hands of the miser, and the swollen hands of the dying; 
the timid hands of the adolescent, the adoring hands of the priest, and the murderer's sacri- 
legious hands. The hands of all men, of all the generations of men, stretched desperately 
toward the Woman, the Whore. The hands, too, the stricken hands of Christ. 
She said nothing. She was at the hub; all rays converged upon her from the rim of the world. 
The wheel turned, swept on through the night, striking sparks from universe to universe, as 
though from cobblestones ; the rays of light writhed like lightning flashes, and the Woman 
hung there, impassive, within that pale orb of amber, at the center of that whirlwind of 
desires stretching to infinity. 

Then I realized that this woman was You, girdled with the despairing madness of all men. 
You, O Beloved, whom I nail, implacable, to the twisted tree of my desire. 

(translation by Richard Howard)

Although it would be difficult to prove what Miro was reading specifically, such imagery 
\\ as certainly present in his mind. 

The suci ess of Mini's painting "Sour in- de ma blonde" lies in its extreme equivocation, which 

applies c\en to the exact "reading" of the title. II the above interpretation of the image is 
correct- that is. that it constitutes a symbolic 'and sexually overpowering) schema ol woman- 
hood then the title is an ironic euphemism. "The smile of my blond" is to he read as "the 
inviting genitals of my blond loved one." a "smile" connoting openness and hospitality as does 
the open "/ " configuration of the central image. 

The relationship of the title to the iconography is not the last enigma inherent in the paint- 
ing. The title itself, on the basis of its \isual aberrations, raises many unanswered questions. 
The concerted breaking of "sou-rire," by means of two distinct styles of lettering, creates a pun : 
"Sous-rire" or "under-laugh," a pun w hich in its erotic connotations runs parallel to the icono- 
graphy. The emphasis on the central portion of the title sets it off from the rest, encouraging 
one to read "KM. IBI." which is phonetically "aimable." This is in keeping with the homonvmic 
practices particularly favored by both Marcel Duchamp and the Surrealist poet Robert Desnos. 
On the basis of these graphic indications, if we break down the title and read it phonetically, we 
arrive at "Sous-rire d' aimable onde" ("smile of a pleasant wave"). Although "onde" or "wave" 
can he translated in reference to various symbolic contexts, for the Symbolist and Surrealist 
poets, it is generally feminine and erotic in its allusions, through the association with (waves of) 
hair or with the sea {la mer : la mire). All these symbolic referents were in fact compacted by 
Rimbaud in the stanza devoted to &lt; in "Voyelles." 

Common Surrealist symbolism and conventions provide the broadest general frame of 
reference to which we may relate Mini's pictorial inspiration during this period. It is within 
these parameters that we have analyzed "Sourire de ma blonde." However there are instances 
where the artist's imagery corresponds so closely to the poetic images in a specific poem as to 
give the impression that the painter was unconsciously illustrating that poem. In this context, 
a comparison of Mini's painting of 192"): "l.e corps de ma brune" (cat. no. 1 5) to a poem by 
Saint-Pol-Roux: "I.es Deux serpents qui burent trop de lait" is enlightening.

According to the poem, a lover in a darkened room has a nightmare in which two unidenti- 
fiable white forms appear before him. These two opaque white presences and their interpreta- 
tions in the poem correspond to the two white forms in Mho's painting: two moon beams, two 
tears of snow, two branches of hawthorn, two necks of swans, two snakes having drunk too 
much milk. At a climax of hallucination, the lover sees the two while forms leap to his loved 
one's throat 30 and loop their tails around her shoulders. This is the passage illustrated in Miro's 
image. In the final stanzas, the lover imagines the forms tightening around his neck like a 
noose only to realize, upon awakening, that they are the loved one's arms embracing him. 

Although Miro's friends and biographers concur that Miro rarely attended Surrealist 
"events," he did attend the Surrealists' banquet in honor of Saint-Pol-Roux, held in 1925 in 
Paris. 31 This was an exceptional occurrence, and Miro has admitted he knew and admired the 
older poet's work. Furthermore, in "Les Deux serpents qui burent trop de lait," the loved one 
is addressed as "ma brune amante," which increases the probability of this poetic source. 

Generally speaking, Miro's paintings drew simultaneously on several sources and u Le corps 
de ma brune'''' is no exception. Superimposed on Miro's painted image is an inscription which, 
particularly in the phrase "comme ma chatte habillee en vert salade, comme de la grele, c'est 
pareil," contains allusions to other poetic sources which we will examine now. 

In shifting our attention from Miro's imagery and its possible literary sources to the artist's 
poetic inscriptions, we are led to consider the second manner in which Miro drew inspiration 
from poetry: starting from a poetic image, Miro invented equally vivid verbal imagery evoking 
a similar range of connotations. The poetic similes for the loved one (roughly translated: "like 
my pussy cat 32 dressed in salad green, 33 like hail, it's all the same") is usually interpreted as an 
automatist poem. However, referents for this poetic imagery exist, one of which is found in a 
work by Guillaume Apollinaire, a poet Miro knew well. The passage occurs in Apollinaire's 
earliest work, L'Enchanteur poumssant : 34 

30 The French word gorge means "throat" in this context. It also means "breasts" which is meaningful in 
relation to Miro's iconography. 

31 Edouard Roditi, "Interview with Joan Miro," Arts, vol. 33, no. 1, October 1958, p. 4"). Roland Penrose 
records Miro speaking of Saint-Pol-Roux in the following passage: " '1 work better when I'm not working 
than when I am,' he told me, 'like Saint-Pol-Roux who used to put a notice outside the door, le poete 
travaille ('The Poet works') when he intended to sleep." " Roland Penrose. Miro, Thames and Hudson. 
London, 1970, p. 170. 

32 The French word chatte has the same literal and figurative meaning as the English "pussy." 

33 In French usage, vert salade ("salad green") is a common painters's term comparable to "apple green" 
or "bottle green" in English. 

34 UEnchanteur pourrissant was first published in book form by Henri Kalmweiler in 1909 with illustrations 
by Andre Derain. It was pre-published in the March-August 1904 issues of the magazine Le Festin 
d'Esope. It was reprinted in 1921 by the Editions de la NRF. Andre Breton considered UEnchanteur 
pourrissant one of Apollinaire's most remarkable achievements see Guillaume Apollinaire, L'Enchanteur 
pourrissarrt, Gallimard, Paris, 1972, Introduction, p. 10). According to Anna Balakian, Breton "identified 
intimately with the image Apollinaire created of the poet, and with the effort to reawaken the magician 
in the 20th century." (Anna Balakian, Andre Breton. Oxford University Press. New York, 1971. p. 23)

Puis ay ant cessi de rire elle built a en s'itirant comme une chatte perfide . . . S'dtant devetue

plein de fruits murs, ronds et appitissants, comme la plaine &lt;lr Janvier, blanche et froide. 

Then, having stopped laughing, she yawned, stretching like an unfaithful pussy . . . Having 
undressed, she admired herself. She was like an April garden, where here and there groic 

clumps of parsley and fennel, like a fores! in June, luxuriant and lyrical, like an October 
orchard, bursting with ripe, round and appetizing fruit . like a plain in January, white and 
add. 

The Likening of the lady to a pussy cat, closely followed by her comparison to an April 
garden, where here and there grow clumps of parsley and fennel (salad greens)' 5, and to a plain 
in January, cold and white, seems too close ‚Äî in both the specificity and the sequence of the 
images ‚Äî to be purely coincidental. Further cross-references, parallel images or "rhymes" 
between Mini's visual configurations and Apollinaire's poetic images reinforce the plausibility 
of a connection between the two: the flowing white forms also evoke "chevelue et lyrique:" the 
lull roundness of the two pairs of breasts provokes a response similar to that of "fruits murs, 
ronds et appitissants." 

In "/.c corps de ma brune," the forms came first, inspired directly or indirectly by Saint - 
Pol-Roux's poem. The text was inscribed afterwards, inspired by the Apollinaire passage and a 
felt necessity to enrich or "illustrate" the painting in both visual and evocative terms. 

Clearly, knowledge of any supporting texts, in this case as in the others, in no way modifies 
the paintings which exist as visually resolved, self-contained wholes. The inscriptions do not 
explain the imagery: they "illustrate" it, as Mini has said, thereby expanding its evocative 
power. The beauty and complexity of these paintings lies in the juxtaposition of essentially 
autonomous systems of signs which, in a curious way. "rhyme."" It is a measure of Minis genius 
to have molded such disparate connotati\e materials into a visually coherent whole. 

Guillaume Apollinaire was one of the Surrealists" more revered heroes. Apollinaire's 
calligrammes, for which he is justly venerated, are an extreme example of the poet's disrespect 
for traditional syntactical form. Through his linguistic manipulation, he generated pristine 
images of stunning immediacy. Apollinaire's mischievous bantering humor, his boundless irra- 
tional insights and richly evocative language provided infinite sources of inspiration to he 
draw n on by subsequent generations. 

35 Vpollinaire, op. tic. p. 22~&gt;. This first line appeared only in the 1904 pre-publication version of the piece. 
It was omitted from subsequent versions. However there is reason to believe thai the first version was 
known in Surrealist circles.

37 The image of "salad greens," through the artist's free association, has been transformed into "salad green."

Apollinaire was probably Miro's broadest source of inspiration during this period. As an 
essentially visual, tactile sensibility, Miro's understanding of Apollinaire's calligramm.es was 
not analytical but intuitive. Thus he applied what he understood with complete freedom, and 
was bound to no theoretical premises. 

For Miro, the visual aspect of words ‚Äî their graphic peculiarities and their arrangement ‚Äî is 
as important as their content. Roland Penrose has suggested that this interest in words and 
writing is a Catalan idiosyncracy. 39 Miro may in fact have derived the idea of introducing 
words into painting from Picabia (see fig. 19). However, the emphasis on words as autonomous 
pictorial entities is missing from the latter's work. Picabia's words generally qualify the images, 
thereby acting as captions. The way they look is secondary to what they say. One can therefore 
infer that Picabia's goal was an intellectual rather than a visual enrichment of the image. 

The key to Miro's painting of this period and the key to his interest in Apollinaire is some- 
thing alluded to briefly before: an idea of parallel poetry or "rhyme" between a poetic and a 
pictorial image. In opposition to the literary tradition of the calligramme, Miro generally 
avoided exact replications between pictorial and poetic imagery. Miro's "rhymes" are abstract, 
based on two images in different mediums which function independently of one another. This 
is illustrated by "Le corps de ma brunch However, the unity of each painting comes from an 
essential similarity and simultaneity of meaning between the two. Another example of this in 
its simplest form is the painting "Oh! un de ces messieurs qui a fait tout ca" (cat. no. 12); while 
the verbal image is an exclamation, the visual image evokes exclamation through its cursive, 
impulsive, eruptive signs. Miro rarely, if ever, juxtaposed incompatible realities as Magrilte 
was to do at a slightly later period. 40 

It is impossible to discuss Miro's involvement with the poets without evoking the name of 
Robert Desnos, one of Miro's closest and dearest friends. Like his Surrealist colleagues, Desnos 
was obsessed by language as a visual, phonetic, signifying material to be manipulated with 
complete freedom. More excessively than any of his contemporaries, he subjected it to bound- 
less, reckless, outrageous experimentation. The goal was not to shock but to perturb logical 
reasoning; to free words and in so doing, to free the mind from conventional order. In the 
process, of course, dreams, images, emotions, and subconscious desires were released. 

Sometime around 1922, in order to unlock the unknown reaches of the mind, Desnos in- 
dulged in daily sessions of hypnosis along with Breton and Soupault and other poets. This period 
is known as "Vepoque des sommeils" or the "era of sleeps." Desnos admitted throughout his 
lifetime that the basis of his poetic imagery came from hypnosis and sleep, or more exactly from 
hallucinations and dreams. Although this helps to explain the vertiginous fancies of his imagi- 
nation, it does not define the full range of his genius, in which formal invention and stylistic 
coherence were very real concerns. 

39 See discussion, cat. no. 14. 

40 More exactly, Magritte juxtaposed words and images which appear at first glance to be widely separate real- 
ities (like Lautreamont's legendary coupling of an umbrella and a sewing machine on a dissecting table . 
Miro did not seek to shock, and in a recent conversation with the authors, he confirmed that this was so.

What distinguishes Desnos' poetry from that of most of the Surrealist poets is an ardent, al- 
most shamelessly romantic lyricism, an authentic emotional intensity, and ‚Äî in most cases ‚Äî a 
fanciful, light-hearted humor. Desnos considered poetry to he an act of love to which the poet 
abandons himself "corps et biens" (body and soul) as in a total embrace. Miro has made a 
similar statement: "Ce qui compte, c'est de mettre notre ame a nu. Peinture ou poesie se font 
comme on fait l'amour; un echange de sang, une etreinte totale, sans aucune prudence, sans 
nulle protection.'" 41 One can understand the basis on which such strong bonds of friendship were 
formed between these two men. 

Two of Miro's tableaux- poemes: "Etoiles en des sexes d'escargot" (cat. no. 11) and "Un 
oiseau poursuit une abeille et la baisse" (cat. no. 25) show the specific influence of Desnos. 

The highly poetic and equivocal phrase and image " etoU.es en des sexes d'escargot" (literally: 
stars in the form of snails' genitals) is arrived at through the application of two linguistic de- 
vices found repeatedly in Desnos' poetry. The first, which was shared by other Surrealist poets, 
is that of alliteration. Desnos exploited alliteration almost to the point of abuse in a collection 
of poems called Langage cult of 1923. The poem "Elegant cantique de Salome Salomon" is an 
excellent example, in which the first stanza reads : 

Mon mal meurt mais mes mains miment 
Noeuds, nerfs non anneaux. Nul nord 
Meme amour mol? mames, mord 
Nus nines nonne ni Nine. 42 

Miro's inscription "etoiles en des sexes d'escargot" appeals to the reader more through a re- 
currence of visual units than through the phonetic impact which was crucially important to 
Desnos. Furthermore, Miro's variant is visually more subtle than it appears at first, in that it 
is not merely based on a recurrent e but on a recurrent unit es and its reversed form se. The 
accent aigu of etoiles denotes the etymologically earlier existence of an 5 (from the Latin 
stella which generated the Spanish estrella and the French Provencal estela). What the eves 
read (with the aid of the subconscious mind) is "e(s)to\\es en Acs sexes d'escargot." The to 
occuring at the beginning of the phrase and the ot at the end are of additional visual importance. 

Although the recurrent signs discussed above are visually available and present a "rhyme" 
to the viewer's retina, any attempt to conjure up a mental image through what appears as a 
poetic simile is thwarted. Whereas the inscription in " I.c corps de ma brune" arouses multiple 

-U ''The only thing that matters is to lay bare one's soul; making poetry or painting is like making love. What 
happens is an exchange of blood, a total embrace ‚Äî reckless and defenseless!" Georges Duthuit, "Oil allez- 
vous Miro?," Cahiers d'art, nos. 8-10, 1956, p. 262. English translation from Jacques Lassaigne, Miro, 
Skira, 1963, p. 124.

associations, "dtoiles en des sexes d'escargot" stimulates no immediate sensuous images. None- 
theless ;i hidden image is there; its key is to be found in another poetic device borrowed from 
Desnos: syntactic inversion. 

An excellent example of syntactic inversion is found in the title of a poem by Desnos from 
the same collection, called Coeur en bouche.* 3 In lliis title, Desnos lias inverted a common 
French idiomatic expression: "bouche en coeur" (literally: a mouth in the form of a heart). 
The in\ ersion to "coeur en bouche" tor a heart in the form of a mouth) is at i Irst glance mean- 
ingless; vet the original idiomatic meaning remains as a latent presence in the newly created 
word-form. This new phrase, conceptually suspended between meaning and non-meaning (or 
in this case, between sense and nonsense), is open to all interpretations and is thereby a much 
richer poetic form. 

I sually in a simile, the second term supplies information about the first: this is true of 
bouche en coeur. Commonly, the first term of a simile remains relatively undetermined and 
is to be qualified by a more familiar image, such as "a storm roaring like a lion." or "night 
entering on wolves' feet" (both of which Desnos reversed in the same poem to read "'a lion 
roaring like a storm" and "wolves entering on night's feet"). 4 ¬∞ In Mini's image as it is present- 
ed, it would be absurd to suppose that we could learn more about stars through a comparison 
with snails' genitals, the configuration of which is totally unfamiliar to us. Furthermore, 
there is a traditional saving in French folklore that snails have no "sexe." 

The absolute illogic of Miros inscription stimulates questions rather than answers. However 
the reversed relationship between a familiar and a non-familiar image is subconsciously per- 
ceived as an aberration. This insight provides the first clue that Mint has inverted his syntax. 
Reversing the phrase to read "snails' genitals in the form of stars." an image begins to coalesce 
in our mind's eve. 

An understanding of the inscription does not provide us with a consummate understanding 
of the painting which exists as a coherent sensuous entity in itself. However, it does inject 
sexual allusions into the imagery, such as (pubic) hair, and a star-shaped (sexual) symbol, and it 
inv ests the elliptical lines with loose associations to a snail's coil. 

A final example of a tableau-poime in which Miro has appropriated specific devices from 
the poets is the painting "I n oiseau poursuit une abeille et l&lt;i baisse" (cat. no. 25). The image 
itself is the closest parallel in Mini's oeuv re to a Milligramme. The words, and the image they 
evoke, are plotted out according to the configuration of that image: the erratic trajectory of a 
bird's pursuit and the final consummation in the act of "lowering" (if that is in fact what Mini 
intended by "baisse" I. 

I ! I IcsiKiS. op. ( it .. p. 80. 

‚Ä¢ i 1'iurr In bouche rn coeur, or to make a heart-shaped mouth, means to affect sweetness and innocence. 

15 I lesnos, &lt;&gt;/&gt;. tit.. |&gt;. SI . 

‚Ä¢'&gt; The word Mir in French means both gender and genitals. In this particular saying, the meaning is that 
snails have no gender; thej are hermaphroditic. 



The interpretation of Miro's use of the verb baisser has always been problematic since, as 
it exists in this painting, it is incorrect French. One can baisser un rideau (lower a curtain); 
one cannot baisser une abeille (lower a bee). Various attempts have been made to read it as 
"laisse" (to leave) or as "baise" (to embrace). In these instances, Miro is accused of absent- 
mindedness (the involuntary substitution of a b for an /) or poor spelling (on the grounds that 
he is not French). However, in view of Miro's mastery of complex poetic forms elsewhere in his 
work, these explanations are unconvincing. 46a 

In 1925, Desnos wrote a short collection of homonymic verse. In these poems, a juxtaposition 
of homonyms, or the substitution of one homonym for another (as in the title of the collection: 
L'Aumonyme*' forces the mind to shift between unknown and known word-forms and images, 
much as occurs in svntactic inversion. One of the more accessible examples of Desnos' homo- 
nymic verse is his variation on the Lord's Prayer of which the first line reads : 

Notre paire quiet e, o yeux! (Our quiet peer, oh eyes!) 

for: Notre pere qui etes aux cieux (Our Blather Who art in Heaven) 

A homonymic poem must be read aloud in order for the phonetic similarities with oilier words 
and other meanings to be discovered. However, for a full understanding of the differences, the 
poem must be seen. 

In the preceding example, the reference is so universally known as to be obvious. When the 
basis of the equivocation is not obvious, Desnos supplies the alternate readings, as in the 
following untitled poem: 48

59 



The alternate "cili a bai-ser/cils a bai-ssis" provides the specific clue to Mini's painting. 
Although those two homonymic phrases are visually and phonetically almost identical, they 
project two entirely different meanings. The first one reads "cils a baiser" &lt; lashes to embrace). 
The second reads "cils abaisses" (lowered lashes). 

Mird's inscription "/ /; oiseau poursuit une abeille et la baisse" conflates essentially the same 
t w (i readings : "et Vabaisse" I "and Low ers it" in correct French) and "et la bain-" I "and embraces 
it"). However, Mini does not do ns the favor of writing either form down, preferring the in- 
finitely more provocative solution of an intermediate word-form which is grammatically 
empty. It is precisely the non-signifying nature of what is written which inspires our search 
for meaning beyond (but in proximity to) the written word. This is the implicit meaning of 
Desnos' poem: poetry is what lies beyond accepted "prison-forms." 

"Photo: ceci est la couleur de mes reves" (cat. no. 14) is a paradigm of Mini's poetic produc- 
tion and one of the artist's most enigmatic paintings. The least "painterly" of his works of this 
period, ''Photo" is one of the richest in associative meanings. 

At many levels, "Photo" is decidedly calligrammatic in the identification of words to an 
image-idea. On the level of immediate perception, the careful lettering with its thick and thin 
strokes and flourishes reveals that Miro sought, in his own way, to evoke printed copy. Print is 
the mechanical reproduction of handwriting, just as a "photo" is the mechanical reproduction 
(il visible reality. We can therefore read the painting as follows: "This is a reproduction of the 
color lit my dreams which is blue." 

The most important question raised is the meaning of blue. The blue spot, as inconsequential 
as it appears, is perhaps the most loaded image on the canvas. Although it can be read literally 
as the color blue, one suspects ‚Äî from experience ‚Äî that Mini's true meaning lies elsewhere. 
1 [ere blue is not just a visual entity but a symbol suggesting multiple readings. According to its 
most universal frame of reference, blue signifies hope, and dreams in this context are the images 
of hope. This is in keeping with Western symbolism, where blue is the color of hope, white 
represents faith and red represents charity. Moreover blue is particularly favored in Catalonia: 
Catalans paint their doors blue, indicating the sacred sanctuary of the home where personal 
ideals (dreams) can be nurtured as they cannot in the outside (real) world. The blue window in 
The Tilled Field is probably a displaced reference to this custom. The blue door also wards off 
evil spirits, as does a blue hand painted on doors in North Africa. Thus blue represents the 
( Catalan peasant's birthright to dreams. 

These meanings are contained iii the picture. However, Mini lias not said "Blue is the color 
of nn dreams." In an elliptical manner, his statement is: "This blue spot is the color of my 
dreams." suggesting that the configuration of the spot may be as important as the color. Para- 
doxically, both the idea of "blue" and the appearance of the configuration are contained in the 
single word "couleur." In French, couleur denotes "complexion" or "coloring" in both a 
literal and a figurative sense i for example, political "coloring"'. It also signifies the abstract 
concepts of character or substance. So that if blue is the color of Mini's dreams, the formless, 

60 



non-representational entity of the spot is their substance: as a receptacle for hallucinations, it 
is the stuff from which dreams and images can be drawn. 

We know that in the early twenties Miro drew inspiration from formless stains on the wall 
of his studio. Miro has even said that the fundamental imagery of The Harlequin's Carnival 
(1924‚Äî25) came to him in hallucinations. The dominant rhythm of the latter painting ‚Äî 
irrespective of any inherent pictorial necessity ‚Äî is established by the motifs in blue. This seems 
to present a case for Miro's non-premeditated association of the color blue with dreams. 

Finally, "Photo" must be considered in a broader frame of reference of both formal and 
metaphorical significance. Although other general visual references can be evoked (see dis- 
cussion, cat. no. 14), none is more pertinent to the artist's profound intentions than Mallarme's 
Un Coup de des (fig. 20). Miro's admiration for Mallarme is well known. 49 If he had not dis- 
covered him before coming to Paris, then he surely was introduced to his poetry by his neighbor 
Andre Masson who had illustrated Un Coup de des in 1914. The motifs of dice in The Family 
(1924) and in The Harlequins Carnival (1924‚Äî25) are Miro's earliest references to Un Coup 
de des. 50 "Photo" is a more comprehensive visual and conceptual homage to the poem. Through 
the emptying of the picture plane (comparable to Mallarme's emptying of the written page) 
and the concerted use of negative space to articulate the flow of image and content, Miro has 
made a literal and figurative allusion to Mallarme's poem about the human condition. 

The analogy is more significant than it may at first appear. Because the essential contradic- 
tion as conceived by Mallarme was between the notion of azur or the unattainable spiritual 
heights, and that of the abyss ‚Äî le gouffre ‚Äî or metaphysical depths in the Baudelairean 
tradition. Once again this can be interpreted as the opposition of hope and despair, such as it is 
seen on Miro's canvas through a small blue patch on a limitless void. 

Beginning in 1924, Miro executed a number of monochrome paintings in which traditional 
spatial cues are so radically eliminated as to have inspired the generic term "dream landscapes." 
These paintings are not spatially undefined; rather they are created according to a new set of 
pictorial premises. 51 Most of the initial paintings of this series were painted in a monochrome 
blue. 

Miro had learned to suspend his images simultaneously in space and on the surface of the 
canvas through the use of a Cubist scaffolding or grid (see cat. no. 8). Cubism had also taught 
him to signify a figure through a characteristic sign. 52 According to Miro's interpretation, 
Cubism was grounded in physical reality. Therefore, in an attempt to break away from Cubist 
formalism, Miro opted for the color blue: the blue of the sky, namely, light, space, ether, in- 

49 See for example Roland Penrose, op. cit., pp. 197-98.

also includes the depiction of dice as a reference to Mallarme.

Unity. Free from all associations with the earth, gravity, and form, blue appeared to be the most 
appropriate hue for the suspension and the diffusion of images which were Mini's poetic 
concern. 

Blue has been a favored color for many great Western artists: Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, to 
cite only three. However Miro's cultural heroes were elsewhere: they were Mallarme, Rimbaud, 
Novalis and, in his own country, the Symbolist poet Ruben Dario. 53 Miro's blue paintings of 
1925‚Äî26 and later of the sixties are not comparable in their use of blue to any oilier artist. 
Moreover no one else was producing blue paintings at this time. Somewhat later Dali and 
Tanguy were to immerse their landscapes in an over-all blue light, as a means of emphasizing 
their unreality (or surreality). However, these artists maintained the conventions of illusion - 
istic space, volume and gravity on which Miro had already turned his back by 1 924. 

Clearly, the poetic tradition was not a peripheral aspect of Miro's intellectual activity during 
this crucial formative period of his creative life. On the contrary, poetry was central, and a 
more pervasive force than it first appears. Poetry freed his imagination from acquired forms, 
and provided him with new techniques of invention and new images and symbols. Many of 
Miro's motifs and the manner in which they are interpreted and incorporated as subject matter 
come entirely from poetry. In other instances, where the images were inspired by other sources, 
they were reinforced or enhanced by poetic associations. Prevailing motifs such as ladders, 
wheels, flames, comets, biomorphic flowers; mythical creatures such as hydras, basilisks, 
lamias, although they may be found in pictorial sources such as Klee, Picabia, Arp, Romanes- 
que frescoes and illuminations, are sustained through their poetic interpretations. A motif of 
singular significance for Miro is the almost fetishist importance attached to hair. 34 Hair has no 
privileged status in Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism. The Dada painters did not honor it. 
However the erotico-poetic significance attributed to hair by Rimbaud and Lautreamont and 
the poetic tradition that stems from them is enormous and must be considered in its reference 
to Miro's obsession with this theme. 

When poetry is so important in the life of an artist, and particularly at such a formative stage 
in his career, there is reason to believe that it will maintain its hold on his creative psyche, even 
if it moves underground. 

In the twenties, Miro was one of the most poetic of painters. During the three subsequent 
decades, but for a few rare paintings and drawings, Miro eliminated this extreme emphasis on 
written poetry in order to concentrate on painting itself. From the point where he stood in 
1927 ‚Äî at the extreme limits of spatial illusionism ‚Äî there were only two alternatives: one. 
further development of his spatial structure which could have led him to the complete ab- 
straction which he has consistently eschewed: the second, the elaboration of his poetic motifs 

53 Ruben Dario 1867-1916) was an Argentine symbolist poet whose first major collection of poetry ‚Äî 
published in 1888 ‚Äî was called Aziri. He had a particularly strong influence on Picasso's generation in 
Barcelona and may even have inspired Picasso's Blue Period.

into a coin role Language of signs. With the help of poetry, Mini had arrived at a highly personal 
pictorial idiom which he now developed on its own terms. The precise poetic cues which were 
in and on the paintings were progressively relegated to the titles. Symbols with which he had 
made tentative experiments in the twenties became the basis of his formal repertory. They have 
remained constant ever since: women, escape ladders, stars, snails, birds, flaming genitals. 
spiders, flowers. 

According to Mini himself, at some point during this period, he became associated witli the 
School of Paris. He was not to emerge from this primarily pictorial (as opposed to literarj I 
tradition until approximately I960. His artistic liberation, as he calls it. was accomplished 
through his exposure to the New American Painting, which he discovered first in the United 
States in L947, 55 and subsequently in Paris in the early fifties. 06 This introduction to American 
painting encouraged him to turn his back on the School of Paris as four decades earlier he had 
turned his back on Cubism. 

The break was not total, as it had virtually been in the early twenties. But there exists a 
group of paintings from the sixties, some of which have been brought together here, where 
concurrent with a search for solutions to visual problems, there is a will to poetic form. Specific 
poetic techniques and devices have been absorbed. Lines by poets long dead no longer come to 
mind. With the maturity of years and experience, Mini has become much more his own poet. 
only referring to outside inspiration in the broadest general terms. 

In 1966, Mini visited Tokyo and Kyoto. As a Catalan and a native of Barcelona, he had 
been familiar with Japanese culture since his early youth. 5. Prior to his trip to Japan, Mho was 
already interested in Zen philosophy and Haiku poetry, subjects to which his friend the 
Japanese Surrealist Takiguchi 58 may have introduced him. Comparable to his instinctive grasp 
of Apollinaire's Milligrammes was Mini's instinctive understanding of Japanese Haiku, and the 
titles of a number of his paintings are short poems in themselves. Furthermore, as a result of 
this visit to Japan, Minis pictorial approach seems to have altered. The paintings executed on 
his return ‚Äî in their spareness and the expressive intensity of the sign ‚Äî are the most "calli- 
graphic" of his whole career. 

Mini's renewed poetic orientation of the sixties is illustrated by three groups of paintings in 
which the poetic dimension is explored in three different ways. I lie first group consists of large

single canvases inflected by the sparest registration of signs, and accompanied by richly evoc- 
ative titles. The second group of paintings contains more complex visual imagery and the lilies 
allude specifically to the written poetic idiom. The third group are large-scale mural paintings. 

The titles of the first group of paintings recall the spare yet allusive constellations of words 
characteristic of Haiku poetry: The Passage of the Migratory Bird (Fig. 21 ), Hair Pursued by 
Two Planets (cat. no. 52), Drop of Hater on the Rose-Colored Snow (cat. no. 51), The Smile of 
the Star to the Twin Tree of the Plain (cat. no. 49), Man and Woman in front of the Azure (cat. 
no. 60). Functioning as parallel poetry, the titles illustrate a complex poetic effect which is 
signaled on the canvas by a disembodied sign. These paintings are arrived at through a dis- 
tillation of images. Since they are paintings with precise but veiled meanings, their ultimate 
effects depend on the coincidence of verbal and visual poetic images. 

Thus in these highly unified colored or non-color fields, Miro is not merely attempting to 
solve pictorial problems. Each of these paintings exists as a "magnetic field" upon which 
constellations of meaning ‚Äî both visual and verbal ‚Äî coalesce, are integrated, and are then 
projected as a single poetic image. 

Tse second group of paintings illustrates the same phenomenon: Song of the Pbwels ( 1967), 
Words of the Poet (cat. no. 58), Poem I (cat. no. 55), If, and III (cat. no. 54), Song on White 
Background (1967). However the coefficients of meaning exist in a different relationship to 
each other and to the final effect. The visual propositions in these paintings are more articulate 
in themselves; the title merely serves to situate the frame of reference. Paintings such as the 
series Poem I, II and III, and Letters and Numbers Attracted by a Spark (cat. nos. 55‚Äî57) in- 
dicate how far Miro has developed in his concept of poetry. Generically, they could still be 
interpreted as tableaux-poemes but what was once a word or a poetic simile has been reduced to 
a linguistic sign. 

The large-scale paintings of the third group are among the most daring works Miro has made 
to date. In the placement of a few black lines or single spots of color on an evenly saturated field, 
these paintings are comparable to the painting of 1925, "Photo." 59 Only the scale, hue and 
poetic images have changed. The confrontation of an open space by an individual will to create 
(and thereby exist) is essentially the same, and once again the frame of reference is Mallarme s 
creation and positioning of form-meanings on the open (blank) page. 60 

Wordless, anonymous poems, these monumental paintings exist as wordless constellations, 
wordless c alii grammes, close in physical and metaphysical spirit to both Mallarme and Apol- 
linaire. They are calligrammes because their content ‚Äî the hazardous itinerary of the erring 
human condition ‚Äî is visibly projected through the tenuous searching trajectory of each line. 
They are constellations through the units of meaning or signs which exist midway between 
disintegration and cosmic order of the open field. These are not "color field" paintings in the 
American sense. Although Miro is also solving pictorial problems, his titles reveal meta-

physical preoccupations: Paintings for the Cell of a Solitary Man, Mural Paintings for a 
Temple{cdX. nos. 4-2-44), Bluel, Blue II, Blue III (cat. nos. 59-41). 

As noted earlier, the poet-seer (Rimbaud, Mallarme) aspires to the unattainable, the Totality. 
the "Azure." It is clearly no accident that Mho's first series of three monumental paintings 
was a cosmic blue. The ideal aim of such artists is to transcend the existential self in order to 
attain the anonymous self. This was expressed by Mallarme in the following passage: 

. . . je suis maintenant impersonnel . . . une aptitude qua II nivcrs Spirituel a se voir et a se 
ddvelopper, a travers ce qui fut rnoi. Fragile, comme est mon apparition terrestre, jc ne puis 
^ubir que les developpements absolument nccessaires pour que If nircrs retrouve, en ce rnoi. 
son identite. 01 

1 am now impersonal . . . a potential in which the Spiritual I niverse may see itself reflected 
and may develop through what was once my self. Fragile, like ni} earthly appearance. I can 
only submit to the absolutely necessary developments, so that the Universe may recover its 
identity in this self. 

This idea of the identification of the self to the Universe is comparable to the Japanese 
calligrapher's and the Haiku poet's spiritual position. It is Miro's objective as well, although he 
expresses it in less mystical terms : "Anonymity," Miro says, "allows me to renounce myself but 
in renouncing myself I come to affirm myself more strongly .... The same practice makes me 
seek the noise hidden in silence, the movement in immobility, life in the inanimate, the infinite 
in tiic Unite, forms in space and myself in anonymity." 62 It is through anonymity that the 
specificity of the human condition may be transcended. Only then might the vicissitudes of 
chance and error be abolished. Yet, the risks are great. Miro knows that in every human action. 
not the sublime but the human will emerge. This is the ultimate poetic act: a casting of the 
dice otI n Coupde des.

E l'l LOG I E 



For reasons of clarity we have treated the work of the "magnetic fields" on two separate 
levels: "the structure" and "the poetics." Yet the danger is thai a basic misunderstanding may 
arise from iliis procedure. For it might be thoughl from the first essay that Miro's formal 
ambitions to break through what he saw as the moribund propositions of Cubism into a totally 
new kind of space drove him by L924‚Äî 25 to construct a world whose very openness held the 
lineal of emptiness : an emptiness which Mini then filled with the images and ideas of the poets 
deal- to the Surrealists. Conversely, it might be understood from the second essay that Mini's 
response to thai poetry, which began by 1924 to affect nearly every image he made, led him 
almost as an afterthought to create a new space: one that could contain without contradiction 
or interruption the implications of that poetry. In short, the authors have run the risk of 
summoning up that ancient ghost which haunts discussions of art by enforcing an uneasy split 
between form and content. 

Yet we understand these two issues ‚Äî poetry and structure in Mini s art ‚Äî as being completely 
continuous one with another. If Mini had always refused to compress the space of his world 
into the narrow pictorial confines of Cubism, if he had always demanded that painting release 
him into a deep space of light and color, one feels that Ibis was a function of a sensibility already 
affected hy the Symbolist poetry of his native Catalonia, and strengthened by his profound 
response to the poets he read and met with when he came to Paris. If he knew from the moment 
he arrived that Cubism and Dada were things of the past, il is because this knowledge had been 
some years in preparation. Thus the painter, who begins probably in the summer of 192") and 
certainly by the winter of 1923 _' 1 to re-invent his pictorial world, to remake it on grounds 
of both form and content, is responding to a deep internal necessity. It is the necessity of an 
aesthetic conscience which tells him that his own emotions have to do with sensuous release into 
a space that unites self-consciousness with the merging of the self in the world beyond it. Such 
emotions parallel with extreme closeness those of Desnos, for example in Corps ft biens, or 
those of Eluard when he writes :

On his own terms, the terms he knew as a painter, Miro creates a world in which it can he 
said: "Elle imagine que l'horizon a pour elle denoue sa ceinture." 2 And lliat is not a world 
which can contemplate imagery divorced from the formal means which create it. The "mag- 
netic fields" operate on a mutual attraction between poetry and the space that was invented to 
hold it ‚Äî for the poetry already implied that space, and for Miro the space was meaningless 
without the poetry.

The Tilled Field was started in the summer of 192") at 
Miro's family farm in Montroig along with The Hunter 
(cat. no. 2) and Pastoral (cat. no. 3). All three works 
were completed the following winter in Paris. The Tilled 
Field, as the first of the three, is rightly considered the 
transitional work between an earlier succession of 
tentative styles and Miro's mature poetic idiom. 
A comparison of The Tilled Field to The Farm (fig. 22), 
a painting executed two years earlier in similar circum- 
stances, is informative. The Farm shows a fairly faithful 
rendering of the familiar landscape at Montroig. Painted 
in a detailliste manner, The Farm allegedly has Japanese 
prints and Persian miniatures as its stylistic sources. As 
in the latter, each motif is treated with meticulous care. 
The unity of the image lies in the depiction of a single 
well-defined subject. Although The Tilled Field is also a 
unified image, its unity cannot be defined either in terms 
of its sources or its subject. The references inherent in 
the painting are essentially four-foldt : they can be ident- 
ified as Medieval imagery, the farm at Montroig, fictions 
of the artist's imagination and poetry. 

A number of aspects of the painting indicate that the 
artist's approach to his subject has undergone a radical 
change. The colors of The Tilled Field are not the crisp 
daylight hues of The Farm, but the muted ‚Äî nocturnal 
and supernatural ‚Äî tones of Romanesque frescoes. 
Whereas the composition of The Far?n was essentially 
that of an all-over pattern, with equal emphasis on each 
motif in relation to the whole, The Tilled Fields shows a 
definite hierarchy of forms which is based on the artist's 
private and irrational scale of values. 

The fundamental structure of The Tilled Field can be 
defined as three horizontal bands. Reading from top to 
bottom as sky, sea, earth, this form of composition is 
common to the Catalan Romanesque frescoes Miro knew 
well. Other motifs of Medieval inspiration include some 
of the imagery in the lower right of the canvas : the 
lizard with conic cap, the pine tree ‚Äî a transposition of 
the archetypal image of the tree of life (see fig. 25) ‚Äî the 
decorative patterning and silhouettes of the fish and 
serpent, and the extreme stylization of the rooster, which 
is remarkable when one compares it to the rooster in 
The Farm. The pine cone encrusted with tiny eves recalls 
the eyes found on the bodies of animals and the wings 
of seraphim in early Medieval art (see fig. 24). To the 
left of center of the canvas can be seen an irrigation 
ditch. The heavy shading and flowing curves derive from

tlic stylistic conventions to signify water found in Cata 

Ian frescoes. 

Miro's source of inspiration was not solely Medieval 
imagery. Many of the motifs seen here appeared two 
years earlier in The Farm : the cactus in the upper left. 
the goat (now gnawing on a cactus leaf), the farmhouse 
covered with cracks and vines, the horse, the dog. In the 
lower right, one sees again the lizard, the snail, the 
rooster and two rabbits. Even the "tilled field" which 
gives the painting its name is found on the far right in 
The Farm. The overturned pail (now encircling the 
lizard) and the folded newspaper occur here also for the 
second time. 

Aside from Medieval sources and motifs from the Mon- 
troig landscape, there is another category of imagerv in 
The Tilled Field which is not immediately recognizable. 
This includes the stylized fig tree ‚Äî the dominant motif 
in the left portion of the painting ‚Äî and the ear on the 
trunk of the pine tree on the right. 

The fig-tree motif is a pure fiction of Miro's imagina- 
tion. It is a conflated image of a fig tree and a frontier- 
post, situated on the border between France and Spain. 
On the right of the upright pole is the flag of Spain : the 
two flags on the left are those of Catalonia and France, 
whereas the branch-semaphore extended on the French 
side bears the flag of Italy. It is of interest to note that 
Miro shows his allegiance to France by placing the 
Catalan flag on the French side of the border. 

Miro's image of the disembodied ear on the trunk of the 
pine tree, as original as it is, is not a unique example of 
this motif in the art of the period. In 1 ')_!_!. Max Ernst 
and Paul Eluard collaborated on an illustrated book of 
poetry : Les Malheurs des immortels. One of the collages 
by Max Ernst depicts a gigantic ear affixed by an arrow 
to a windowpane (fig. 25). The isolated ear appeared 
once again in a mural panel entitled he Reveil officiel 
du serin ( The Canary's Official Awakening) that Ernst 
painted for Eluard's house at Eaubonne in 1 92 &gt;. 
This time the ear was attached to a musical (brass) 
instrument. Although Miro has said that he merely 
wanted to depict "a living tree, with eyes that see and 
ears that hear." 1 in view of his close friendship with 
Eluard starting in 1920-21. there is a strong possiblitiv 
that he knew these works.

The remaining motifs can be described simply. The bird 
in the *kv. resembling a mechanical toy and which Miro 

likens to an arrow, evokes the diagrammatic drawings of 
Picabia; 2 it anticipates the automata or wind-up toy Like 

figures which appear frequently in .Mini's oeuvre from 
that time on. The peculiar configurations of the clouds 
can he compared to cloud formations by Henri Rousseau, 
and. m particular, those found in his self-portrait of 
1890, which was well-known in Paris. 3 The plowing 
figure on the right is inspired by the prehistoric cave 
paintings at Altamira which Miro knew. The sail on the 
horizon and the planted furrow placed diagonally and to 
the lower right of the farmhouse need no further ex- 
planation here. 

1 1 is astonishing that from such disparate visual material 

all of which remains legible and thus close to its 
original form ‚Äî Miro has created a unified image. The 
unity of The Tilled Field resides not in the subject but in 
the \ ision the work projects, a vision of a naively super- 
natural world. Naive form and supernatural content 
.ire two characteristics of early Medieval art. Parallel to 
Medieval art, a unified vision which can only exist in the 
mind interrelates the diverse motifs in The Tilled Field. 
The unity of the canvas is not visual but para \ isual. and 
in this case the source of the artist's vision is not in reli- 
gious belief but in poetry. 

The poetic source which oriented Miro's vision was 
( in illaume Apollinaiiv's UEnchanteur pourrissant.* The 
hero of Apollinaire's poetic work was the Medieval 
wizard Merlin. In Apollinaire's version of the legend, 
.Merlin is trapped in a tomb by Viviane, "the lady of the 
lake." Since he is only half mortal, having been begotten

him signifies the tomb in which he is entrapped. The 
tomb, as in Apollinaire's text, is at the edge of a lake. 
This identification of particular images further explains 
the eve in the foliage and the ear on the trunk of the 
tree: the scene is set in an enchanted forest. 

As noted above, most of the animals placed around the 
tree were found in The Farm. The two exceptions are the 
serpent and the fish, both of which appear in UEnchan- 
teur. Serpents are the first visitors to Merlin's tomb. The 
fish is evoked by a druid who is trying to "redevenir 
poisson" or return to the state of a fish."' 

It is however in Apollinaire's final chapter, presented as 
a monologue by Merlin, that the most striking parallel 
imagery occurs. Since the chapter is long, and the images 
are scattered throughout it, we shall be obliged to ex- 
cerpt them here: 

Les charbons du del etaient siproches que je craignais 
leur ardeur 6 . . . Deux animaux dissemblables s'accou- 
plaient . . . Mais le chant des chumps laboures etait mer- 

veilleux . . . mesyem multiplies me couronnaient atten- 
tivement . . . Ft File, a la derive, alia combler un golfe oil 
du sable aussitot pousserent des arhres rouges . . . Le eiel 
etait plein de feces et d'oignons . . . Je visit ui . . . des 
chaumieres abandonnees . . . Des vaisseaux dor, sans 
matelots, passaient a I'horizon . . . Des ombres dissem- 
blables assombrissaient de leur amour Vicariate des 
voilures, tandis que mes yeux se multipliaient dans les 
fie lives . . ." 

5 Apollinaire. L'Fnehanteur pourrissant. Gallimard, 
Paris. 1972. p. 25. 

f) The metaphor of burning coals in the sky could be 
associated with Miro's image of the sun in The Hunter. 
although this is not its usual interpretation I see 
cat. no. 2). 

‚Ä¢ "The coals in the sky were so close that 1 feared their 
ardent glow . . . two dissimilar animals were coupling 
. . . but the song of the tilled fields was wonderful . . . 
my multiplied eves formed an attentive crown . . . And 
the island, floating free, came to rest in a gulf where 
led trees sprang from the sand . . . the skv was full of 
feces and onions ... 1 visited . . . abandoned thatched 
cottages . . . Sailorless gold ships passed on the horizon 
. . . Dissimilar shadows darkened their scarlet sails 
w ith lu\ e. while my e\ es multiplied in the rivers . . ." 
( Apollinaire, op.cit., pp. S7-90.) 



In Miro's free interpretation of these images, the two 
coupling animals are transformed into a mare nursing 
her foal. The "champs laboures" have become "la terre 
labouree." The multiplication of eyes, and the red tree 
growing at the edge of a gulf are represented. Miro's 
farmhouse is dilapidated and abandoned. Apollinaire's 
scarlet sails on the horizon, darkened by shadows, have 
been translated into delicate pink sails tinged with 
scarlet. 

The sky full of "feces and onions" requires further ex- 
planation. In Miro's The Harlequin's Carnival of 
1924-25, a mythical insect perched on the male figure's 
mustache is seen dropping what Miro has identified as 
excrement. These same round shaded gray motifs are 
found in the darkened sky in the upper right of The 
Tilled Field. Moreover, the pine-cone motif derives from 
Miro's frequent depictions of onions with long tails, as 
found in Still Life with Rabbit, 1920, The Family, 1924, 
and Nude, 1926. 

Hence, despite the complexity of Miro's sources, The 
Tilled Field projects an extremely coherent image, based 
on a unified poetic vision. Apollinaire, in his preface to 
Les Mamelles de Tiresias, defined Surrealism as an 
invention after nature which in fact creates a new 
reality. 8 In L'Enchanteur pourrissant, Apollinaire took 
a Medieval legend and translated it by means of a 
highly imaginative poetic idiom into a new image of 
"surreality." Miro has done the same here. As such, The 
Tilled Field is his first Surrealist painting.

The Huntei was begun in the summer of L 923, following 
the first winter of Miro 's relationship -w ith Massonand the 
pods who were to become Surrealists. In his major study 

ol Mini's art. Jacques Dupin speaks of M ini's disa\ owal 
at this point of the realism of liis earlier st\ le. "It had 
become impossible," Dupin says of Miro, "for him to 
wrest anything further from external reality." 1 Dim as 
sing The Tilled Field and The Hunter. Dupin speaks of 
the pressures on Miro from the Surrealists' demand t hal 
artists take up a more visionary subject-matter, and 
thereby affirm the continuity between the external 
world and an internal reality of dream and fantasy. Hut 
even before the Surrealists made their official appeal. 
the idea of visionary subjects had permeated the poetic 
circles of the young avant-garde, and this idea had 
affected the visual imagery of the early 1920s. In various 
avant-garde magazines the image of a disembodied e\ e. 
appearing as an illustration for a text, had come to stand 
for the personae of the poets and writers as seers. 2 In the 
cover illustration for Eluard's Repetition*. 1 { )22. Max 
Ernst used a detatched eye. pierced by a line or thread 
which is held by two hands (fig. 26). The reference here 
seems to be a line of sight which is continuous from one 
side of the eye to the other, that is, between internal and 
external vision. Perspective diagrams from the 1 5th 
century onward often show an eye with sight lines pro- 
jecting from it as a way of representing the cone of vision 
as it intersects the portion of the external world seen 
from a given point. Ernst's collage from Repetitions 
takes this traditional way of diagramming vision, and 
redirects it to serve the concerns he shared with his con 
temporaries. 

Ernst's collage seems to provide a specific reading for 
one of the most prominent and puzzling images in The 
Hunter, namely the eye at the pictures center attached 
to a disk and pierced by the horizon line. 3 Not only does

Miro's image share with Ernst's the motif of the Iran 
sected eye, but both of them portra\ the pupil of I lie eye 
mi the globe of the full disembodied eyeball. To under 
stand the image as it appears in The Hunter, it is impor- 
tant l&lt;&gt; note that Miro himself has spoken of crossing the 
horizon by the trajectory of his vision which unites earth 
.1 ml skj along a vertical axis. 4 Another trajectory which 
crosses the horizon is also involved here : one which 
extends backward and forward in depth, moving from 
the subjective spate behind the painter's eye out towards 
the outposts of external, objective realitj .The eye is. then, 
literally the hub of this painting, connecting its external 
vanishing point and the internal source of its imagery. 
(Note the three lines-of-sight which both project from 
and vanish into the point at the center of the pupil.) 
Although this imagery is in part a projection of fantasy, 
it is also the product of conventional sign-systems for 
representing the world ‚Äî those of language for example. 
Thus the internality Miro refers to is a far more com 
plex one than simply that of personal fantasy. It refers to 
a whole variety of projective languages. 5 

One of the conventional signs Miro uses appeai-s in the 
word-fragment '"Sard" written in the painting's low r er 
right corner. This word has been interpreted in two 
conflicting ways in the Literature on this work. One of 
the earliest interpretations is that it is the first syllable 
of sardana ‚Äî the name of a Catalan folk dance. 6 Other 
scholars have read it as a fragment of the word sardine ‚Äî 
seeing it as a label for the creature in the foreground 
which is a fish. 7 (Miro represents fish elsewdicre in these 
years in a similar manner: a semi-circular wedge for the 
head and a triangular tail connected by a linear shaft ‚Äî 
the head sometimes shown with a long ear-like fin 
wa\ ing above it.) 8 



At the left side of the painting, the hunter stand-., 
cap on his head (see cat. no. 8). rabbit in one band, 
and gun in the other. His body is reduced to line : the 
stem-like torso connects his flaming heart and his 
genitals (see cat. no. 20). In the sea behind him on the 
right is a metallic cone carrying the flag of Spain, prob- 
ably an image of an armored ship. 9 and on the lei t a 
device with ladder and wheel carrying the crossed flags 
of Catalonia and France. 10 In the sky the sun appears as 
a modeled lozenge with tentacle-like rays. Although 
attempts have been made to connect this depiction of the 
sun with religious images of the Sacred Heart. 11 there 
is probably stronger evidence, given in its appearance 
elsewhere in Mini's work, to read it as a more eroticized 
image. This representation of the sun reoccurs in the skv 
of The Harlequin's Carnival, where it rhymes visually 
with the creature at the center of the carnival which 
Miro identified as "a woman's sex in the form of a 
spider." 12 And it strikingly resembles the bulb with pro- 
jecting roots which Miro uses to portray the female 
genitals in the 1924 work. The Family (Dupin. 
p. 206). 

Two images in The Hunter probably reflect the appeal 
de Chirico's work had for the Surrealists as well as for 
Miro. The draftsman's triangle which appears in the 
lower left corner (and reappears in many paintings of 
the in ill- 1920s, see cat. no. 5). has a clear precedent in 
the series of metaphysical still lifes which de Chirico 
painted in the late teens. The three pairs of cones and 
spheres also relate to the geometric shapes which in- 
habited those de Chiricos: the dotted lines indicating 
movement recall the stitched seams seen on de Chirico's 
mannequins.

Merlin in the summer of L923, Pastoral schematizes the 
landscape in a manner thai is even more reduced than that 
of The Hunter. Some of the elements in Pastoral are la mi 
liar from the paintings thai preceded ii thai summer, 
others arc harder to read. The fish swimming in a pond 

at one end of which is a rabbit's hutch (or hole) evokes 

the righl side of The Tilled Field (cat. no. I ).' 'The cow in 
the center of Pastoral relates to the horse at the center of 
The Tilled Field, but the animal is now simplified in the 
manner of the LVIajorcan plaster toys M iro was fond of 
collecting. 2 Similarly, the form in the (enter background 
with smoke coming out of one side recalls the farm 
house in the same position m The Tilled Field. To the 
right of that house in Pastoral is an imaginary structure 
symbolized by the draftsman's triangle which appeared 
in a more minor role in The Hunter. To the left of the 
central farmhouse is a third structure which is much 
more enigmatic until one recalls the 1918 House with 
Palm Tree (D. 59), a work which clarifies this form in 
Pastoral. 1 n the L918 pic tu re a palm with feathery fronds 
stands in front of a house whose simple, four-square 
silhouette is interrupted only by the semi circular pro- 
tuberance of a sundial at the level of the cornice line. 
The lines of the dial radiate out to the numerals ( ). HI. 
1 1 . 12. etc. : and above the door of the house is the in- 
scription and date : "ANTf 1912." In Pastoral, house, 
sundial and palm are compressed into a simple shape, 
scored by two horizontal lines with "9" and "10" at their 
left ends, and "A." at the upper right. 3 'The "9" and 
" 10" recollect the numerals on the sundial and the "A." 
is probably a reference to the date carried by the original 
house. 1 Arching above these houses is a sign for a rain 
bow. Elsewhere .M iro uses this de\ ice of parallel arcs 
for clouds (fig. 2). and later signifies clouds simply by

Painted in his Paris studio on the rue Blomel in the 
spring of 1924, Portrait of Madame B. is the firsl of a 
series of paintings "with yellow grounds which Miro 
developed that summer in Montroig. The subjeel is from 
Jarry's UbuRoi, and this inspiration drawn from Jarry 
is not without precedent. In 1923, Max Ernst did a 
painting called Ubu hnperator. 

The unusual figure of the woman as it is found hen is 
a variant of a kerosene-lamp interpreted by Miro as the 
female silhouette. This image first appears in 1 92 k Miro 
will subsequently develop this woman lamp image, but 
with a shift of focus : no longer the representation of a 
complete female figure, the lamp will allude specifically 
to a flaming vagina. In this form, the kerosene lamp is 
found in a drawing and a painting by the same title 
executed after Miro's return to Paris in the fall of 1 92 I 
(Dupin, p. 145 and D. 88). 

The title of the painting. Portrait of Madame I}., alludes 
to a young woman Miro knew at that time in Paris. 
Usually understood as ''Madame Breton." this inter- 
pretation is false. For an extensive discussion of the 

literary sources see pp. 41-45.

The image of The Kiss relates to a series of 'works done 
in 1925 which show the touching and sometimes the 
fusion between a male and a female figure. The name of 
the works in this series ‚Äî like The Lovers, The Kiss, 
The Coitus ‚Äî are not Miro's, who has made known his 
dislike for these titles. 1 In this painting, which calls to 
mind Miro's contemporaneous transformation of the 
globe of the kerosene lamp, male and female are simpli- 
fied to two globe-shaped forms. In drawings of 1924 the 
lamp is likened to the female body ‚Äî the flame and its rays 
of heat made to double as genitalia. (See cat. nos. 5. 20.) 

1 Dupin. op. cit., p. 168. 



Here the two forms fuse at a single point to create a 
continuous figure in the shape of the sign for infinity : 
oo. The flame-like lines spreading from the right half 
of this composite identify it as the female part of the 
image. The most reduced and sign-like of all the works 
in this series, the painting's treatment of the notion of 
coupling by means of the symbol oo also includes ‚Äî 
within the image of the figures ‚Äî a notion of their space. 
It suggests that that space is simultaneously the infinity 
of an internal emotion and the infinity of a point where 
sight focuses at the horizon of the external field. 

The green ground is rare in Miro's work of this period.

During the year L925, M iro executed lour variations on 
tins theme. The first version is detailed and descriptive, 
much in the enumerative spirit of The Harlequin x s Car- 
nival, L924 25. [n the final version (cat. no. 9), the theme 
is barerj recognizable, due to the shift of emphasis from 
the figure as a figure to the space as a certain concept 
and expression of space. 1 

This is either the second or the third version, where only 
the essential attributes of the peasant are retained : the 
hiti ettina, or peasant cap, the peasant's eyes ( radiating 
lines of vision), and his heard. The diagrammatic artic- 
ulation of the figure shows the stage to which the stick 
figure in The Hunter (cat. no. 2) has progressed. 

The stylization and heraldic symmetry of the image 
endow it with an emblematic character. The presence of 
the Rousseau like clouds (as in The Tilled Field, cat. 
no. 1) destroy this reading however and indicate that this 
is not a static emblem on a field hut an animated figure 
floating in the sky. 

Similar to several other paintings of this period (e.g. 
Figure, L925, D. L06, Musee National d'Art Moderne, 
Paris), Miro has organized the painting according to a 
grid structure. This was in order to loosen the syntax of 
a traditional figure/ground relationship with its impli- 
cal ions of perspective and gravity. The fact that the left 
eye is smaller than the right effects an imperceptible re- 
cession in space which can be read as a visual pun.

The major figural ive elements are the peasant's cap and 

‚Ä¢is] ting star. The former was a sign of Miro's Catalan 

roots. The latter, an image which Mir6 refers to in a text 
In- w rote in the late 1930s recalling his thin king at this 
period : "... falling stars &lt; rossing the blue space to pin 
themselves on the bodj of mv brunette who dives into 
the phosphorescent Ocean after describing a luminous 
circle." 1 'The origin of this star in M iro's work is prob- 
ablj re la I cd to M iro's introduction to t lie art of Paul 
1\ Ice. It is difficult to discover which of Klee's paintings 
M iri) knew, but he claims that his first glimpse of Klee 
¬´ as in a book of reproductions which \ndrc Masson 
showed him iii 1?)24. The star depicted as a graphic sign 
is a recurrent image in that period of Klee's art to which 
Miro was first introduced (e.g. Undei a Black Shu. 1918, 
The Magic Night, 1919). The star first appears in a work 
h\ Miii'iin 1'IJI The Hermitage, \}. 92 and "Sourirede

Klee had his first one-man show in Paris in the late fall 
of 1925. 2 For the catalogue of this exhibition Eluard 
wrote a poem in response to Klee's art : 



Sin la pente fat ale, le voyageur profite 

De la (incur du jour, verglas et suns cailloux 

Et les rent bleus d' amour, ddcouvre sa saison 

Qui parte a tons les doigts de annul.- astres en bague. 

Sur la plage la mer a laisse ses oreilles 

Et la sable creuse la place d'un beau crime 

he supplice est plus dur aux bourreaux qu'aux victimes, 

Les couteaux sont des signes et les balles des larmes? 

On the fatal slope, the traveler prof its 
From the favor of daylight, for it is icy and without 

[gravel 
And, his eyes blue with love, he discovers that season 
II hich wears rings set with stars on all its fingers. 

The sea has deposited its ears on the beach 
And the hollowed sand is the place of a beautiful crime 
The punishment is harder for the hangmen than for the 

[victims. 
The kjiives are signs and the bullets are tears. 

This version of Head of a Catalan Peasant is the last in 
the series of four (see cat. no. 8). For a discussion of its 
formal structure, see pp. 1 iN-20 above.

The theme of the pipe smoker is frequent throughout the ¬£b 

early part of M iro's ceuvre. The motif of the pipe is 



m 



found in his earliest portraits and still lifes of 1917-18. 
A man smoking a pipe is prevalent starting in l ( )2~&gt; -2 f 
with the depiction of the hunter in the \\ ork of the same 

name, and recurring in The Family. 192 I and The liar \\ 

lequ in's Carnival. 1921 25. In the last two paintings, the ^ 

pipe identifies the male figure, and thereby serves as an ‚ñ† 

essentia] masculine attribute. Cirici Pellicer has sug- 
gested that the identification of a pipe with masculinity 
stems from a Spanish tradition. 1 

In schematic drawings of 192 I. a smoking pipe is often 

visualh "rh\ med" with a phallus of the same shape | % 

'sec fig. ".(I), reconfirming that the act of smoking is 

identified with masculinity. This interpretation does not 

obviate another reading of smoke as the stuff of dreams 

and hallucinations. 

The image of the smoking man is not without precedent. A 

Often found in Cubist portraits, he was rendered in ^*

calligrammatic form by Guillaume Apollinaire in a 

poem tailed "Fumees" or "Smoke" (see fig. 28). In this 

calligi amine the accent lias been displaced from the man 

to smoke itself, and its ethereal poetic quality . \\ 

By 1924, Mii'(') will have de\ eloped the theme to its most 

abstract expression in another painting called Head oj 

a Smoker (I). 96), where, like here, all that remains is 

the smoke of the pipe. j 

These considerations provide a key to the reading of this 

painting, "which, although called Head of a Smoker, is f t %f | | f¬ª A O XT Q 

obviously jusl "smoke." [n view of its decidedly phallic ^ ^-^ ^"^ ¬ª*^ 

billow ing form, all the above connotations are contained 
in the image.

The escargot or snail is one ol Miro's constant motifs. 
Obviously part of liis familiar landscape at Montroig, it 

\\ .is to be assimilated into his emotional landscape and 
his poetic repertory. It is found in paintings as early as 
a still life, Bottle and Snail, of 1916, and reappears in 
The Farm, 1921-22, The TilledField, 1923-24, Snail, 
Unman. Flower, Stai . 193 1. Parsonages in the Night 
Guided by tlie Phosphorescent Tracks of Snails, 194(1. 

The association between stars and snails is understand- 
able in the sense that both, for Mho. are essentially 
spiral configurations. The artist frequently depicts stars 
leaving a spiraling trail of sparks (see cat. no. 28 I. The 
juxtaposition of the two motifs ‚Äî the astral and the ele- 
mentary ‚Äî as well as their use in an alliterative context 
is found in other literature of the period. An example of 
this is seen in a poem hv Tristan Tzara which was pub- 
lished in April 1918 in the French magazine SIC* 

Jiolon lampes une queue une lumiere blanche 
tres blanche fuir soleil et etoiles escargot

[couteaux 

Violin lamps a tail a white light 

very white to flee sun and stars snail 

or flying fish in the station a human foot 

waiting-room for different pots in terra cotta two knives 

The imagery in Tzara's poem is strikingly close to the 
spirit of Miro's imagery in 1925-27. It is perhaps due to 
poetic affinities that Tzara was one of the first poets 
Miro met in Paris during his first winter there ‚Äî tin- 
winter of 1919-20. They were to become great friends 
and. slightly later. Miro executed his first lithographs for 
a collection of Tzara 's poetry L'Arbre des voyageurs. 
published in 1950. For a more extensive analysis of this 
particular painting see pp. 57‚Äî58. 



1 No page number. Miro was still living in Barcelona at 
this time: however, since SIC published poetry by 
many of his Spanish friends (J. Perez Jorha. J.V. Foix), 
and since Dupin reports that Miro started reading the 
avant garde magazines prior to that time, we can he 
Fairh certain that he was reading SIC.

In conversation with the authors. Miro described as 
'"automatic" the rapid, random marks set down in 
response to configurations he might see on the page of 
a notebook or on a letter he received. Reacting to aspects 
of these things which strike him : "ce qui mefrappe, 
tzack!", he will transfer the visual excitation to the sur- 
face of a drawing or painting. The linear elements in 
"Oh! mi de ces messieurs . . ." were arrived at in thisway.

The Siesta is probably one of the earliest of the paintings 
on blue grounds of 1 925. Beginning from a naturalistic 
drawing of the scene, Miro transformed its elements into 
weightless, disembodied forms. As in The Hunter (cat. 
no. 2) the dotted line is used to designate the placement 
of the body in space without actually rendering its mass. 
As is also the case in the earlier work, Miro uses letter- 
ing as a prominent visual element. Miro has identified the 
numeral "12" as signifying the time of day for sleep on 
the beach. This particular use of numerals also appears 
in the earlier Pastoral, where it is specifically connected 
with a sundial (see cat. no. 3). Jacques Dupin supplies the 
following information about this painting: 



The Siesta was originally a very detailed descriptit e 
composition, a scene involving two persons on a beach. 
The slumbering charactei of this picture ‚Äî which pro- 
vides the title ‚Äî is now conveyed by an unidentifiable 
dreamy white form ; the female swimmer has become a 
pure ideogram, while the dented blue form hardly sug- 
gests that it formerly represented the line of mountains 
closing in the horizon around MontroigJ 

For a discussion of the formal role of the white form, 

see pages 57-58 above.

Roland Penrose lias suggested that M iro's interest in the 
appearance of words and their magical powers stems 
from a long Catalan tradition.' Catalan peasants decorate 
their carts with arabesques, and write their name and 
sometimes inscriptions on them with a flourish. Tin n 
fore Catalans attach great importance to the way words 
and lettering look, and this importance is found through- 
out Miros work, not only in his inscriptions but in his 
signature. 

This tableau-poeme is one of the simplest in imagery 
and most evocative in meaning that Miro was to do. It 
is unique in that the primary sensuous experience is in 
the graphic inscription. However, as xve have noted else- 
where (see pp. (&gt;()-() 1 ) the prime source of poetic meaning 
is in the organization of the painting and the ine\ itable 
associations of the spot of blue. 

The disposition of the word "Photo" on the canvas, in 
its visual and semantic relationship to the rest of the 
painting, corresponds to a title-to-poem relationship 
typical of much poetry of the period (see fig. 51). The 
relationship of the title to the verse was usually ambig- 
uous as it is here.

During the v/inter of l ( )J"). M Lro created a number of 
paintings of this kind, identifiable b} the presence of a 
floating white figure on a blue or brown ground. Jacques 
Dupin has described these personages in the following 
passage : 




100 



...it is only rarely in these works that a descriptive 
approach to reality served as a point of departure . . . It 
often happens that a figure (or "personage") emerges 
from the progression of his line, from the effusion of 
spots, . . .Mird created many of these "personages" but 
they are always the same uncertain, ghostly ivhite, with 
a fluctuating, sinuous contour; the only parts insistently- 
developed are the head, the foot, the genitals, or the eye. 
These "personages" are devoid of all materiality, all 
corporeal density. Because of their spectral appearance, 
they seem to be figures yet unborn, still not given life. 
They ignore the laws of gravitation; they hover in the 
clouds or glide through liquid or viscous matter. They 
are the very substance of dreams and hallucinations. 1 

In spite of these explanations, Miro's imagery remains 
enigmatic. Even when the symbols are recognizable, they 
are often endowed with double meaning. The form is 
obviously meant to be an anthropomorphic figure, with 
an outsized head with teeth, and a large foot. The star- 
shaped sign on the head is usually a sign for the female 
genitals ; here displaced to the head, it could be that, or 
an eye. The dotted circle around a spot with radiating 
spokes also has two readings in keeping with Miro's 
private sign language : the male genitals or an eye 
projecting lines of vision. These unresolved ambiguities 
hold the viewer in a state of conceptual suspension. In 
keeping with the Surrealist propensity for double 
meanings, there is no "correct" reading.

Within the blue field of this painting t lie re appear only 
two elements : a horizon line along its center, and in the 
upper corner a star. Speaking of his teacher in Barce- 
lona, MirO said : 

1 remember two paintings of JJrgell in particular, both 
characterized by long, straight, twilit horizons which 
cut the pictures in halves: one a painting of a moon 
above a cypress tree, another with a crescent moon low 
in the sky. Three forms which have become obsessions 
with me represent the imprint of I'rgell : a red circle. 
the moon, and a star. They keep coming bach, each time 
slightly different.^ 

In discussing Miro's tendency to structure his work of 
the mid-1920's with the two-part separation caused by 
the horizon line, Jacques Dupin writes: 
To Miro, the horizon is a magical rather than a symbolic 
sign, indicating presence in the world but also remind- 
ing that the external world serves as an arbiter between 
the subjective powers and their expression. It separates, 
but even more it unites ‚Äî it holds earth and sky. the real 
and the imaginary together. For all that, the horizon is 
ideal, being visible without being traced, and as it ap- 
pears is no more than a boundary between zones of con- 
trasting colors: those of earth and sky. 2 

The use of contrasting colors occurs in paintings pre- 
ceding this one (like The Hunter where sea and sky con- 
trast with the ground) and in somewhat later work (the 
landscapes of 1927). In this painting the unification of 
the visual world is effected by a single field of color 
which simultaneously addresses itself to the unity of the 
pictorial world. The reticence with which Miro states 
the horizon line here speaks to this need for a unity 
which nothing must interrupt.

I n 1 926 M iri) collciborated with Max Ernst on decors for 

the Bitlh'ls 1 usses production of Romeo et Juliette, con- 
fining their activities mainly to designing backdrops for 
the two acts. 1 The painting that remains as evidence of 
Miro's participation is a project for one of these drop 
curtains. The painting joins a flaming heart and a symbol 
for the female genitals by means of .1 \ ertical line and the 
twisting coils of a white, tubular form. The heart, which 
appears in earlier works like The Hunter, (cat. no. 2), 
Portrait of Madame A.. L924, (D.86). and The Family. 
I ''J I I) u pin. p. 206), has here a particularly emblematic 
look, bringing to mind Rimbaud's association between 
the flaming heart and heraldic imagery : "Iignettes . . . 
essoreni les e,eui .&lt; panaches de flammes." (\ ignet- 
tes . . where soaring hearts raise their crests of flame.) 2 

1 Romeo et Juliette was subtitled 1/ 1 ehearsal without 
scenery in two parts. First produced by Diaghilev, 
M,i\ r, 1926 al Monte Carlo, the music was by Constant 
Lambert, and the choreograph) by Bronislava Ni- 
jinska. Serge Lifar danced Romeo. Ernst and Miro 
each created a backdrop plus minor scenic additions. 
In the June 15 issue of La Revolution Surrialiste 
Aragon and Breton wrote a small notice. "Protesta 
tion." a&lt; ( using Ernsl and Miro of debasing Sur 
realism by their participation in bourgeois 
entertainment. 

2 In a letter from Rimbaud to Demeney, ([noted in 
Bizarre, uos. 21-22, I'M, I . p. 27. i n. I. 



The image of the vagina as a radiating lozenge also has 
a long history within Miro's art. where the genitalia are 
given a variety of associations. In The Family the vagina 
is show r n as a tuber with roots sprouting from it. In The 
Harlequin's Carnival. 1924-25. (D. 101), it is a spider 
with ray-like legs. The Kiss generalizes it to an ovoid 
with flames shooting out from it (see cat. no. 6). In other 
works this image is simplified to a point with lines 
radiating from it to form a star, as in Painting. 1925 
(cat. no. 17), or a web. as in fig. 53. 

Sketches (fig. 52). which Miro made in the late 1940s 
in Spain relate this image of sexual excitement and 
emotional vibrancy to the corrida or bullfight. Miro's 
notations on the sketches begin : "Look at the fence : on 
which diverse signs are interpreted in a magic way." 
Making visual and verbal notes of what he sees. Miro 
draws the flaming heart at the bottom of one page and 
writes above it : "the spectators clapped all together as 
though with a single heart : put a large heart on the 
canvas." On another page he draws the full heraldic 
image of the Romeo et Juliette painting and writes above 
and below it : "The heart that 1 say to place in the middle 
of the area is joined to a feminine sex vibrating with 
passion. Give a greater importance to this idea : unify the 
whole work without creating any breaks: define its 
continuity well."

The first poem in Eluard's collection Repetitions, 1922, 
is titled "L'Invention." The image of sand occurs in this 
poem to signify the passage of time ‚Äî an association used 
frequently by Surrealist poets. As well, Eluard speci- 
fically links his image of sand to the four natural 
elements, and thus to the landscape. Because "Sable" also 
seems to symbolize the four elements (see p. 51 above) 1 
within a shifting ground, which itself essentializes 
the idea of transformations, painting and poem are 
enlightening when seen together. 

See cat. no. 24, for another example. 



1 It is interesting to note in this connection that Masson 
whose studio was next to Miro's at 45, rue Blomet, 
painted a work called Les Quatre elements in 1924. 
the time of his closest friendship with Miro.

Other pictures like this Circus Horse are more remote. 
implying a spiraling recession into space blocked by the 
patch of white ground. The shape of the ring seems to be 
gh en by this spiral, along with details that simultane- 
ously suggest the ring-master's whip. The spiraling 
movement through space, with is suggested by several 
of the circus horse paintings which Miro did at this time, 
may as well refer to the path of the horse running 
around the ring, circling the trainer who stands in the 
center.

The apocryphal title of this painting alludes to children 
buying balloons on the Champs-Elysees and taking them 
to play in the Tui lories. Therefore, one reading of I Ik - 
motifs is a red kite and a white balloon floating in the 
sky, and the green of theTuileries gardens in the distance 
below. 

However, in 1926, it is difficult to imagine Miro depict 
ing such a simple subject. Furthermore, balloons were 
endowed with metaphorical overtones during this period, 
in relation to a crucial term of reference for the Surre-

a I ist movement: Guillaume \ poll ma ire's Les Mamelles 
de Tiresias, first produced in Paris on June 24, 1917. ' 

In the play Les Mamelles de Tiresias.. the heroine 
Therese decides todh est berself of her feminine "charms" 
in order to lead a man's life. Opening her blouse, she 

nd eases two balloons: one blue, one red. attached to her 
torso by strings. She jiggles them and "makes them 
dance"-' and finally cuts them from herself, to take on 

the male identity of Tiresias. 

Proof that Therese's "charms" were readily associated to 

children's hallons is provided by the following passage 
from a poem by Pierre Albert Bird published in SIC in 

\pril l ( )l8:-' !

Beginning in The Tilled. Field and continuing in Head of 
a Catalan Peasant, M in'i worked with a lamKi ape space 
explicitly dh ided into four strongly indicated quadrants. 
This division occurs again here : the north-to-south axis 
indicated by the flagpole and the edge of the patch of 
sea : the east to-west axis given by the horizon line. Each 
of the quadrants has a very particular character. The 
lower right is the site of .M iro's signature which rhymes 
with the mountainous terrain of the earth (particularly 
the "M"). The upper right carries the suspended white 
form of the "grasshopper" (whose bodv terminates in an 
enormous foot) and the unfurled flags. In the upper left 
is an erotically charged image : a volcanic sun with 
flames erupting from it. on which there appears the 
ladder frequently associated in these landscapes with 
movement into distance. The lower left is primarily the 
region of the sea. As w-as the case with "Sable" these 
quadrants each contain a particular mode of description 
(some symbolic, some ideogrammatic, some more depic- 
tive), and each is associated with one of the four elements, 
earth, air, fire and water (see cat. no. 21).

\s we ha\ e seen ( pp. 58 59) "/ n oisfilli . . ." is Mir6's 

must calligrammatic tableau poeme of the twenties. One 
nl \|)ollinaire's own calligramm.es may have been in 
\1 nil's mind when he executed this painting : "telegraphef 
oiseau qui laisse lumber ses ailes partout" (see fig. 29), 
organized visualrj as the image of a bird in flight. The 
phonetic and visual similarity of Apollinaire's "laisse" 
tn M nil's "baisse" may be significant in ha\ ing in spiced 
Miro to do a calligrammatic painting on this subject. 

There are further frames of reference in which this 
painting may be considered. At first glance, the central 
visual motif around the word a poursuit n evokes Arp's 

string paintings begun as early as 1925 ‚Äî 24 (e.g. Dancer. 
1 ''2 &gt; 2 I. string and oil on canvas). On closer examina 
tion, one realizes that in Mini's painting the motif 
consists of a flow of oil paint applied directly from the 
tube. Nonetheless, in spite of a different medium, the 
mode of composition and the visual effect are comparable 
to those works by Arp. 

Although it is hard to determine exactly when Miro and

an active member of the I )ada movement, Aip partici- 
pated in the International Dada Exhibition in Paris in

a participant as well.

\ It hough this painting is sometimes referred to as 
Landscape with Rabbit and Flower. Miro himself has 
identified the white form on the stem as an egg. 1 A 
similar egg shaped form appears on a stem in the 1 924 
drawing Woman and Insects (fig. 53). In this drawing 
a halo of dots surrounds the egg form, which serves as 
the head of the female, from this head arc five lines. The 
stem is crossed by a horizontal line with a flower and a 
leaf at either end. Lower down on the stem six radiating 
lines form a spider web. In this context, the leaf and 
flower double as the woman's breasts and the web as her 
genitals ‚Äî a variation on the more common association 
in M iro s art of the female genitals as a spider (see cat. 
no. 2). The head flower egg appears in many different 
variations in these years (see cat. no. 55). In this paint 
ing. what is prominent is the extreme simplification of 
it to a modeled oval on a single stem. In discussing the 
Catalan Romanesque mural sources for Miro's develop- 
ment in the early 1920s. R. T. Doepel cites the ""flow- 
ering rod" motif where the Tree of Life is simplified to 
a circle on a shaft (fig. 25). 2 The connection between the 
vgg form and the notion of a life-source appears else- 
where in the years 1924-25. In The Hunter (cat. no. 2). 
for instance, the figure of the hunter is formed by a 
crossed-axis like the flowering plant in the drawing. 
Similarly one finds in both figures the modeled egg 
shape with curved lines sprouting from its side. In this 
figure, however, the form is clearly the genitals of the 
hunter. The identification of the egg form with repro- 
ductive organs occurs again in The Hunter: in the lower 
region of the fish in the picture's foreground. From both 
Miro's testimony and from evidence internal to his work, 
one can see that to identify the right hand image in this 
Landscape simply as a flower is to strip it of much of its 
meaning. For a discussion of the formal aspects of the 
painting see p. 57.

animal was drawn as simply the head of a rabbit.

Jacques Dupin describes this painting as consisting of 
"nothing but a single odd creature, meticulously painted 
in several colors, apparently fascinated by the spiral path 
of a comet. All the rest is sk\ or earth, the purplish red 
of the latter and the orange of the former presenting an 
especially intense contrast." 1 The formal relationships in 
tli is work ‚Äî between the color planes of the ground, and 
tin' effect of the white shape on that ground ‚Äî are similar 
to those of Landscape (cat. no. 26) discussed on page 37 
abo\ e. As well, the two works probably share a similar 
kind of content : a strange isolated animal transfixed b\ 
an apparition of female sexuality. For just as the second 
(dement in cat. no. 2(&gt; summarizes fecundity in one stark 
image before which the animal bows, the spiral form in 
Landscape ' The Hare) may well be a representation of 
the dazzle of evanescent fantasy. 

In a painting of 1925 which Miro himself titled Lady 
Strolli?ig on the Ramblas in Barcelona (D. 148), one sees 
one of the most straightforwardly eroticized of Miro's 
images of women. Above the sensuous body, the head 
erupts as a dotted spiral ‚Äî very like the spiral in this 
Landscape. Although there are many spirals in Miro's 
work at this time, no two so closely resemble one another 
as these. Because Landscape (cat. no. 26) and this Land 
scape compositionally seem to be almost pendants for 
one another, one wonders if they are not thematically 
paired as well.

M Lro described the pretext of this painting to Sir Roland 
Penrose as an evening walk with his friends Michel 
Leiris and Georges Bataille as they were returning along 
the Seine from a concert. Penrose goes on to say "It is an 
eloquent image of aural and \ istial emotions in which 
trees take the shape of spiral waves of music, an early 
experiment in the translation of music into plastic signs 
which in later years has become an exl raordinary feature 
(il M irn's language." 1 In the c on lex t of the "magnetic 
field" paintings, this work reads as an e\ oca t ion of the

concept of "/&lt;/ glace satis tain" (see page 15 above). The 
painting holds three levels of depth within its ground : 
inside the painting, the watery depths of the darkened 
river; on the painting's surface, the glittering reflections 
of stars (which form spirals) and of the moon : and on 
this side of the surface, the consciousness of the speaker/ 
writer applying the inscription to it. It is an inscription 
which st.ites M irn's own being : Music, the Seine. 
Michel, Bataille and myself. Like the unsilvered mirror 
of Lcs Champs magnitiques, the work simultaneously 
opens onto a space beyond itself and declares the opacity 
of the medium pointing to its surface through the act 
of writing.

Idiomatically, "beaucoup &lt;/&lt;' monde" means "lots of 
people." But as in most of the work of this period, there 
is a conspicuous absence of human presence in this paint- 
ing, as indeed there is an absence of any physical object 
to block the flow of its space. Instead there is a sense of 
the vastness or plethora of open space : literally "beau 
coup de monde," or "a lot of the world." This sense of 
space, given by the movement of the eye into the illusion - 
istic depth of the painting, is generated by color and by 



the significance of the signs the work contains. Miro, in 
conversation with the authors, has identified the Stacked 
parallel lines at the top of the picture as a sign for clouds. 

The arrow with its flat blade resembles the blades on 
Majorcan windmills. Within the painting it seems to 
serve not only as a conventional sign for direction 
through space, but to operate visually as the horizon 
line that appears with such frequency throughout these 
works.

This painting is based on the crossed axial structure which 
occurs repeatedly in the work of 1925-27. "Amour" 
(fig. 17), u Le corps de ma brune . . ." (cat. no. 15) and 
Head of a Catalan Peasant (cat. no. 9) represent only a 
few of the many examples, in which Miro uses the 
crossed axes to represent the body and outstretched arms 
of a standing figure. Because of this, and because of the 
presence of a rectangle of black which overlaps the "arm" 
in Painting, this work has acquired the name Le Toreador 
‚Äî a reading which identifies the black shape as the 
figure's cloak. However Miro has voiced strong objec- 
tions to this title, feeling no doubt that it involves the 



work in an interpretation which is too literal, congealing 
its free-floating elements into a static whole and imply- 
ing physicality. Because of the capacitv built into the 
crossed axial configuration for the arms to separate from 
the body of the figure and to read as the horizon line of 
a deep space (see pp. 18‚Äî20 above), this configuration 
works in a way that is formally quite complex. The 
presence of the black rectangle intensifies this complex- 
ity, for it becomes a kind of cast shadow of the rectangular 
picture format as a whole ‚Äî appearing as a projection of 
the painting's surface backward into the deep space of 
the work.

Tlie device of black clots connected by fine lines to form 
a splayed "M" is related to Landscape (The Grasshopper) 
(cat. no. 24). There the distant mountains are volcanic 
with black dots representing their peaks. Below is the 
large "M" of Miro's signature echoing the shape of the 
mountain range. In Painting, a tension is set up between 
the flat, decorative quality of dots strung along the black 
lines and the implication of landscape and therefore of 
distance. This same configuration of bent line and dot. 
implying the same tension between surface and space, 
occurs in Circus Horse (cat. no. ~&gt;4).

The raw canvas field of this painting implies the open space 
of the landscape, within which Miro has set a modeled 
circular form atop a vertical stem. In the context of the 
imagery of these years, this form with its white halo, is 
easily read as a doubling of flower and female figure. 
This egg-shaped flower occurs earlier in a 1924 drawing, 
Woman and Insects (fig. 55), where it is much more 
legible as the head of the female figure. In The Trap of 
1924 (D. 95), a round head atop a stalk is again depicted 
as a flower, although the figure in The Trap is clearly 
masculine. Another 1924 drawing (fig. 50) repeats this 
situation of stalk supporting the figure's head, except that 
here the female head is elaborated into the delicate petals 
and stamen of the hibiscus. For the general significance 
of this motif, see cat. no. 26.

In L927 a miniature scale circus became the fascination 
of the Mont pa masse art world. It was the invention of 
Alexander Calder who performed it in his studio from 
1 927 to L930. Whether or not the large number of circus 
pictures w hich Miro did in 1927 were painted under 
this new impetus, Calder's circus is certainly sympto- 
matic of the intense delight the Surrealists took in the 



circus. In this painting by Miro the absorption of the 
figure and the linear element next to it ‚Äî both of them 
white ‚Äî into the space of the field is characteristic of 
Miro's treatment of images within landscape in 1927 
(see pj). ~)7-58). This treatment allowed Miro to expand 
the field to an unprecedented size.

From 1922 to 1927, Miro's Paris studio was at 45, rue 
Blomet. The house across the street was number 48. As 
in other cases where Miro signified an object by paint- 
ing the sparsest of its attributes, he has here designated 
the house by means of its symbol. The number "48" acts 
not only as a forceful graphic sign on a field, but is full 
of allusive meaning to the artist, evoking at once a real 
object and the emotional landscape of a definite period 
of his life. 



In the upper right is the familiar (but always enigmatic) 
spider-female-genitals-sun symbol. 

Miro's use of numbers in this painting is comparable to 
The Siesta (cat. no. 13) in which the figures have a meta- 
phorical meaning. However, in late paintings such as the 
series Letters and Numbers Attracted by a Spark (cat. no. 
55-57), letters and numbers are used differently : as a 
constellation of linguistic signs and phonetic sounds in 
space.

1 1 is often said that in 1928-29, Mini abandoned paint- 
ing. This is not altogether true : there exist enough major 
paintings of the period to prove the contrary. However, 
lie did return to a more concrete mode of expression in 
his paintings, at the same time becoming interested in 
constructions and collages. 

Painting, 1950, as a unique example of a "magnetic 
field" painting from the year 1950, can onl\ he ex 
plained through its relationship to the papiers colics of 
I 929, where round monochrome disks (of sandpaper or 
colored paper) animate a contrasting ground. Unlike the 
generally more violent expressive idiom Mini adopted 
in 1950, the serenity and cosmic dimension of this canvas 
is reminiscent in spirit of the paintings of the twenties. 



As well, its formal structure anticipates paintings to 
emerge in the 1 960's (see cat. no. 60). Like the work of 
the sixties, the shapes in this painting do not directly 
depict recognizable images. However it would be a mis- 
take to see the work as an abstraction. Just as the titles 
of the sixties paintings tend to indicate the identity and 
milieu of the (dements within them, so this picture 
should probably be seen in the light of Mini's often 
quoted phrase : "For me a form is never something ab- 
stract; it is always the sign of something. It is always a 
man. a bird, or something else." 1

In 1956 Miro began to move into the large new studio 
which Jose Luis Sert designed for him at Son Abrines in 
Majorca. It was a long process which involved, among 
other things, unpacking a large number of paintings 
dating back to the very beginning of his career ‚Äî sub- 
mitting the painter to a private retrospective of his own 
production. In the course of this Miro seems to have 
become deeply re-involved with the work he had done 
in the twenties. In some cases he embarked on new 
works which recreated the melting, fluid grounds of the 
original "magnetic fields" (D. 916-20). Other work re- 
explored the possibilities of a rapid, impulsive kind of 



drawing that refused to serve as the contour for a phys- 
ical object (D. 921-25). In the case of this painting, Three 
Birds in Space, he actually reworked an open-field paint- 
ing from 1939, adding new signs and spots of color to its 
surface and redating it to bracket the two periods of its 
execution. The present structure of the work recalls 
"Sable" with the field loosely divided into four quad- 
rants, each the bearer of a particular type of sign or 
image. Although the explicitness of the earlier work is 
gone here, the type of line that Miro has scratched into 
the surface integrates the isolated glyph into a field 
irradiated with spots of color.

The series of three pictures called Solitude appears as the 
distillation of Miro's period of going back and re- 
experiencing his past which was initiated by his move to 
a new studio in the late fifties (see cat. no. 57). The 
grounds of these works are monochrome and atmos- 
pheric (white oil on cardboard) and tbe drawing is far 
more delicate than Miro's line had been in paintings just 
previous to this. It is as well a drawing which imitates 
the gesture of "writing, bringing to mind the role of 
ecriture in works like Landscape, (The Grasshopper) 
(cat. no. 24), and " Un oiseau poursuit ..." (cat. no. 25). 
The paintings of 1960 are the last ones in which Mire 
will allow himself the pictorial luxury of a sensuously 
atmospheric white ground. After this the white grounds 
become far more austere. They are stated simply as the 
surface of white primed canvas which challenges the 
artist to make his mark ‚Äî like the blankness of the white 
page which Mallarme addressed in the poem "Salut" 
of 1893.

With extreme economy these vast blue fields recapil 
ulate the structural inventions of the period 1925-27. 
In Blue I, two nearly symmetrical configurations, each 
with four black spots, are placed on the left and right of 
the field. The fine diagonal which splits the field in two 
also implies recession into depth, reinforcing the feeling 
of space introduced by the luminous ground. As in 
"Sable" (cat. no. 21), one feels that signs of the elements 
have been distributed on the surface and have then been 
set spinning into depth. The configuration also recalls 
the structure of The Siesta (cat. no. 13) and "Beaucoup de 
monde" (cat. no. 29). Blue II is an extraordinary play on 
the horizon-line paintings like Landscape (cat. no. 26) or 
the 1925 Painting (cat. no. 18), and anticipates the red 
panel of the 1962 mural (cat. no. 44). Blue III, the 
sparest of this series, recalls the elevated placement of the 
red peasant cap in Head of a Catalan Peasant (cat. no. 9), 
as well as the spatial implications of the black vertical 
line. The space of Blue III is close, as well, to Painting 
1927 (cat. no. 33) and to Painting (fig. 14). 

The very color of the ground in these murals ‚Äî bine 
also reflects the concerns of the work of the twenties in 
which the open blue field had particular associations for 
the artist. See pp. 60‚Äî62 above.

These two paintings are among the few in the exhibition 
which show precise examples of Miro's most typical 
ideograms : birds, a spiraling star, the sun and the moon. 
As such, they are more easily legible as depictions of 



cosmic landscapes. The white grounds are somewhat un- 
usual in the context of Miro's total oeuvre. Miro usually 
prefers more painterly grounds, claiming that they stim- 
ulate his imagination to invent images. These flat lumi-

nous fields are particularly successful in this pictorial

Metaphorically they evoke the pristine light of the birth

Like the landscapes of 1 ( )27 this 'work again juxtaposes 
high ke\ color with a strong horizontal division of the 
picture field. The composition is very close to the 1 ( I27 
Landscape (cat. no. 26), with the exception that the 
white lacunae or breaks in the field now carrj their own 
internal zones of color. The effect Miro achieves by these 
color patches haloed hy white is to subsume the red and 
blue spots into the green and yellow grounds. See pp. 
57-58 above. 



The Gold of the Azure can be seen as a kind of preparation 
for the slightly later Drop of (later on the Rose Colored 
Snow, (cat.no. 51). where the field is far more bare 
and the elements more sparse and starkly juxtaposed. 
Only one star appeals in the later work, instead of the 
three stars in this one. This work also sets signs for male 
and female in the foreground and the slashing line of the 
horizon at the picture's center. The Gold of the Azure 
uses heavy, gestural drawing at the bottom of the work 
and fine, pictographic drawing at its top. creating the 
same kind of continuum between ideographic and de- 
criptive line as one sees in Drop of Hater ....

The treatment of the horizon line with a delicate stem 
like sign extending over it at the far left is close to the 
red panel of the I 962 murals (see p. 57). But here the 
continuous field is white with a scarcely visihle change 
in texture just under the line of the "horizon." This 
sense that the intrusion of line disturbs the field into 
which it enters, causing a redistribution of the surface 
tension of the color or pigment, is similar to that in the 



most radically bare paintings from the mid-twenties 
(see pp. 35-34). But the change in the field here has the 
effect of absorbing or enclosing the line into the illu- 
sioned distance, imparting to the line the quality of 
having created a ‚Ä¢wedge into depth as well as into the 
literal surface of the painting. The predominant use of 
white further identifies the space of the world with the 
p rimed surface of the canvas.

In the early 1960s American painters like Ellsworth 
Kelly were making paintings structured on the action of 
figure-ground reversal. Two ingredients of these works 
were intense mat color and large, sharp-edged, emblem- 
atic shape. The effect of such painting was that shapes 
inside the picture field competed with one another for 
identification as figure. In Flight of the Dragonfly . . . , 
Miro uses the kind of hard-edge frontal shape and intense 



color oppositions of sixties American painting, yet insists 
on maintaining the continuity of the entire field as one 
uninterrupted fabric. To do Ibis be leaves a margin of 
white around the figures, allowing them to sink back 
into and be absorbed by the field. This is a technique 
which Matisse had devised in his own work of the early 
teens, when he was distressed by the way a shape of 
bright color, juxtaposed directly on an intensely colored

field, would appear to jump forward off that field. A 
further effect of these w lute margins at the edge of the 
forms is to fill the picture field with the sensation of 
daylight bathing the figures by creating an illusion of 
refracted light. In that sense the white reserved-lines 
carrj with them a certain symbolic naturalism which 
modifies the more abstract quality of shape and surface 
in this work. 



Reversing the color relationship of Hair Pursued by 
Two Planets (cat. no. 52). this work suspends a splash of 
green on an intense orange field. As in " / n oiseau 
pour suit une abeille . . .'" (cat. no. 25). Mini places 
graphic signs at the top and bottom of the field, suggest- 
ing a naturalistic recession bv making the lower one 
heavier and larger. In Drop of Hater . . . this relationship 
both unifies the space and creates a continuity in the 
mode of drawing bv assimilating the gestural arcs below 
to the pictograph of the star above. Because of this con- 
tinuity both become variants on the idea of ecriture.

This is one of Miro's most extraordinary achievements as 
a colorist. The drawing gesture is retained in the orange 
splashes which affirm the vertically of the green field. 
But the effect of drawing as figuration is negated by the 
chromatic absorption of line into the total luminosity 
of the surface (see pp. 17-19 above). 

The title of this painting reconfirms the sense that Miro 
is addressing himself to the emotive sources of his earlier 
work. Not only does he return to the theme of pursuit 
which he developed calligrammatically in "Un oiseau 
pour suit une abeille . . ." (cat. no. 25). but he evokes the 
image of hair which had come into prominence in his 
work of the 1920s. The painter Robert Motherwell re- 
cognized the importance of this image when he wrote 
an homage to Miro in the late fifties. After exclaiming 
about the unabashed sexuality that surfaces in Miro's 
art in his deployment of erotic organs in a myriad of 
interrelationships, Motherwell goes on: 

. . . and hair ! ‚Äî hair is everywhere, pubic hair, underarm 
hair, hair on nipples, hair around the mouth, hair on the 
head, on the chin, in the ears, hair made of hairs that 
are separate, each hair waving in the wind as sensitive to 
touch as an insect's antenna, hairs in every hollow that 
grows them, hairs wanting to he caressed, erect with 
kisses, dancing with ecstasy. They have a life of their 
oivn, like that Divine hair God left behind in the vomit 
of the whore-house in Lautreamont. 1 

The different kinds of hair in The Tilled Field (cat. no. 1 ), 
the hair in "Le corps de ma brune" (cat. no. 15). in 
"Sourire de ma blonde" (cat. no. 5) and in Head of a 
Smoker (cat. no. 10), the rhyming of hair with the way 
genitalia are depicted again and again, all of these in- 
stances confirm Motherwell's suggestion about the im- 
portance of this image for Miro's art.

That these paintings do have phonetic meaning, like 
poetry, is reconfirmed in a discussion by Roland Penrose 
of a painting of the same period called Silence : "In a 
recent painting the stencilled letters of the word "silence' 
are scattered over a large red patch in the centre in such 
a way that as we read them the repetition of the 'E' 



seems to evoke distant echoes echoes that are taken up 
by other signs that we find repeated with diminishing 
size into the distance." 1

To present owner 



The series Letter* and A umbers Attracted by a Spark 
illustrates se\ era! pictorial and poetic concepts which 
are pervasive throughout the exhibition : the image of 
rotation or gravitation around a fixed point ; the idea of 
a magnetic point of light (or star): the distribution of 
signs or constellations on a field, and the assimilation of 
the painting to a poem. 

The original titles of these paintings were Poeme ii Vac 
cent rouge, Poeme a Vaccent vert. etc. Hence their identi- 
fication as poetry is unquestionable. However, perhaps 
through his interest in concrete poetry and twelve-tone 
music in recent years, Miro's concept of poetry has heen 
transformed to a constellation of sounds and linguistic 
signs. 

Despite the imageless character of this poetry, a certain 
metaphoric quality remains. The central spark is the 
poet's soul which acts as the huh or matrix of poiesis, 
mobilizing the sounds and signs out of chaos and into 
some meaningful order.

In I ( )()t). M iro went to Japan lor a large exhibition of his 
work in Tokyo and Kyoto. While there, be was impressed 
by a visit to a potters' village where he observed the 
fabrication and decoration of ceramic pots. 

I n the Large Mediterranean farmhouse at his Majorcan 

borne, Son A brines, which Miro also uses as a studio. 
there is a pot which Miro brought back from his visit. 

The simple decoration is a thick black calligraphic sign 
like a |oosel\ looped or knotted rope. Miro has stated his 
interest in the discipline and effects of the Japanese 
calligrapher. One cm see that Words oj the Poet was 
exec uted in that spirit, as a free vet disciplined gesture. 



What is interesting to note in the context ol M iro's 
ou\ re. is the artist's concept of poetry in the sixties as 
a wordless gesture in a void. Whereas earlier the word 
was a com entional visual entity with e\ ocative pow ers, 
here the visual entity is simpl\ the intentionalitv of the 
at t of ecritui e which, reduced to the gesture of drawing, 
is to be understood as a word. Miro has reduced his ex 
pression to the minimum formal means which can still 
produce a tableau poeme. This is not parallel poetrv but 
a compound of words and visual imagery presented as 
pure rhythm and pure color.

It is almost impossible not to see this work as a kind of 
after-image of the 1925 Painting (cat. no. 18) in which 
a white dot appears as the solitary figure on a blue field. 
Landscape reverses this by suspending a dot of blue on 
a white ground. Whereas the earlier work created a 
sense of atmosphere by means of the unevenness and 
liquidity of the field, making the tiny indication of 
planet or star extremely precise, the later one keeps the 
ground completely mat and even. Only the star, with 
its slightly blurred edges, introduces a notion of natural 
light onto the stark whiteness of the surface.

PROVENANCE: 

The artist 

To present owner 



The title and the radical emptiness of this painting 
suggest that Miro was thinking of Mallarme and the 
poet's interpretation of the distant and impenetrable 
azur. 1 In keeping with this poetic reference, the man 
and woman are tenuous forms clinging together in the 
nothingness of human existence. From this void, they 
contemplate an inaccessible point of blue in the infinite 
distance. 

Although Man and Woman in front of the Azure is 
quite close in composition and motifs to Painting, 1950 
(cat. no. 56), it is entirely different in tone. In contrast 
to the voluptuous color found in the early painting, the 
late painting is distinctly ascetic. Despite this difference, 
the identification of the motifs in the late painting may 
provide some indication of Miro's intentions in Painting, 
1930.
