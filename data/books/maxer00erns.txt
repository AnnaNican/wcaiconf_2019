acknowledgments 



A retrospective exhibition in homage to Max Ernst, the great surviving 
figure of Dada and Surrealism, was long overdue in New York and in Paris. 
While considering such possibilities, the Guggenheim Museum was ap- 
proached in 1972 by Jean and Dominique de Menil, who offered their un- 
equalled Max Ernst collection for an American museum circuit including 
The Rice Museum, Houston, the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery and Mary 
Atkins Museum of Fine Arts, Kansas City, The Art Institute of Chicago and 
the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge. We seized the opportunity eagerly but 
proposed to enlarge upon the de Menil contingent with additional loans. 
The result of this transformation was the most comprehensive Max Ernst 
retrospective ever attempted. It consists of approximately 300 paintings, col- 
lages, frottages, sculptures and illustrated books, one fourth of these from the 
Menil Family Collection. The total selection occupies four ramps and adjoin- 
ing spaces within Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral structure. This exhibition plan 
was submitted to Pontus Hulten, the recently appointed Director of the De- 
partment des Arts Plastiques of the Centre Beaubourg in Paris, and promptly 
translated into a commitment to render analogous homage to Max Ernst 
by presenting the Guggenheim show at the Grand Palais in the spring and 
summer of 1975. 

A retrospective of such scope and importance engages extraordinary efforts 
and exertions within and outside the museum with which these acknowledge- 
ments can deal only in the most summary manner. Loans, funds and cap- 
abilities, each in full measure, are needed and their generous provision should, 
therefore, be part of this record. 

The lenders must be mentioned at the outset since the mounting of the 
exhibition is due, above all, to their generous cooperation. The Guggenheim 
is aware of the sacrifices it imposes when owners of important works of 
art, whether private or institutional, are approached for loans and, therefore, 
wishes to acknowledge with emphatic gratitude an indebtedness assumed 
on behalf of a large public. 

Crucial also for the successful realization of the project was the generous 
help received from the National Endowment for the Arts. The sizeable 
financial aid extended in recent years by that agency of the federal gov- 
ernment to art museums has made it possible to continue with programs 
that would otherwise already be casualties of inflation and recession. The 
Max Ernst retrospective is an outstanding example of the Endowment's 
beneficial functioning. 

The realization of the show and of the accompanying catalogue depended 
upon museum workers charged with many divergent tasks. In addition to 
curators, registrars and conservators, public affairs personnel, editors and 
photographers took part in this major exhibition effort and deserve at least 
generic credit wherever their identities must remain submerged. The central 
responsibility for the staging of the Max Ernst retrospective rests with Diane

Waldman, the Guggenheim's Curator of Exhibitions, and it is therefore in 
her, as well as in my own, name that additional thanks are herewith ex- 
pressed to the following individuals who have been particularly helpful: 

Lothar Fischer, Berlin, Giinter Metken, Paris, Eva Stiinke, Galerie der 
Spiegel, Cologne, for research; Timothy Baum, Charles Byron, New York, 
Jimmy Ernst, Easthampton, Jill Levine, Cambridge, Massachusetts, James 
Mayor, The Mayor Gallery, London, Benedicte Pesle, Galerie Alexander 
Iolas, Werner Spies, Paris, for help in locating works; Harris Rosenstein, 
Menil Family Collection, Houston, for aid in organizing and coordinating 
technical aspects of the exhibition; members of the Guggenheim staff: Sabine 
Rewald, for assistance in all facets of the preparation of the catalogue and 
exhibition, Carol Fuerstein, for extensive editorial work on the catalogue, 
Elizabeth Funghini, registrar for the exhibition, Margit Rowell, for generous 
help in translating, and Mimi Poser for help in selecting works in Europe, 
Nancy Aronson for general assistance. 

A final word of deep appreciation must be reserved for Max Ernst himself. 
His gentle presence and his deep concern could not but help and inspire all 
those involved in the preparation of his show.

My wanderings, my unrest, my impatience, my doubts, my beliefs, my hal- 
lucinations, my loves, my outbursts of anger, my revolts, my contradictions, 
my refusals to submit to any discipline . . . have not created a climate favor- 
able to the creation of a peaceful, serene work. My work is like my conduct; 
not harmonious in the sense of the classical composers, or even in the sense of 
the classical revolutionaries. Rebellious, heterogeneous, full of contradiction, 
it is unacceptable to specialists of art, culture, conduct, logic, morality. But it 
does have the ability to enchant my accomplices: poets, pataphysicians and a 
few illiterates.

max ernst 



Diane Waldman 



Rarely in the twentieth century has an artist come to represent, as does Max 
Ernst, the will to invent. Until recently, this is a role that has been pre- 
dominantly associated with Picasso, but with the passage of time attitudes 
have been accepted that would have been considered subversive even ten 
years ago. Both Picasso and Ernst were responsive to the drastic political and 
social upheavals of the nineteenth century and the concurrent change in 
patronage from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie, but they offer substantially 
different responses to these forces and alternative views of the art of the 
twentieth century. If Picasso is the heroic figure of the classical, rational 
abstraction of the epic years of the early twentieth century, then Max Ernst 
exemplifies those aspects of the countervailing movements of twentieth- 
century art in which the mysterious and irrational predominate: first in the 
nihilism of Dada, then in the lyrical dream-imagery of Surrealism. In an 
oeuvre that spans over sixty-five years and came to fruition between the 
two world wars, Ernst now emerges as the dominant figure of both Dada 
and Surrealism. 

For Picasso, objects, no longer contingent upon the demands of a hier- 
archical order, could be drawn from the commonplace existence of the cafe 
and the bordello; for Ernst, this form of reality was no longer sufficient. 
Instead it was in the prosaic reality of the mail-order catalogue and the 
scientific journal and the enigma of the dream that he found a new content 
for his art. While Picasso subjected the obvious imagery of the demimonde 
to the rigorous demands of pure painting, Max Ernst's transformation of 
subject matter into abstract form was only the prelude to the development 
of poetic metaphor. 

Ernst's ability to express a vivid interior existence while simultaneously 
opening himself to the larger issues of our time is reflected consistently 
throughout his career. The conciliation of contradictory forces, the expres- 
sion of the universal, was accomplished in the face of great personal tribula- 
tion, two world wars, an errant life-style and an unwillingness to repeat 
himself in his art. A highly cultivated intelligence and an equally formidable 
intuition, a ferocious wit and a penchant for irony were nurtured by the 
general ambience of both Dada and Surrealism but are, of course, ultimately 
inherent in the man himself. And it is to Max Ernst himself that we must 
turn for the initial clues to the reality of his existence as an artist. 

Philipp Ernst, an authoritarian figure, a devout Catholic and teacher at 
the School for the Deaf and Dumb in the town of Briihl near the Rhine, 
fathered seven children in rapid succession; Max, ne Maximilian, the second 
child, was born in 1891. An academic painter, an amateur in the best old- 
fashioned sense, Philipp Ernst enjoyed a local reputation and executed copies 
from the old masters for the convents and churches of the diocese. A strict 
upbringing and a demanding relationship with his father encouraged Max, 
at the age of five, to run away from home. As Ernst later related the incident, 



15 



he joined .i procession of pilgrims who, enchanted by his blond hair and 
blue eyes, saw in him the image of the Christ Child. Safely returned home, 
Max, to calm his irate father, insisted that he was indeed the infant Jesus. 
His father, himself the president of an association of pilgrims, succumbed 
to the idea of this miracle, and executed a portrait of his rebellious son, 
Max Infant Jesus. 1 

Several other dramatic events in Max Ernst's early life shaped his later 
development. At the age of three his father took him on an outing to the 
forest surrounding Briihl. There, to the child's astonishment, the density of 
the foliage transformed day into night. Exhilarated and frightened, Max 
retained a vivid impression of the forest. Subsequently the forest became a 
s\ mbol of night for him, and night assumed the mantle, as Novalis has 
stated, of "the place of revelations." When he was six, his elder sister Maria, 
with whom he had been very close, died, and death began to play a crucial 
role in his existence. In 1906, when he was fifteen, he discovered the death 
of his favorite bird, a pink cockatoo, at the same time his youngest sister Loni 
was born, and the linking of bird and human became indelibly imprinted in 
his mind. Forest, intertwined with bird, alternated as a place of freedom and 
imprisonment. Since these events have been recounted repeatedly, they have 
taken on legendary dimensions in all comprehensive evaluations of the artist. 
And the Surrealists, myth-makers in life and art, often deliberately choosing 
to obscure fact from fantasy, have exaggerated the fantastic aspects of their 
lives. Ernst, in true Surrealist fashion, cultivated his numerous nervous crises 
as an integral part of his creative existence. Nonetheless, we now know, 
in the light of twentieth-century psychological research, that childhood ex- 
periences of the type that Ernst suffered are a decisive factor in personal 
development. 

Imaginative and high-strung, in a state of constant rebellion against paren- 
tal authority, Ernst had painted since he was a very young child, but by his 
teens had not yet decided to devote himself exclusively to painting. Instead, 
after receiving his baccalaureate in 1909, 2 his family insisted that he continue 
his education, and he enrolled at the University of Bonn to study philosophy. 
There he wholeheartedly embraced the new esthetics taught by Wilhelm 
Worringer, whose essay Abstraction and Empathy had been published in 
Berlin in 1908, and developed an interest in abnormal psychology. According 
to Werner Spies, Ernst had read Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams and 
Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious in 1913. 3 He paid frequent visits to 
the nearby asylum, and planned to write a book about the art of the insane. 
These plans were, however, cut short by the onset of World War I. It is worth 
noting that Ernst conceived this project well before Prinzhorn's Bildnerei der 
Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally III) was published in Berlin in 1922. 
Ernst, an avid reader, was impressed by such diverse figures as Stirner, 
Nietzsche, Arnim, Holderlin, Novalis, Goethe and Doestoevsky and capti- 
vated by the fantasies of Jules Verne, the brothers Grimm and Lewis Carroll. 
The Book of Inventions, a compendium of applied science typical of those 
popular in the late nineteenth century which included diagrams of inventions, 
was among the books that made a deep impression on Ernst, and played a 
substantial role in his Dada period. Although his family preferred that he be- 
come a lawyer or doctor, Ernst, as he has since stated, carefully avoided "all 
forms of study which might degenerate into gainful employment." 4 Instead, 
he visited the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in nearby Cologne where he was im- 
pressed by the work of Caspar David Friedrich, Stephan Lochner and Al-

5. K. F. Ertel lists the following reviews by 
Ernst in his article "Max Ernst als Kunst- 
kritiker," Die Weltkunst, vol. XXXIV,

brecht Altdorfer, and continued to paint. To judge from the few works 
remaining from this time, Ernst quickly embraced the avant-garde. 

Two paintings of 1909, both entitled Landscape with Sun (cat. nos. 6, 7), 
reveal an artist in transition, vehemently attacking the academic tradition, of 
which his father's painting was but one example, rampant in Germany in the 
early 1900's. The tiny paintings, replete with agitated brushstrokes and hedo- 
nistic color, reflect the influence of Expressionism, in particular the work of 
van Gogh. The sensation of nature, however constrained by Ernst's youthful 
limitations, depends largely upon information conveyed by sign rather than 
literal description. The two oils are unique in Ernst's work in his emphatic 
renunciation of the great tradition of German graphic art, a tradition he later 
readopted in a series of frottages and collage-novels. Ernst's successful sac- 
rifice of line to a highly individual color statement lends these paintings a far 
greater authority than is usual for such early and obviously derivative work. 
At this point Ernst was still looking for an expressive or emotive context for 
his art; in the course of his search he turned to Manet, Gauguin, Goya, Macke 
and Kandinsky, among others. He rejected pure abstraction in his search for 
poetic metaphors for reality. 

Between 1909 and the onset of World War I, Ernst became thoroughly con- 
versant with the latest developments in the European avant-garde. He par- 
ticipated directly in much of the furious artistic activity in Germany. Die 
Briicke had already been established in 1905 by Kirchner, Schmitt-Rottluff 
and Heckel in Dresden. The Neue Kiinstlervereiningung was formed in Mun- 
ich in 1909 by Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Miinter; it included Campendonk 
and Karl Otten, the latter a student of Freud with whom Ernst became 
friendly. In 19 10 the influential periodical Der Sturm was established in Ber- 
lin by Herwarth Walden, a consistent and enthusiastic supporter of the avant- 
garde in Europe; in 1911 Der Blaue Reiter, consisting of Kandinsky, Klee, 
Macke, Marc and Jawlensky was formed in Munich; in 19 12 the famous 
Sonderbund exhibition, which included works by van Gogh, Cezanne, Gau- 
guin, Munch, Picasso, Kirchner and Heckel took place in Cologne and proved 
the decisive factor in Ernst's determination to become an artist. In October 
of 1912, Ernst published a series of didactic articles in the Bonn newspaper 
Der Volksmund on the "Berlin Impressionists," "Art and its Possibilities," 
"The Bonn Artists," "The Print Room," among other subjects. 5 He also took 
part in the Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon in Berlin in September 19 13, together 
with Klee, Kandinsky, Chagall, Delaunay and Macke, and participated in 
exhibitions with the Rheiniscbe Expressionisten group. 

In 19 1 1 Ernst met August Macke and formed a friendship that lasted until 
the latter's death in 19 14. Macke was extremely important as an artistic in- 
fluence and even more as an intellectual and spiritual mentor for Ernst and 
many other artists and poets in Germany. While Macke's domination of the 
Cologne and Bonn avant-garde is undeniable, Ernst's work of the period re- 
veals multiple influences: for example, a work like Street in Paris (cat. no. 11), 
191Z, in which the twisted angular distortion of the forms suggests Kirchner 
and the sharp diagonals of the composition infer the linea forza of Futurism. 
Although Ernst's production of this period is highly eclectic, which is hardly 
surprising given his youth and the variety of work to be seen in Germany, his 
primary allegiance to van Gogh remained effectively unchallenged at this time. 
In a painting like Railway Viaduct at Comestrasse, Bruhl (cat. no. 10), of 
1912, the blatant influence of the Dutch master is apparent in both the choice 
of subject, a faithful rendition of the latter's The Railway Bridge over Avenue

Montmajour, Aries, 1889, and its formal resolution. 6 Another facet of Ernst's 
esthetic concerns is revealed in the Crucifixion of 191 3 (fig. 1), now in the 
Wallraf-Richartz-Museum. In this painting, there is an obvious affinity with 
the Cologne Primitives, a part of Ernst's artistic heritage, especially apparent 
when seen within the context of this museum's rich collection of this school. 
The subject and the writhing, tortured forms of the figures refer also to the 
great tradition of German expressionism. Matthias Griinewald, one of this 
tradition's most important painters, may have provided Ernst with a direct 
model in his Isenheim Altarpiece crucifixion panel of c. 15 10-15. In 191 3, 
with the payment for this work, Ernst made his first trip to Paris. Although 
the trip was brief, it made a lasting impression and strengthened Ernst's re- 
solve to return there to live. 

The superb resolution of his Dada collages of 1919-21 and the majestic 
themes of the late 1920's were still several light-years away. For in 1913-14 
Ernst was still preoccupied with classical religious themes. The folklore- 
connected fantasy of Chagall and the mordant social invective of George 
Grosz, whose work he obviously knew, appear conjointly in Immortality, 
1913-14 (cat. no. 15), The arrogant father figure — perhaps a reference to 
Ernst's father — appears twice, in the life-like setting suggested by houses and 
trees grouped at the right and in the tomb-like ensemble to the left. Whether 
a personal memory or a premonition of the disaster about to overtake Ger- 
many, this painting is Ernst's most savage comment of the period on the 
human condition. The Chagall-like melange of figures, irrationally disposed 
upon the picture plane, is an embryonic example of the kind of developed 
juxtaposition of forms that Ernst used in the 1920's. The lush foliage that off- 
sets the intensity of the figure groupings might be read as an allusion to the 
forest of his childhood or a symbolic interpretation of the conflict between 
human and natural forces; it is prophetic of such later jungle fantasies as the

Between 19 13 and 19 18 several events appear to have had a profound effect 
upon Ernst's art. Macke introduced him to Delaunay and Apollinaire in 1913 
at his home in Bonn. Ernst was very impressed with Apollinaire — the poet's 
"Zone" had first appeared in the revue Der Sturm, and he had seen the first 
edition of "Alcools" in Mercure? with the Cubist portrait of Apollinaire by 
Picasso. In 19 14, Ernst met Jean Arp, with whom he formed a life-long friend- 
ship interrupted only by World War I. Macke was enthusiastic about war 
and accepted the Futurists' belief in it as necessary for the realization of a new 
order for humanity. Arp, unswayed by Futurist philosophy, fled Germany for 
his native Alsace but failed to persuade Ernst to accompany him, a decision 
Ernst later regretted. Conscripted into the German army, Ernst served as an 
artillery engineer. Wounded twice, he nonetheless managed to find the time 
to paint occasional oils and watercolors which were exhibited in 1916 at 
Herwarth Walden's gallery Der Sturm. Arp's influence dominates such semi- 
Cubist compositions as Landscape with Tower and Laon, both of 19 16 (cat. 
no. 13, fig. 2). Other forces are also apparent in his work of this period. The 
polychromy and the prismatic window-like configuration of the towers in 
Laon suggest the influence of Delaunay. Delaunay, in fact, painted a similar 
subject, The Towers of Laon (fig. 3), 1912, which was included in his one- 
man exhibition at Der Sturm, 8 an exhibition that Ernst must have seen. 

In 1917, Ernst published in the periodical Der Sturm 9 an article entitled 
"The Evolution of Color," as a tribute to Chagall, Kandinsky and Delaunay. 
While it differs substantially from Ernst's later esthetic position, it does offer 
insight into his thinking of that time, and it is remarkably prophetic of his 
Surrealist work in the linking of color with such images as the moon, the sea, 
the desert, the marriage of sea and sky as the symbol of the mind, and the 
importance accorded to plant life. Ernst said in this article: 



19 



Blue recedes toward the total death of space, black or the cold moon, the 
dead moon. On the earth the sea of a vanishing blue and the desert yellow 
with labor are dividing. Blue and yellow are the first apparitions in color of 
the colored totalities of darkness and light, the measureless sphere of the 
firmament and the finite sphere of the earth, the first formation of the primary 
colors, blue and yellow. Then the blue and yellow wedding became possible: 
green, plant, growth multiplied. The sea and the sky continued to be the 
symbol of the mind, finality the symbol of man. The first prayer of the plants 
as marriage} 

Interestingly, Malevich, although seemingly entirely unrelated to Ernst, was 
at the same time formulating a similar color symbolism of space. In the cat- 
alogue for the Tenth State Exhibition in Moscow, in 19 19, to which he sent 
his White on White paintings, Malevich proclaimed: "I have broken the blue 
shade of the color boundaries and come out into the white. Behind me com- 
rade pilots swim in the whiteness. I have established the semaphore of Su- 
prematism." 11 Even earlier, Malevich had stated: "I felt only night within me 
and it was then that I conceived the new art, which I called Suprematism." 12 
The parallels between Malevich and Ernst extend also to their fascination 
with aerodynamics, an outgrowth of their interest in Futurism's literal rep- 
resentation of the mechanics of speed. A passage in Ernst's article alludes to 
"The proud biplane which will link Paris and New York by means of its astral 
voyage." In speaking of Suprematism, Malevich said: 

/ call the additional element of Suprematism "the supreme straight line" 
(dynamic in character). The environment corresponding to this new culture 
has been produced by the latest developments of technology, and especially 
of aviation, so that one could also refer to Suprematism as " aeronautical. " 13 

By 19 1 5, the date now commonly accepted for the introduction of Suprem- 
atism, Malevich had basically defined his art. Ernst, twenty years younger, 
was still seeking his maturity as an artist. His Battle of Fish, (cat. no. 18), 
19 17 was painted the same year he wrote The Evolution of Color. One of the 
few surviving works of that period, it combines the symbolic marriage of 
primary colors with the floating form of the fish, an indication of Ernst's need 
for a dimension other than pure abstraction. In this and related works of the 
same date, the implication of the cosmic forces of sea and sky seems strangely 
at odds with the spindle-shaped form of the fish, a configuration that closely 
resembles the whimsical figures of Klee. The sensation of cosmos and the par- 
ticularized image of the fish are too disimilar to coexist comfortably. This 
kind of disjunction emerges more emphatically and systematically in Ernst's 
collages of 19 19-21, as for example in Here Everything Is Still Floating, 11 
(cat. no. 33), 19ZO, which is closely related to Battle of Fish. The lyricism im- 
plicit in the earlier work relates not just to Klee but to Kandinsky, with whom 
Ernst professed a kinship. An even more direct illustration of the thesis artic- 
ulated in The Evolution of Color is Submarine Still Life (cat. no. 19), 1917, in 
which the symbolic relationship of form and color exists in as abstract a com- 
position as Ernst created in this period. Passages in the painting are extraor- 
dinarily similar to Kandinsky's abstract compositions of 1913-14. Certain 
motifs, such as the phallic form at the right and the circular element at the top, 
prefigure Ernst's later Dada and Surrealist imagery. 

After the war, Ernst returned to Cologne, where, in October 1918, he mar- 
ried his former schoolmate, Louise Strauss, and resumed his art activities full

time. A son, Ulrich (the painter Jimmy Ernst), was born in 1920. Ernst quickly 
became an ardent advocate of Dada, then the rage in Zurich and Berlin. The 
political nature of the Dada activities in Cologne differed substantially from 
the spirit of its parent movement in Zurich. The first Dada group, formed in 
Zurich in 1916, was made up of such charter members as Arp, Hugo Ball, 
Richard Huelsenbeck, Marcel Janco and Tristan Tzara. The Cabaret Vol- 
taire, which became the headquarters of the new movement, featured theater, 
the visual arts, readings and musical events in an atmosphere filled with rauc- 
ous and often irrational "happenings." Berlin Dada, founded in 1918, was 
formed by a more radical, pro-Communist group, totally committed to polit- 
ical action, that consisted of George Grosz, John Heartfield, Raoul Haus- 
mann, Johannes Baader, and the aforementioned Huelsenbeck. In Hanover, 
Schwitters practiced his own form of Dada, producing from 1919, a series of 
Merz collages and the first of his constructions. The Cologne branch, founded 
the next year, combined both political and art activities. It was spearheaded 
by Ernst and Alfred Griinewald, whose pseudonym was Johannes Theodor 
Baargeld, who often collaborated in making collages as well as producing in- 
dividual Dada objects. Ernst has said of the general spirit of Cologne Dada: 

Contrary to general belief, Dada did not want to shock the bourgeoisie. They 
were already shocked enough. No, Dada was a rebellious upsurge of vital 
energy and rage; it resulted from the absurdity, the whole immense Schwein- 
erei of the imbecilic war. We young people came back from the war in a state 
of stupefaction, and our rage had to find expression somehow or other. This 
we did quite naturally through attacks on the foundations of the civilization 
responsible for the war. . . . Our enthusiasm encompassed total revolution. 1 ^ 

The pervasive anarchy in post-war Germany encouraged Ernst's interest in 
radical politics and he became friendly with Baargeld, a young Communist 
sympathizer with whom he edited the inflammatory magazine Der Ventilator. 
Baargeld, the son of a wealthy banker, was more interested in action and liter- 
ary scandal than in art. Der Ventilator, whose tone was one of extreme vio- 
lence, was directed at the working classes and was distributed in the streets 
and at factory gates. The magazine sold 20,000 copies before the British army 
of occupation in the Rhineland banned it. Ernst and Baargeld, joined by Arp, 
founded the Cologne branch of Dada which they called the Zentrale W/3 
(Zentrale Weststupidien/3) and began to distribute the short-lived periodicals 
Bulletin D and die schammade. 

Cologne Dada, as an organized movement, closed with a sensational event 
in 1920, held in the courtyard of a beer hall, the Brasserie Winter. The second 
of such events (the first had taken place in 1919), it was called Dada- 
Vorfruhling ("Dada Early Spring"). As Max Ernst has described it: 

Entry effected through a room reserved for "Gentlemen!' But a great throng 
nevertheless. Poster: "There is the beloved Dada Baargeld, there the dreaded 
Dadamax Ernst." Climax of the exhibition: Baargeld' s Anthropophiliac 
Tapeworm and Fluidosceptic of Rotzwitha von Gandersheim and Dadamax' s 
Unheard Threat from the Skies, Original Running Frieze from the Lung of a 
[Forty-seven year-old] Smoker and Bone-grinder of the powerless hair- 
dressers. Those works destroyed by members of the public in fits of rage were 
regularly replaced by new ones. Charges of fraud, obscenity, creating a public 
scandal, etc., were withdrawn after police interrogation of the accused. The 
exhibition was closed by the police.™ 



21 



Baargeld's offensive Fluidosceptic was an aquarium filled with red colored 
water meant to resemble blood in which floated an alarm clock, a woman's 
wig and a wooden female hand. A girl in a communion dress recited obscene 
poetry. Ernst also provided an object to which an axe was attached with 
which the public could vent its anger, which they did with a vengeance. The 
item seized as pornography turned out to be a reproduction of Durer's en- 
graving Adam and Eve. After this offensive item was removed the police per- 
mitted the exhibition to reopen. 

The Dada movement was short-lived. Undisciplined and anarchic, the 
loosely knit groups in Zurich, Berlin and Cologne disbanded. Some of the 
participants regrouped in Paris under the aegis of the magazine Litterature, 
founded by Andre Breton, Louis Aragon and Phillipe Soupault in 1919. 
Ernst could not get the necessary exit papers and was forced to remain in 
Cologne after his colleagues had departed. 

Ernst continued to work with collage, a technique that was enormously 
influential throughout Europe but had assumed a new and vital role for 
Dada. Collage had been used in popular art in the eighteenth century and even 
more widely in the nineteenth century: for example, in valentines decorated 
with bits of paper and fabric, and boxes covered with scraps of material and 
objects such as buttons. The Cubist's papier colles provided the direct prece- 
dent for the Dadaist's use of collage. They consisted primarily of cut or torn 
papers pasted, in one layer or more, onto a pre-existing surface and were 
used in conjunction with drawing and painting. The papier colles themselves 
were frequently commercial papers that simulated the texture of materials 
such as chair-caning, grained wood or marble, and were often combined with 
newspaper fragments, sand and other elements of commonplace reality such 
as calling cards, matchbox covers and tobacco packages. These elements 
called into question the nature of illusion versus reality. In using these papers 
and elements drawn from ordinary life, the Cubists were also challenging the 
materials considered acceptable for high art, and this attack upon the hierar- 
chy of traditional materials appealed enormously to the Dadaists. The Dada 
artists were thus dependent upon the Cubists for the formal innovation of 
collage. However, Cubist and Dada collage differed substantially in both form 
and content. The irrational juxtaposition of images allowed by collage was 
seized upon the Dadaists who used it to form a new pictorial language. 

A pioneer in the development of Dada collage was Jean Arp. In Zurich, in 
1915-16, he produced a number of collages, resembling those of Picasso, 
Braque and Gris, in which he used printed papers, fabrics, any materials that 
he came across. The great importance he accorded to chance in his work 
stemmed from his appreciation of Zen and the / Ching, which emphasize the 
significance of chance in all events. Arp's collages fall into several categories: 
the "rectangles," of colored paper arranged according to the laws of chance; 
the papiers dechires of unused paper; and those composed from papers previ- 
ously drawn upon, which were cut up and rearranged; and finally, relief col- 
lages. Arp assembled his collages by tearing up paper and throwing the pieces 
on the floor; the configuration that occurred, resulting almost entirely from 
chance, assumed both a philosophical and formal significance. Crucial to Arp 
was the fact that these collages were impersonal, unaltered in their initial 
phase when the artist selected papers at random. However, a second stage was 
involved, both in these and in his related "automatic" drawings of the same 
period, a stage in which the artist consciously altered the accidental configura- 
tion of his materials until they achieved a level of completion satisfactory to 



2.2. 



him. In all instances, the process entailed two separate and distinct stages, the 
first of random or chance occurrence, the second of conscious formal resolu- 
tion. This double procedure influenced Ernst's Dada collages and also figured 
in the later development of Surrealism. 

Duchamp's combination of accident and precise planning preceded Arp's 
collages. In Three Standard Stoppages, 19 13- 14, for example, Duchamp had 
dropped three threads, measuring one meter each in length, onto a wooden 
panel. He then cut the panel into the shape of the strings and encased them 
side by side. This formula, to which he gave the name "canned chance," fig- 
ured prominently in later works. His Readymades of 19 13-16 were, like Arp's 
collages, altered found materials. In Duchamp's case the materials were util- 
itarian commercial objects such as bottle racks, shovels, urinals. Duchamp's 
"naming" of ordinary objects as art was a gesture designed to shock the 
bourgeoisie. It was a much more extreme attack upon artistic tradition than 
the Cubist's adoption of collage and was extremely important for the Dada- 
ists as well as later generations of artists. Together with Picabia, Duchamp 
spearheaded the anti-art movement within Dada. 

Although Ernst has said he was scarcely aware of the work of Duchamp, 
he was simply too important to Dada for Ernst to ignore. A work like Ernst's 
Augustine Thomas and Otto Flake (cat. no. 51), of 1920, for example, is 
very reminiscent of Duchamp's Apollinaire Enamelled of 1916-17. Ernst was 
able to transform pre-existing elements and the use of chance into his unique 
and brilliant Dada collages. In speaking of collage, Ernst has offered reveal- 
ing insights into the sources of his imagery, his methods and the operation 
of his unconscious: 

One rainy day in 19 19 in a town on the Rhine, my excited gaze is provoked 
by the pages of a printed catalogue. The advertisements illustrate objects re- 
lating to anthropological, microscopical, psychological, mineralogical and 
paleontological research. Here 1 discover the elements of a figuration so re- 
mote that its very absurdity provokes in me a sudden intensification of my 
faculties of sight — a hallucinatory succession of contradictory images, dou- 
ble, triple, multiple, superimposed upon each other with the persistence and 
rapidity characteristic of amorous memories and visions of somnolescence. 
These images, in turn, provoke new planes of understanding. They encounter 
an unknown — new and non- conformist. By simply painting or drawing, it 
suffices to add to the illustrations a color, a line, a landscape foreign to the 
objects represented — a desert, a sky, a geological section, a floor, a single 
straight horizontal expressing the horizon, and so forth. These changes, re- 
cord a faithful and fixed image of my hallucination. They transform the banal 
pages of advertisement into dramas which reveal my most secret desires. 11

Several of Ernst's works from 1919-20 bear an interesting relationship to 
Picabia. Such works as Ernst's Farewell My Beautiful Land of Marie Lauren- 
cin, Help! Help! (cat. no. 27), 19 19 or The Roaring of the Ferocious Soldiers 
(cat. no. 28), of the same year, are an obvious retort to Picabia's Mechanical 
Drawings of 19 15-17, which he must have seen either in Alfred Stieglitz's New 
York publication 291 (1903-15) or in Picabia's own periodical 391 (1917-24). 
In these and other related works, Ernst used printer's proofs and rubbings of 
objects which he altered by adding inscriptions or drawings. These and other 
works of this genre bear some resemblance to Picabia in their purely mechan- 
ical forms, in their resolute symmetry and in their absolute frontality to the

picture plane. The wheel-like motif in examples like Self-Constructed Small 
Machine (cat. no. 25), 1919, also appears in Picabia's This Thing is Made to 
Perpetuate My Memory and Reverence, both 1915. And, as Lucy Lippard has 
pointed out, Ernst's Katharina Ondulata (cat. no. 45), 1920, bears a strong 
resemblance to Picabia's Amorous Parade, i^ij. K There are, however, sev- 
eral substantial differences between the two works. In Katharina Ondulata, 
the starting point is a piece of wallpaper that has been so re-worked that its 
original fabric is relatively unrecognizable, but Picabia uses traditional mate- 
rials like board. Furthermore, the pastel color scheme is peculiarly Ernstian, 
one that Picabia would have disdained. Ernst, unlike Picabia, finds it nec- 
essary to humanize the visual aspects of the composition to the extent that 
it becomes a whimsical play on love rather than a determined effort to under- 
mine human couplings in favor of the machine. For example, the cog float- 
ing in the sky is like a moon — in a Picabia it would merely be a machine part. 
Ernst introduces landscape elements and forms reminiscent of human anat- 
omy. Picabia's work, however humorous, remains a fairly straightforward 
play on machines. The form below the cog — a mouth, a heart or a vagina, 
or all three — uncannily predictive of Man Ray's Observation Time — The 
Lovers, 1932-34 — charges the composition with a blatant sexuality. Whereas 
puns in Picabia's Amorous Parade, once grasped, can be understood com- 
pletely, Ernst's verbal and visual punning seems endless. 

Ernst's Farewell My Beautiful Land of Marie Laurencin, Help! Help!, 
which Uwe Schneede indicates was probably a reference to Laurencin's 
attempts to help Ernst obtain a French visa, 19 is preceded by Picabia's Por- 
trait of Marie Laurencin, Four in Hand (fig. 4), of c. 1917. The inscription 
on the Picabia, "L'Ombre d'un Boche," is an allusion to Marie Laurencin's 
husband. The latter, a German whose nationality created difficulties during 
World War I, was a victim of circumstances very much like those besetting 
Ernst when he tried to leave Cologne after the war. Another possible connec- 
tion is the fact that Madame Buffet-Picabia recalls that Picabia associated 
the liveliness of Marie Laurencin with the effect of a ventilator; Der Ventilator 
was the title given the magazine published by Ernst and Baargeld in Cologne 
in 1919. A further parallel can be drawn between Ernst's working methods 
and the technique employed by Picabia in the latter's Alarm Clock, of 1919. 
As William Camfield relates the incidents surrounding this work, "Arp never 
forgot the Zurich Dadaist's first meeting with Picabia. Picabia was disman- 
tling an alarm clock in his hotel room, and they looked on with delight as he 
dipped parts of the clock into ink, pressed them on a paper and finished the 
composition by adding a few lines and inscriptions." This drawing was se- 
lected as the inner cover for Dada 4-5 (Zurich, May 15, 1919). 20 Picabia's pro- 
cedure is like that of Ernst who, that same year, made a series of rubbings 
from wooden blocks that he found in a printing shop. Ernst, out of touch with 
Arp because of the war, first discovered that he was alive when he saw a Dada 
publication from Zurich on a trip to Munich. It could have been the issue in 
which the Alarm Clock was reproduced. In any event, it is apparent that by 
1919 Ernst and Picabia were moving in a very similar direction. 

In Katharina Ondulata and other related collages of 1920 Ernst combines 
mechanical and anthropomorphic forms in irrational juxtaposition. The 
images in The Hat Makes the Man (cat. no. 47), for example, are based upon 
hat blocks that Ernst saw in his father-in-law's shop. The interlocking cylin- 
drical forms clearly represent the hat blocks but also suggest the figure of a 
man. This suggestion is reinforced by the addition of a phallus-like protru- 



15 



sion from the mid-section of the main figure. The title reinforces the double 
meaning. In other collages titles are deliberately misleading; there is almost 
always a complex visual and verbal dialogue. Often the titles are extremely 
important in themselves as poetic, humorous elements. Ernst referred to them 
as verbal collage, which he described as: "What is a phallustrade? It is a 
product of alchemy, composed of the following elements: autostrade, balus- 
trade, and a certain number of phalluses. A phallustrade is a verbal collage!" 21 
The displacement of the object from its normal context was Dada's answer 
to conventional pictorial narrative. 

Between 1919-21, Ernst used book and newspaper illustrations from the 
late nineteenth-century which he combined into compositions whose ele- 
ments differ radically in scale. Ernst's use of engravings and photographs was 
not in itself an innovation for, by 1915, both Carra and Malevich had intro- 
duced pieces of photographs into their collages. However, Ernst took the 
process of collage one step further than anyone had previously done. Rather 
than disposing the fragments of collage as separate elements upon the pic- 
ture plane, as the Cubists had done, or allowing them to become a source of 
shock because of their mundane nature, Ernst created a unified image from 
the fragments and identified them as a single entity on the picture plane. In 
works like The Orator and Two Young Girls Promenade across the Sky, 
(cat. nos. 59, 34), of 1920, the illogical scale of the images produces a dis- 
orienting effect that has little to do with the seeming innocence of the in- 
dividual illustrations. The psychological ramifications of this procedure are 
enhanced by Ernst's skillful technique of manipulating his material so subtly 
that it becomes difficult to discern whether the work is, in fact, a collage. 
Technically, he achieved this by means of a fastidious method in which he cut 
and pasted as little as possible. Eventually he improved upon his technique 
by reproducing his images photographically, so that the cut edges were no 
longer visible. It is this invention, the photocollage, that constitutes his major 
technical contribution to Dada collage. 

Although unable to leave Cologne, Ernst, at the invitation of Andre Breton, 
sent a number of his collages to Paris where they were exhibited at the Gale- 
rie Au Sans Pareil, in May 1921. 22 The works were received with great en- 
thusiasm by Breton and his colleagues. The announcement of the exhibition 
lists the collages as follows: "dessins mechanoplastiques plasto-plastiques 
peinto-peintures anaplastiques anatomiques antizymiques aerographiques an- 
tiphonaires arrosables et republicans" above the caption Au-dela de la pein- 
ture ("Beyond Painting"). Of the fifty-six works in the exhibition, only twelve 
were technically entitled to be called collage. Ernst himself disclaimed the 
term and said of the other forty-four, . . . Aragon was right when he said, "the 
place to catch the thoughts of Max Ernst is the place where, with a little color, 
a line of pencil, he ventures to acclimate the phantom which he has just pre- 
cipitated into a foreign landscape." Maxim: If it is not plumes that make 
plumage, it is not glue [colle] that makes collage? Technically, Ernst used 
everything at his disposal: printer's proofs, engravings, rubbings, photome- 
chanical processes of reproduction, as well as more conventional materials 
such as pasted papers, printed matter and painted images. The exhibition in- 
cluded several of the collages entitled Fatagaga (FAbrication de TAbleaux 
GArantis GAsometriques), the result of a collaboration with Arp and Baar- 
geld. Ernst has said that he alone executed the collages, and that Arp and 
Baargeld only suggested the titles, a claim which appears to be supported by 
stylistic analysis. The participation of Baargeld, not usually mentioned in

connection with Fatagaga, is clearly indicated as such in the catalogue. 

Thus Max Ernst contributed to collage a more advanced technique than 
that of the Cubist papiers colles. He also brought to it a vast iconography 
far in excess of the narrow political and social imagery of the Berlin-based 
Dadaists. Much of his collage imagery reappears in his later work. The slab- 
like motifs of The Little Tear Gland That Says Tic Tac (cat. no. 46), of 1920, 
appear virtually intact in the cork strips of Dadaville, (cat. no. 77), 1923-24; 
they are transformed into the cylinders of The Forest (cat. no. 76), of 1923, 
and his later major series The Forest of 1926-27. Similarly, the wheel motif 
of several collages of 1920 surfaces as a sun in the same The Forest series, as 
well as in The City series of the late 1920's. 

The logic of proceeding from collage into three-dimensional constructions 
that had appealed to Picasso and Tatlin had led Schwitters to structure the 
refuse of his everyday life into his memorable Merzbau structures. Ernst too, 
moved towards the three-dimensional and produced several reliefs, only one 
of which, Fruit of a Long Experience (cat. no. 24), of 1919, is still in existence. 
Although Ernst did not meet Schwitters until the following year, this work 
bears a remarkable structural affinity to Schwitters' constructions, while 
capitalizing upon his own obsessive imagery. In Ernst's relief, the plus and 
minus terminals of electrical wiring appear to symbolize the positive/nega- 
tive, male/female relationship, subtly charging the work with erotic over- 
tones. One can only assume that the vertical member of the relief is about to 
penetrate the female V-shaped form of its partner. This same female form 
later appears in the painting, Of This Man Shall Know Nothing (fig. 5), 1923, 
an ironic comment both in title and image, on the mystery of the female and 
the myth of the Virgin. Furthermore, in the relief, the stippled paint scattered 
over the surface of the female form connotes semen/ seed, a motif that 
reappears constantly in Ernst's later works, such as Blind Swimmer, 1934, 
in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art. The emphasis on shock 
value and humor of sexual content in this relief of 19 19 was not new, for 
both Picabia and Duchamp had already elevated the obscene and scandalous 
to the realm of art. Dada force-fed the mundane, the prosaic and the out- 
rageous in a concentrated attack upon all forms of order in society, politics 
and religion — which it held to be the enemy of art. Dada's iconoclasm did 
indeed constitute an artistic revolution. 

The period 1921-24 was one of transition from Dadaism to the allied 
but quite different movement of Surrealism for Max Ernst. Interestingly, 
only Ernst and Arp among the Dadaists were able to survive this movement's 
death. Both Arp and Ernst had always been basically concerned with nature 
in all its aspects. It was this involvement with nature that allowed them to 
transcend the nihilism of Dada and drew them to Surrealism, which is a 
romantic reinterpretation of nature. As a Surrealist Ernst reveals another facet 
of his creative genius. 

Despite his excursion into relief, it is not a format Ernst continued to 
experiment with, nor one used much by the Dada artists in general, with the 
exception of Schwitters and Arp. The elevation of the banal and the common- 
place to the realm of art had been accomplished by the Dadaists, who dis- 
dained the traditional means of painting and sculpture, through the use of 
collage and the found object. Orthodox Dadaists largely eschewed relief 
because it was close to both painting and sculpture. It is only with the 
triumph of Surrealism in 1924 that we witness a definitive return to painting 
and sculpture. What Dada had undone, Surrealism remade, using the in-

tangible qualities of paint and canvas to convey the equally intangible realm 
of dream. Ernst produced two other works which incorporate relief elements, 
Dadaville, 1923-24, and Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale (cat. 
no. 84) 1924. A comparison of these two works with the earlier relief, Fruit of 
a Long Experience (cat. no. 24), indicates the parameters of Ernst's Dada 
work. All three reveal an artist in transition. In Fruit of a Long Experience and 
its now lost counterpart (fig. 6) of the same title and date, Ernst appears very 
much challenged by developments in relief of that period. The abrupt thrust 
of the diagonals characteristic of the 1919 reliefs relates stylistically to 
Schwitters, and he refers directly to the Russian artist Archipenko as well. 
As Schneede has pointed out, Ernst's inscription sculpto-peinture is probably 
a quotation of the term Archipenko used to describe his Medrano series of 
1912-1914. 24 Although Schneede feels that Ernst was uninterested in the real 
substance of the Russian's work, it is clear that Ernst's reliefs are similar in 
many respects to Archipenko's sculpture. Dadaville still seems primarily to 
reflect the Dada sensibility. It is basically a collage, although the use of cork 
lends it a greater impact than that of a pasted paper assemblage. The Dada- 
ists had investigated the intensely emotive value of unusual materials and ob- 
jects, and as Ernst evolved his Surrealist style he translated the tactile effects of 
such raw materials into oil paint through the use of a number of techniques, 
such as grattage, in masterpieces like Forest (cat. no. 121), 1927. Two Children 
Are Threatened by a Nightingale is a transitional work. It is proto-Surrealist 
in that Ernst employs a conventional painting technique to present an 
unabashed dream-image. However, his use of real objects — a cheap picture 
frame and bits of wooden construction — are typical of Dada. 

During the early period of his Dada investigations, Ernst had become 
aware of the work of Giorgio de Chirico which he saw in the magazine 
Valori Plastici. De Chirico's metaphysical landscapes of 1914-18, depicting 
the empty vistas of the great squares of Turin, had a profound effect upon 



19 




Ernst — before the Surrealists made him a cult figure. In Ernst's eight litho- 
graphs, Fiat Modes per eat ars (cat. no. 283) and the painting, Aquis Sub- 
meris (cat. no. 23), both of 19 19, he employs distorted, deeply recessed 
spatial perspectives and substitutes mannequins for figures, both character- 
istic devices of de Chirico. And the sense of enigma so convincingly conveyed 
by de Chirico reappears in Ernst's Aquis Submersis. De Chirico's universe 
is composed primarily of man-made objects; man himself is rarely present. 
In The Delights of the Poet (fig. 7) of 1913, the use of distant perspectives 
and strong cast shadows creates an illusion of isolation and silence, of still- 
ness and remote nostalgia. The series of Metaphysical Interiors, begun by 
de Chirico around 1915, contains stacks of carpenter's rules, T-squares, 
geographical maps, biscuits and candies placed in tightly sealed rooms in 
which one can occasionally glimpse windows or portholes. The hermetic 
space of these interiors is paralleled in many of Ernst's works of the early 
1920's, as for example, his Pieta or the Revolution by Night (cat. no. 74), of 
1923. Ernst, and later the Surrealists, drew from random juxtaposition of 
objects a new enigmatic, dream-like ambience suggested by de Chirico. 

Works like The Elephant of the Celebes (cat. no. 64), of 1921, or Oedipus 
Rex (cat. no. 65), of 1922, reflect the extent to which Ernst still relied, in this 
period of evolution from Dada into Surrealism, upon the methods of collage. 
In these paintings, as in the earlier collages, Ernst juxtaposes incongruous 
images. However, the reintroduction of color and paint on canvas endow 
these and other works of the time with an entirely new dimension. Ernst's 
paintings of 1921-24 — his proto-Surrealist phase — have been criticized for 
the brittle quality of their surfaces. It is possible to see in this surface 
quality, as well as in his color schemes, the influence of de Chirico. It is also 
likely that Ernst wanted to avoid a return to the academically skilled but 
facile paintings with which he grew up. Since Ernst was more than routinely

adept at painting techniques, it would appear that he purposely sought refuge 
from the seduction of paint because he was still involved with Dada's anti-art 
stance. Ernst's wariness of the surface quality of paint lasted well into the 
1950's; until that time he relied, with certain exceptions, upon the nature of 
his image and the various processes that he developed subsequent to his use 
of collage — frottage, grattage, decalcomania — as camouflage for his painter- 
liness. Certain of Ernst's figures are virtual repeats of de Chirico; the male 
face in the latter's The Child's Brain, 19 14, recurs in Ernst's Pieta or the Revo- 
lution by Night, and there is a striking similarity between de Chirico's young 
girl rolling a hoop in The Mystery and Melancholy of a Street (fig. 8), 19 14, 
and the fleeing child in Ernst's Two Children Are Threatened by a Night- 
ingale. Equally significant for Ernst's work, however, is de Chirico's distor- 
tion of orthogonal perspective, in which near and far distances are irrationally 
juxtaposed. De Chirico emphasizes the weight in the lower portion of the 
canvas to bring his subjects close to the viewer. Ernst learned from de 
Chirico's distortion and arbitrary tilting of the picture plane, which he 
echoed in works such as One Night of Love, (cat. no. 116), of 1927. But al- 
though Ernst employed this form of perspective to upend his image, he 
distributed weight evenly over the entire surface of his painting. Even at the 
time of his discovery of de Chirico, in 19 19, he wished to emphasize the 
over-all image and the frontality of the picture plane. Within this distorted 
perspectival scheme, in horizontal works, Ernst splayed out his images later- 
ally, emphasizing the horizontal, as in Oedipus Rex, 1922, and The Couple 
(cat. no. 67), 1923. In vertical formats he centered his upright image, often 
flanking it with vertical elements to emphasize the rectangle of the canvas, as 
in The Elephant of the Celebes. 

The influence of de Chirico spurred in Ernst in the early 1920's a return 
to a kind of naturalism. The forms Ernst created in this proto-Surrealist 



31 



period were less abstract than those of his Dada works. There is a sense in 
these Chiricoesque paintings of more contact with the real world than in 
the earlier collages, although this contact is irrational and enigmatic. This 
sense of enigma is reinforced by the elimination of vital body parts such as 
heads, the introduction of quasi-mechanical, quasi-human forms (The Ele- 
phant of the Celebes), hidden faces or figures (Long Live Love), hands that 
beckon mysteriously (Celebes), or figures practicing levitation (Of This Man 
Shall Know Nothing), or a couple who appear to be made of lace, but, de- 
spite this handicap, engage in animated conversation (The Couple). In these 
works he produced a world of the fantastic and the absurd — which led di- 
rectly into Surrealism. Their mysterious aura is not diminished when we dis- 
cover that the central image in The Elephant of the Celebes is derived from 
the form of an African grain storage container 25 , and that the wooden figure 
of La Belle Jardiniere of 1923 is a pun on Raphael's Madonna, La Belle Jar- 
diniere of 1507, now in the Louvre, as well as a reference to the store with the 
same name in Paris. 

Ernst and Paul Eluard met and became friendly in 1921 in Cologne. 
Eluard, impressed by Ernst's collages, selected several of them for the publi- 
cation of his volume of poems, Repetitions, and purchased the painting The 
Elephant of the Celebes. After fruitless attempts to obtain papers, Ernst 
finally entered France illegally in 1922. During 1923, he lived with Eluard 
and his wife Gala and decorated the interior of their house at Eaubonne. 
Buried under paint and plaster, the murals were recovered in 1967, in a 
state of pristine freshness with color, surface and image intact. The cycle 
of paintings which covered walls and doors present a magic planet in which 
fantastic plants, animals and humans coexist in blissful innocence. Painted 
for the Eluards' daughter Cecile, the level of fantasy in several panels, 
especially Histoire Naturelle (cat. no. 69), 1923, approaches that of Bosch 
and Rousseau without the darker levels of meaning that we associate with 
the sixteenth-century master, or the naivete of the latter. (In a characteristic 
re-use of title, Ernst also called his frottage series of 1925 Histoire Naturelle.) 
Ernst's presentation of fully volumetric figure parts together with exposed 
skeletal structure and flat or transparent forms in Reality Must Not Be Seen 
as I Am relates to such paintings as Woman, Old Man and Flower. This pres- 
entation calls into question the reality of the figure as well as that of the 
surrounding space. These skeletal figures seem to have been inspired by such 
works as Diderot's encyclopedia or the diagrams of Baldung-Grien (fig. 9). 

The most unusual panel in the house is At the First Clear Word (cat. no. 
70). The sexual symbolism reflects Ernst's preoccupation with Freudian 
psychology at the time. The framing device with the hand in this painting, 
as in Oedipus Rex, implies penetration or seduction. The two works in this 
respect appear to be symbolic companion pieces: the former representing 
female sexuality, the latter male. They are reminiscent in their use of win- 
dows, hands, and in Oedipus Rex in the bird heads, to Klinger's Abduction 
episode (fig. 10) in his proto-Surreal Fantasies upon the Finding of a Glove 
cycle, published in 1880. The erotic implications of this panel, however, are 
largely eclipsed by its formidable abstraction. Several features are particularly 
striking, it is one of the largest and structurally most austere works that 
Ernst has produced in a long and prolific career. The abstract nature of the 
work is not violated by the inclusion of plant, insect and human elements — 
the vertical thrust of insect and plants conforms to the rigidly rectilinear struc- 
ture of the painting. The flat areas of sky and wall predict much recent

color abstraction, for example Ellsworth Kelly's panel-like paintings. These 
areas are so powerful they have an object-like quality similar to that of 
Jasper Johns' targets, for example Target with Plaster Casts, 1955 (fig- IJ )- 
The object-quality implied in Ernst and made explicit in Johns' relief paint- 
ings is, of course, a manifestation of the Dada emphasis on the object. 

Surrealism was officially launched in 1924 with the publication of Breton's 
Manifesto of Surrealism. The brilliant group of poets and painters who 
rallied to the Surrealist banner under Breton's energetic leadership brought 
with them some of the practices of Dada and some of its members — among 
them Tzara, Ernst, Arp and Man Ray. While Dada was a spontaneous 
phenomenon and not a really organized movement, Surrealism was more 
doctrinaire. Though Dada had been basically an art of protest and an 
attempt to destroy the existing order, the Surrealists proclaimed a new and 
constructive faith, for they believed they could structure a new order in art 
and society. They felt that the unconscious was the essential source of art 
and set out to explore the recesses of the mind. Thus, like Dada, Surrealism 
was based upon the irrational. The Surrealists developed an art in which the 
formal and rational order of Cubism was replaced by an order in which the 
bizarre, the fantastic and accidental predominated and seemed to stem from 
unconscious sources. 

Breton, in 1924, defined Surrealism as: 

surrealism noun, masculine. Pure psychic automatism by which one intends 
to express verbally, in writing or by other method, the real functioning of 
the mind. Dictation by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by 
reason, and beyond any esthetic or moral preoccupation. 

encyl. Philos. Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of 
certain forms of association heretofore neglected, in the omnipotence of 
dreams, in the undirected play of thought . 



26 



The first issue of the official organ of the Surrealists, La Revolution Sur- 
realiste, edited by Pierre Naville and Benjamin Peret, appeared in 1924, 
proclaiming the importance of the dream. 27 Rene Crevel in the Surrealist 
essay, "L'Esprit contre la raison," said: 

/5 it not for the mind a truly magnificent and almost unhoped for victory, 
to possess this new liberty, this leaping of the imagination, triumphant over 
reality, over relative values, smashing the bars of reason's cage, and bird 
that it is, obedient to the voice of the wind, detach itself from the earth to 
soar higher, farther . . . O, wonderful responsibility of poets. In the canvas 
wall they have pierced the window of Mallarme's dream. With one thrust 
of the fist they pushed back the horizon and there in the midst of space have 
just discovered an Island. We touch this Island with our finger. 28 

Breton also stated his belief in the ultimate unification of two seemingly 
contradictory states, the dream and reality, into one reality which he called 
"surreality." 29 It was Apollinaire, a major source of inspiration to both the 
Dadaists and the Surrealists, who had in 1917 coined the term "surreal" to 
describe man's ability to create the unnatural. 30 

To rid the mind of preconceived ideas, to free words (and later objects) 
from the cliche-ridden contexts to which they had been relegated for so 
long, the Surrealist poets and painters employed illogical, always surprising 
and often shocking associations of words and images. The Surrealists felt 
that the function of the poet or artist was to communicate the immaculate

primary concept, as they called the moment of intuition, not by describing 
it, but by selecting the appropriate word or image as symbol, which would 
act as stimulus or irritant to the senses of the spectator. This, in turn, would 
arouse multiple images and emotions, differing according to the sensibility 
of each viewer but corresponding to the power of reaction to the magic of 
myths, parables and metaphors of the past. A basic device of Surrealism, 
the estrangement of the object from its normal context, had been an essential 
part of the Dada esthetic. At this time, the exchange of ideas between 
Surrealist poets and painters was considerable, with the painters heavily 
dependent on literary methods and images. Ernst felt that his procedure as 
a visual artist was the same as that of a poet. Later, in describing the working 
method of the poet Raymond Roussel he said it ". . . consisted of breaking 
up any text and taking out a series of images which led to an unexpected 
creation based on phonetic combinations ... If we replace 'phonetic combi- 
nations' by 'optical combinations' we arrive at the collage or the frottage." 31 
The Surrealists acknowledged that the poets Lautreamont, Rimbaud and 
Mallarme were their precursors. Breton, in What is Surrealism?, 1936, com- 
mented "In the domain of poetry, Lautreamont, Rimbaud and Mallarme 
were the first to endow the human mind with what it lacked so much: I mean 
a truly 'insolent' grace, which has enabled the mind, on finding itself with- 
drawn from all ideals, to begin to occupy itself with its own life . . ," 32 The 
nineteenth-century poet Isidore Ducasse, Comte de Lautreamont had formu- 
lated an unorthodox concept of beauty and created imagery astonishingly 
like that of Ernst and the other Surrealists. The following passage has often 
been cited as the perfect Surrealist image: "The vulture of the lambs, 
beautiful as the law of arrestment of the development of the chest in adults 
whose tendency to growth is not in relation to the quality of molecules that 
their organism assimilates, vanished into the high reaches of the atmo- 
sphere." 33 Lautreamont's most important passage, from the Surrealist view- 
point "Beautiful as the chance meeting of a sewing-machine and an umbrella 
on a dissecting table" 34 was generalized by Max Ernst to read, "the fortuitous 
encounter upon a nonsuitable plane of two mutually distant realities." 3 

In the researches of Freud the Surrealists found some ideal tools for their 
own experiments. They attempted to apply Freud's theories in the writing 
of automatic texts and the creation of automatic drawings and the analysis 
of their dreams. They improvised speeches and conducted investigations 
into the interpenetration of the states of waking and sleeping. Breton, in 
November 1922, published "Entree des Mediums," in which, according to 
Patrick Waldberg, he had introduced the idea of "psychic automatism," the 
"magic dictation" of the unconscious, at the sleeping sessions ("sommeils") 
or collective trances practiced by Desnos, Crevel and Peret. 36 During the so- 
called sleeping sessions, the ". . . subject went into a trance and like the 
Sybils of Antiquity, uttered obscure words. His friends then proceeded to 
question him and the strange dialogue that ensued was considered a model 
of true poetry, superior to all forms then in use." 37 The free association of 
images already practiced by the Dadaists was expanded and formalized by the 
Surrealists into their cultivation of automatism. Included in the second num- 
ber of La Revolution Surrealiste are the drawings of mediums and poets, 
strange photos and curious documents, and transcriptions of dreams and 
automatic texts. They differed with Freud when he took certain elements in 
dream interpretation as symbols of conscious life; the Surrealists accepted 
them as significant realities in themselves.

Ernst's Dada work of 1920 already exhibited Surrealist characteristics in 
their technique of execution as well as in their dream-like imagery. For 
example, two collages titled Above the Clouds Midnight Passes. Above mid- 
night hovers the invisible bird of day. Still higher than the bird the ether 
expands and walls and roofs are floating, (cat no. 40), and The Swan is 
Very Peaceful; It is already the twenty second time that (for the first time) 
Lohengrin has left his fiancee II it is there that the earth has spread its crust 
on four violins 1 1 we will never see each other again 1 1 we will never fight 
against the angels II the Swan is very peaceful 1 1 he vows hard to catch Leda, 
(cat. no. 35). The poetry of these titles is similar, in the free flow of asso- 
ciations and imagery, to that in Breton's and Soupault's The Magnetic Fields, 
published in 1920, which Breton called the first Surrealist work, resulting 
from the first systematic application of automatic writing. These parallels 
can be seen in the following excerpt from The Magnetic Fields: "The night 
that was gliding over his head came to rest on his shoulders. Ordinary fans 
were for sale; they bore no more fruit. People were running without knowing 
why in the direction of the estuaries of the sea. Clocks, in despair, were 
fingering their rosaries." 38 Ernst's imagery is, however, less concrete than that 
of Breton and Soupault. 

Ernst's relationship with the Surrealist movement is erratic — since he was 
not regularly in Paris and because he did not subscribe to all of its doctrines. 
He pays tribute to the other participants in the sleeping sessions in his paint- 
ing All Friends Together (fig. 12) of 1922. Included with the participants are 
Arp and Baargeld as well as Doestoevsky and de Chirico. He added Raphael 
as an oblique reference to his father who had once made a copy of the 
Renaissance master's Disputa. Ernst later articulated his reservations about 
the Surrealist group: 

7 think that even today I would subscribe to some of the basic principles of 
Breton's Surrealism, which also proclaimed spontaneity, in the form 
of automatic writing, for example. But how can one reconcile individual 
spontaneity and a group discipline dictated by an authoritarian leader? The 
slow disintegration of the Surrealist group, which was made up of strong 
personalities and which was rather homogeneous at its beginnings, was due 
to the impossibility of resolving this problem. The semblance of democratic 
methods tolerated by the leader was of no help? 9 

Frottage, a procedure which consisted of placing paper on top of a tex- 
tured element and rubbing a pencil or other media over this surface, was 
Ernst's personal response to the automatic writing of Surrealism. The first 
frottage, Animal (cat. no. 62), 1921, was a rubbing on the back of a telegram, 
done spontaneously. He did not, however, adopt the technique as a sys- 
tematic working method until 1925, and accordingly, he dates his invention 
of the procedure as 1925. Frottage permitted Ernst to move beyond the 
spontaneous improvisational aspects of automatism to a more calculated 
method with which to achieve the Surrealist ideal of merging two planes of 
reality. Ernst has cited the precedent of Leonardo da Vinci in the development 
of frottage. He points out the following passage in Leonardo's Treatise on 
Painting: 

Botticelli did not like landscape painting. He felt that it was "a kind of short 
and mediocre investigation." He says with contempt that "by throwing a 
sponge soaked with different colors against a wall one makes a spot I in 



37 



which may be seen a beautiful landscape." That statement brought him a 
severe admonition from his colleague, Leonardo da Vinci: 

"He (Botticelli) is right; in such a daub one may certainly find bizarre inven- 
tions. I mean to say that he ivho is disposed to gaze attentively at this spot 
may discern therein some human heads, various animals, a battle, some rocks, 
the sea, clouds, groves, arid a thousand other-things — it is like the tinkling of 
the bell ivhich makes one hear what one imagines. But though this stain 
serves to suggest some ideas it does not teach one how to finish any part of the 
painting. And the above-mentioned painter makes very bad landscapes. To 
be universal and to please varying tastes it is necessary that in the same 
composition may be found some very dark passages and others of a gently 
lighted penumbra. It is not to be despised, in my opinion, if, after gazing 
fixedly at the spot on the wall, the coals in the grate, the clouds, the flowing 
stream, if one remembers some of their aspects; and if you look at them 
carefully you will discover some quite admirable inventions. Of these the 
genius of the painter may take full advantage, to compose battles of animals 
and of men, of landscapes or monsters, of devils and other fantastic things 
which bring you honor. In these confused things genius becomes aware of 
new inventions, but it is necessary to know well (how to draw) all the parts 
that one ignores, such as the parts of animals and the aspects of landscape, 
rocks and vegetation} 

Ernst's own description of frottage is clearly indebted to Leonardo: 

On the tenth of August, 192 j, an insupportable visual obsession caused me 
to discover the technical means which have brought a clear realization of this 
lesson of Leonardo. Beginning with a memory of childhood in the course of 
which a panel of false mahogany, situated in front of my bed, had played the 
role of optical provocateur of a vision of half -sleep, and finding myself one 
rainy evening in a seaside inn, I was struck by the obsession that showed to 
my excited gaze the floor-boards upon which a thousand scrubbings had 
deepened the grooves. I decided then to investigate the symbolism of this 
obsession, and, in order to aid my meditative and hallucinatory faculties, 
1 made from the boards a series of drawings by placing on them, at random, 
sheets of paper which I undertook to rub with black lead. In gazing atten- 
tively at the drawings thus obtained, "the dark passages and those of a gently 
lighted penumbra," I was surprised by the sudden intensification of my 
visionary capacities and by the hallucinatory succession of contradictory 
images superimposed, one upon the other, with the persistence and rapidity 
characteristic of amorous memories. 

My curiosity awakened and astonished, 1 began to experiment indifferently 
and to question, utilizing the same means, all sorts of materials to be found 
in my visual field: leaves and their veins, the ragged edges of a bit of linen, 
the brushstrokes of a "modern" painting, the unwound thread from a spool, 
etc. There my eyes discovered human heads, animals, a battle that ended 
with a kiss (the bride of the wind), rocks, the sea and the rain, earthquakes, 
the sphinx in her stable, the little tables around the earth, the palette of 
Caesar, false positions, a shawl of frost flowers, the pampas. 41 

In the frottages Ernst temporarily rejected the painterly qualities of his 
proto-Surrealist work of 1921-24. His linear emphasis recalls the graphic 
quality of many of his Dada collages. However, these frottages are more 
lyrical and curvilinear than the collages. The frottages of 1925, many of

which were grouped together and published as Histoire Naturelle, signal a 
clear break with the machine esthetic of Dada and reveal Ernst's renewed 
interest in natural phenomena. However, it is a new and special view of 
nature in which natural phenomena are transformed into images of potent 
cosmological forces. In this respect Ernst reflects the influence of Leonardo. 
The titles themselves, such as Fields of Honor, Flood, Seismic Plants, speak 
of cosmic symbolism. The symbolic imagery of disembodied eyes in The 
Wheel of Light and The Escaped is very close to that of Redon. Like the 
eyes of Redon, Ernst's eyes stand for inner vision, the spirit, the intellect. 

Some frottages cover the entire surface of the paper, others, only part of 
the sheet. Even the most complex of the images are done without any draw- 
ing. The image always results from the process of rubbing over objects. For 
example, rubbing over threads produces delicate lines which appear to be 
drawn. In many, multiple textures are used, the sources of which are rarely 
identifiable. These textures are metamorphosed into images which are always 
natural: birds, plants, animals, some fairly realistic, some strange and mys- 
terious. It is a transformation of texture into form which prefigures Dubuffet's 
imagery. The forms are taken out of context and often drastically altered in 
scale, thus heightening the sense of enigma. The works are Chiricoesque in 
that the forms are placed in a landscape without apparent context. Despite 
the use of a horizon line or hint of perspective like that of de Chirico, the 
space is very shallow, as in the Dada collages. 

It is fascinating to compare Histoire Naturelle with the work of Andre 
Masson and Joan Miro, whose mature styles appeared with the emergence 
of Surrealism. By 1925, Miro was producing his "Dream Paintings," of which 
Personage (fig. 13) is an example, and Masson had developed an automatic 
technique of painting with sand. Masson and Miro had become friends in 
1922 and had adjoining studios. Ernst and Masson were apparently never 
close but Ernst and Miro collaborated on sets and costumes for the Ballet 



39

Russe in 1926. Moreover, they shared many friends and interests. Miro 
greatly admired the biomorphic forms and pioneering use of accident of 
Ernst's close friend Arp. Both men were enthusiastic about Jarry, and both 
felt a kinship with the Surrealist poets, particularly Eluard. Above all they 
shared a mutual belief in the dream as a fundamental source of artistic 
inspiration. 

The work of Masson and Ernst is close in two respects. Both artists culti- 
vated automatism to a high degree and both experimented with unusual 
materials, sand for example, which in themselves suggested images. Interest- 
ingly, Masson painted a Battle of Fishes (fig. 14) in 1927, ten years after 
Ernst's work of the almost identical title. Masson rejected the rectilinear grid 
which characterized his analytical Cubist works in favor of an all-over 
meandering web of forms in the sand paintings. However, the imagery in 
these works seems as constrained by the sand technique as it was by the grid 
in the Cubist works that preceded them; he had merely substituted one rigid 
format for another. Masson very closely followed the dogmatic Surrealist 
doctrine of automatism, but did not take his imagery into the realm of free 
imagination as Miro and Ernst did. 

Ernst continued to employ the frottage technique after the Histoire Natur- 
elle series. In these works, there is a marked shift in emphasis from the use 
of many images to an obsessive concentration on the bird theme in which 
Ernst identifies himself with a bird. Dadamax is transformed into Loplop, 
the Superior of Birds. Although the obsession with this theme subsides after 
a few years, it reemerges from time to time throughout his subsequent career. 
This obsession is a recapitulation of Ernst's childhood memories and also 
appears to be a reference to Leonardo, whose fixation with a vulture was 
documented by Freud in his essay, Eine Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da 
Vinci of 19 10. Furthermore, the bird figures significantly in German myth- 
ology and the eagle is the German national bird. The bird stands for flight 



40 



and the fantastic and, of course, the intellect. Ernst's identification with the 
bird, representing the intellect, contrasts remarkably with Picasso's favorite 
symbol, the bull, in the guise of the Minotaur, which emphasizes the earth- 
bound forces of nature. 

The static figure-ground relationship that characterizes Caged Bird (cat. 
no. 88), 1925 and related works of the same year, was abruptly replaced in 
100,000 Doves (cat. no. 91), 1925, and Blue and Pink Doves (cat. no. 112), 
1926. Elaborating upon his use of frottage, Ernst developed a similar process 
with oil painting, which he called grattage. In this technique, he covered the 

fig- 14 canvas with layers of paint and held it over textured surfaces or objects

raised part of the canvas. Ernst then altered the resulting configurations by 

adding contours or details with a brush. The all-over imagery and semi- 
automatic process of these paintings represent a new departure for Ernst and 
prefigure the developments of the New York School in the late 1940's and 
1950's. Ernst says that the process of grattage uncovered images which pro- 
vided him with inspiration and helped him to overcome the terror he 
claims to have reh when confronted with a bare canvas. The formal and 
technical developments of this period were brought to fruition in 100,000 
Doves, in which Ernst achieves a level of painterliness virtually unique in his 
work until this time. The sensuous, velvety surface and the pale blue, rose 
and white palette articulate the entire surface in an all-over pattern which 
denies any of the spatial recession or spatial ambiguity usual in his work. 
The dense impasto of 100,000 Doves is in dramatic contrast to Blue and Pink 
Doves, also a key work. In Blue and Pink Doves, Ernst manages to create a 
seductive image with the sparest means, daringly leaving significant areas of 
the canvas bare. Ernst alternated between the use of heavy impasto and loose, 
open brushwork throughout the twenties. 

In the period between the appearance of the first Surrealist manifesto 
in 1924 and the second in 1930, Surrealism branched in two directions. The 
cultivation of automatism led to the development of an abstract variant by 
artists like Miro and Masson. On the other hand, the concern with fixing 
dream images resulted in a form of illusionism exemplified by Dali and 
Magritte. Ernst experimented with elements of both styles and cannot be 
classified under either heading. Like Picasso, he was able to alternate in a 
remarkable way between two artistic polarities. Although he never developed 
his illusionism as far as an artist like Dali, the more he emphasized the 
object-quality of his image, the less successful were his works. However, 
when he abandoned himself to the freedom allowed by techniques such as 
frottage, his more abstract works were more open, and by far the most 
brilliant of his Surrealist phase. Among the extraordinary works in the latter 
category are The Horde (cat. no. 118) and One Night of Love (cat. no. 116), 
both of 1927. They reveal the obsessive, nightmarish qualities of much of his 
earlier work. The empty eyes of the figures in The Horde impart a mysterious 
unease, implying the presence of irrational forces in nature. 

The period of the middle to late twenties was an extremely prolific one, 
in which Ernst produced works expressing many themes. His great thematic 
and stylistic range is seen as the dense impacted forms of The Horde open up 
into the curvilinear arabesques of One Night of Love. The labyrinthian maze 
has become a graceful skein that embraces the tender forms in these paint- 
ings. Certain works of this phase with half-bird, half-human shapes, like One 
Night of Love or The Beautiful Season (cat. no. 92), 1925, with its gentle horse, 



41 



reflect brief moments of tranquility. These lyrical works coexist with the 
horrific vision of The Horde. 

One Night of Love raises questions about similarities between the work 
of Picasso and Ernst during this period. The compact and self-contained dis- 
tortion of Ernst's Dada and post-Dada work has a formal symmetry that 
does not appear in his figures of 1917-28. In.One Night of Love the extended 
and abnormally large foot, to cite but one element, is clearly reminiscent of 
Picasso's monumental forms of the twenties. The use of multiple perspectives, 
derived from de Chirico, which Ernst had virtually eliminated in such works 
as The Horde, reappears in altered form in this painting. The head, dimin- 
utive in relation to the enormous left foot, implies deep spatial perspective, 
which is contradicted by the plane upon which the figure is superimposed. 
Many details, such as the circular and biomorphic forms and the bull's head 
are typical of Picasso's imagery. Ernst lends volume to form by outlining 
shapes with flat passages of paint, a modeling procedure characteristic of 
Picasso. The eroticism of the painting, expressed through the curvilinear 
forms and warm colors, as well as the subject itself, is more blatant than 
usual for Ernst. The graceful intertwining forms and the seductive color 
seem to reflect a Mediterranean temperament. However, the horned figure 
with its carnivorous teeth, which calls to mind African sculpture, is ominous. 
The supine female figures and the small, struggling bird contrast with the 
upright male form and emphasize its dark power. One Night of Love is 
unique in Ernst's oeuvre at this time, in that it encompasses both figuration 
and abstraction. Ernst successfully combines in a single painting the two 
tangents he had heretofore explored in separate works. Although the painting 
is formally atypical, its theme is entirely representative of Ernst's symbolic 
usage. The bird is the reservoir of multiple symbolic meanings: among other 
possibilities it stands for Ernst himself; enclosed within the intertwining male 
and female forms it appears to represent maternity and procreation. 

Chief among the works of this time in which Ernst turned to other, less 
demonic or obsessive images, the painting The Beautiful Season of 1925 and 
the frottage of the same title and date (cat. nos. 92, 94) are recapitulations 
of the earlier collage The Horse, He's Sick (cat. no. 32), 1920. A similar 
figure reappears in the 193 1 collage, Loplop Introduces Paul Eluard (cat. no. 
149). This skeletal image, Le Grand Mastodonde, appears to be an altered 
scientific illustration of the type found in such works as Diderot's encyclo- 
pedia. It is precisely the type of image which played an important role in 
Ernst's Dada collages. Perhaps the scientific illustration served as the original 
inspiration for the creature in both versions of The Beautiful Season. The 
half-skeletal, half-fleshed-out form of the horse is reminiscent of such works 
as the 1923 mural from Eluard's house, Reality Must Not Be Seen as I Am 
(cat. no. 68). It is possible that the use of Eluard's name in the 193 1 collage 
is a disguised reference to the mural. 

A strong, highly decorative series, the components of which are variously 
titled Sea Anemones (cat. no. 113), Snow Flowers and Shell Landscapes (cat. 
nos. 124, 125) of the late 1920's is in sharp contrast to the more monumental 
group of Forests of the same time. The grattage technique of paintings of this 
series results in a dense and scumbled surface accented by vivid butterfly-like 
splashes of color. The flower shapes are remarkably like ammonites (fig. 15), 
fossil mollusk-shells common in the Rhine region. Formally, the paintings 
are sufficiently varied to warrant classification into different groups. In sev- 
eral, like Snowflowers, Ernst breaks up the canvas into two or more diagonal

wedges which form a dark background for the light forms of the flowers 
which glow with color. The paint of the flower or shell forms is applied with 
a knife so that various layers of color interpenetrate without blending. Ob- 
viously, in these paintings, as in Ernst's entire oeuvre, the process of creation 
is extremely important. Ernst is correctly considered a technical innovator. 
However, it is essential to point out that Ernst always subordinates the tech- 
nical and material aspects of his work to the larger meanings of his vision. 
In a number of the paintings the motif of a moon adds a spatial dimension 
not supplied by the flat forms of the flowers and the upended ground. The 
circular motif which appeared in such earlier Dada works as The Little Tear 
Gland That Says Tic Tac (cat. no. 46) of 1920 becomes a symbol of night 
in these works and in the great Forest series. The circle, sometimes trans- 
formed into an oval, occurs as the symbol of fertility in paintings like Inside 
the Sight: The Egg (cat. no. 131) of 1929 and Sun, Drinker and Serpents (cat. 
no. 136) of 1929-30. 

Although the basic components of the Forest paintings were found in several 
of his Dada collages, these earlier works did not approach the monumentality 
and epic quality of this series. Yet it is a grandeur of image rather than size, 
for Ernst's paintings rarely exceed easel scale. It is in the theme of the 
forest that Ernst appears to have found a unique equation for what he 
described as his aim "to bring into the light of day the results of voyages 
of discovery in the unconscious," to record "what is seen . . . and experienced 
... on the frontier between the inner and outer world." 42 This recording of 
the frontier between the inner and outer world parallels the achievement of 
Caspar David Friedrich, for whom Ernst has expressed great admiration. 
Friedrich's mystical paintings of man and nature and the related works of 
Bocklin provide the context from which Ernst's own work issued. Ernst 
observed that Friedrich had stated: "Close your physical eyes in order to 
see first your painting with the spiritual eye. Next, bring into the daylight 
what you have seen in your night so that your action is exercised in turn 
on other beings from the exterior to the interior." 43 The forest pictures reveal 
to a far greater extent than any other of Ernst's works how close the degree 
of his affinity is to German Romanticism. Friedrich's Monk by the Sea (fig. 
16) suggests the metaphysical aspects of nature and the concept of man and 
his subjective experiences as controlled by the larger forces of existence, 
just as do Ernst's equally subjective interpretations of timeless nature, The 
Great Forest, and Vision Inspired by the Porte Saint-Denis at Night (cat. nos. 
120, 119), both of 1927. These two paintings reveal how fertile the theme 
proved to be for the artist. In The Great Forest, the configuration of the 
forest is constructed of a series of vertical and diagonal forms close to the 
picture plane. Three-dimensional space is inferred by the open ring of the 
sun placed behind the trees. However, this inferred three-dimensionality is 
partially contradicted by the heavy textured pigment of the trees which 
emphasizes their flatness and identity with the picture plane. In other works 
of this series, Ernst superimposed a thin ring on the forest and added a flat 
but solid circle behind it to suggest three levels of space. These spatial levels 
do not correspond to the space of reality and create a sense of dislocation 
and confusion in the viewer. Ernst had previously used a similar spatial de- 
vice in the twenties, in such work as Woman, Old Man and Flower. He 
has constructed a fantastic spatial reality, one in which the foreground, mid- 
dleground and background of our conscious world assume new and irra- 
tional relationships. 



43 




Max Ernst wrote of his mixed feelings as a child about the forest surround- 
ing his home in Briihl: ". . . delight and oppression. And what the Romantics 
called 'emotion in the face of Nature.' The wonderful joy of breathing freely 
in an open space, yet at the same time distress at being hemmed in on all 
sides by hostile trees. Inside and outside, free and captive, at one and the 
same time." 44 These are sensations he conveys in his paintings. In Vision 
Inspired by the Porte Saint-Denis at Night, for example, the sense of wonder 
at the magic of the forest is offset by the slightly chilling aspect of the for- 
bidding darkness that surrounds it. To emphasize the primordial, all-encom- 
passing nature of the forest, Ernst has entrapped vestiges of bird-like forms, 
forms that frequently appear in a more wholesome context in other forests 
of the series, and the circle of the sun or moon, within its confines. The suffo- 
cating sense of imprisonment is enhanced by the cloying color and the place- 
ment of the forest close to the spectator. Ernst's constant quest for diversity, 
rather than perfection within a limited format, is nowhere more apparent 
than in the works of the late twenties. Even a superficial glance at such 
masterpieces as One Night of Love, Shell Flowers and The Great Forest, all 
produced, unbelievably, in the same year, reveal Ernst's encyclopedic range. 

The highly intellectual nature of Ernst's work has led critics to conduct 
archaeological digs into the sources for his motifs and the symbolic meaning 
of his images. Moreover, his acceptance of the graphic tradition of German 
art has undermined a real evaluation of his use of color. However, the full 
potential of his imagery, despite its basis in line and the strength and richness 
of his iconography, is only achieved through the use of color. Like Altdorfer 
and Friedrich, Ernst has drawn upon the inherent magic of color. The color 
theories of the Russian avant-garde, discussed earlier, and the German 
Expressionists had a profound effect upon him. However, his color is not 
a merely additive component, but is an essential complement to the symbolic 
content of his form. Unlike Matisse, who employs color to structure form,

Ernst uses color to enhance form. Ernst's exceptional ability to use color set 
him, like Miro, apart from the other Surrealists. 

Ernst creates a rather informal variant of the Forest series in the group 
of Fishbone Forests, for example The Forest (cat. no. 127), 1928. Using a tech- 
nique in which he developed his images by pressing pieces of tin into wet 
paint, Ernst spun a series of delicate webs that recall the fragile tracery of 
fish scales. Forest and sun appear in a relatively rigid juxtaposition through- 
out the series: it is the lacy, open pattern of the ridges that allows the surfaces 
to breathe. For the most part, Ernst presents the forest in the Fishbone works 
in a lighthearted manner compared to the grandiose and overwhelming Forest 
series. In 1934 he articulated this humorous viewpoint: 

Who will be the death of the forest? The day will come on which a forest, 
hitherto a womanizer, resolves to frequent only teetotal places of refresh- 
ment, walk only on tarred roads, and consort only with Sunday-afternoon 
strollers. He will live on pickled newspapers. Enfeebled by virtue, he will 
forget the bad habits of his youth. He will become geometrical, dutiful, 
grammatical, judicial, pastoral, clerical, constructivistic and republican . . . 
He will become a school-master. Will it turn out fine? Of course it will! For 
we are going diplomat-hunting . . . Will the forest be praised for its good 
behavior? Not by me, anyway. 4 * 

From 1929-1932, collage again became Ernst's dominant technique. 
Within these collages, two kinds of formal organization predominate. In 
1929 he produced a new art form, the collage-novel. The first such book, 
was La Femme 100 tetes. This title is typical of Ernst's punning. La Femme 
100 tetes is La Femme cent tetes ("The Hundred-Headed Woman"). It can 
also be read as La Femme sans tetes ("The Hundred-Headless Woman"). 
This was followed by Reve d'une petite fille qui voulut entrer au carmel 
and Une Semaine de bonte. In the collage-novels, the compositional struc- 
ture is conventionally illusionistic; Ernst used nineteenth-century engravings 
as the basis for these works. He altered them by adding bizarre images but 
did not change their actual structure. The resulting Surreal images are not 
merely dream-like, they are grotesque and nightmarish. A man kissing a 
woman sprouts webbed wings, a huge snake is coiled in a city courtyard, parts 
of human anatomy are transformed into hideous beasts, birds or fish. Yet 
these weird creatures enact the conventional melodrama of Victorian novels. 

Ernst introduced the mythical half-bird, half-beast Loplop in a series 
of individual collages which date from 1929-32. Their formal organization 
is entirely different from that of the collage-novels. Their structure is 
basically Cubist, with emphasis on the flat surface of the paper. Fragments 
of photographs, rubbings, pieces of wallpaper, botanical and anatomical 
drawings are enhanced with watercolor and pencil and displayed within a 
rather rigidly organized format. Loplop himself appears to represent Ernst 
who, in the guise of the painter, presents some of his obsessions: the seductive 
female body, lush vegetation, a series of suggestive hands, with or without 
gloves, the latter reminiscent of Klinger. Loplop introduces The Marseillaise 
in 1930 and 1931, a shell flower and a young girl in 1931, and climactically, 
Loplop Introduces Members of the Surrealist Group (cat. no. 150) in 1931. 
Several large panels, variations of the Loplop theme, appear to have been 
inspired in part by the plaster-covered plywood walls used by Bunuel in his 
film L 'Age d'or in which Ernst appeared. In these works Ernst continues the 
collage tradition of applied found objects. They take a relief-like form which 



45 



finds its most important expression in the major work, Europe After the Rain 
i, 1933, (fig. 17). 

In 1934 Max Ernst spent some time with Giacometti at Maloja. Together 
they found several granite stones in a nearby riverbed which, because of their 
shape, inspired Ernst to work in the round. His incursions into the area of 
sculpture had been relatively limited until this time — he had produced a few 
found objects which do not constitute an ongoing body of work. He altered 
the stones only by the addition of color and decorative elements in the shape 
of figures, flowers or birds and in some cases by incising the stone, leaving 
the original form more or less intact. In certain other sculptures, however, 
Ernst reworked his material so that the original objects became unrecogniz- 
able and then cast them in plaster. In most sculpture of the latter category, 
for example, Oedipe I and // (cat. nos. 162, 163) 1934, found objects, like 
flowerpots, are the starting point, but the final form has human characteris- 
tics. These sculptures, originally conceived in plaster, were not cast in bronze 
until the 1950's and 1960's, for lack of funds. Certain forms in Ernst's reliefs 
were as important as the Maloja stones in inspiring his three-dimensional 
work. Ernst developed the relationship of rectangular forms in his relief 
Anthropomorphic Figure (fig. 18) in a number of his later sculptures, espe- 
cially An Anxious Friend (cat. no. 2.07), 1944. 

A singular characteristic of the work of this period is that the principle 
of collage is inherent in even the most sculptural forms. Their fully three- 
dimensional reality is, however, in no way compromised by the collage-like 
assemblage of separate parts. That Ernst was able to move easily between the 
two and three-dimensional aspects of his work is evident in his sculpture 
Moonmad (cat. no. 211), 1944, whose face appears in several incarnations in 
paintings, for example The Illustrated Maker of Dreams (cat. no. 253), 1959. 
The influence of Ernst's sculpture on his painting is even more apparent in 
a series of oils of 1947-48, among which is The Feast of the Gods (cat. no. 
222), 1948. The mask-like images in this painting are Ernst's most explicit 
references to his earlier sculpture. 

Ernst's sculpture occupies a unique place in the totality of his oeuvre, for 
it does not reflect the concerns of Surrealism. The physicality that interested 
him in his sculpture made it impossible for him to translate successfully 
the illusionistic dream-imagery or automatism of his painting. Although 
Ernst alone among the Surrealist painters was able to create sculpture, it was 
not Surrealist sculpture. Instead, it reflects Ernst's awareness of primitive 
art, as is apparent in the figures Oedipe 1 and 11, 1934, The Lovely German Girl 
(cat. no. 167), Bird Head (cat. no. 166) 1934-35 and Young Man with a Beat- 
ing Heart (cat. no. 210), 1944. Ernst exploits the primitive forms for humor 
rather than their emotional power, which sets him apart from Giacometti 
whose primitivistic work was full of drama and intensity. Ernst's forms are 
utterly simple: The Lovely German Girl, for example, is composed of the 
barest essentials: a disc, twin antennae, a few rounded projecting forms sug- 
gesting eyes, nose or mouth and shell-like chignon. Ernst reasserts the pres- 
ence of nature in the linear striations of Young Flower Shaped Woman and 
Turtle (cat. nos. 214, 212), 1944, a pattern resembling the angular veins of the 
leaf of the Seibold Plantainlily (fig. 19), common in southern France. The 
most obvious connection between Ernst and Giacometti, aside from their 
shared interest in primitive sculpture, is their use of a table-top platform as a 
base. In Ernst's work the base is a purely formal element unifying the com- 
ponents of the piece. Giacometti, however, also uses the base to introduce a

complex interplay between illusion and reality, between the real space of the 
viewer and the space occupied by the sculpture. 

Ernst has stated: "Whenever I get into an impasse with painting, which 
happens to me all the time, sculpture is always there as a way out; for sculp- 
ture is even more a game than painting." 46 His sculptures of the 1950's and 
early 1960's attest to this sense of play. A work like Are you Niniche? (cat. no. 
247), 1955-56, is deceptively simple, a composite of two ox-yokes and a block 
of type. Yet its seemingly simplicity, like that of African sculpture, enhances 
its more humorous implications and, like many of Ernst's sculptures, masks 
the more profound and timeless quality of his form. Despite the importance of 
his sculptural oeuvre, however, Ernst's primary concern has always been 
painting. 

Ernst, still a German national, was very much out of sympathy with Hitler 
who had consolidated his totalitarian power in 1933. Politically aware and 
intellectual, Ernst by 1933 obviously recognized that Germany, and Europe 
as well, were headed for disaster. His premonitions are expressed in Europe 
after the Rain I, 1933, in which he symbolized the nightmare about to befall 
the continent. It is one of the few almost totally abstract images that Ernst 
ever painted. Yet, paradoxically, despite its abstract quality, it urgently ex- 
presses the human condition. The maximum use of texture, observed in the 
plaster Loplop reliefs of 1930, literally represents the physical surface of Eu- 
rope, a Europe which Ernst lays waste to by obliterating its particular fea- 
tures. The broken contours of the continent, over which the huge smear of 
destruction is beginning to appear, quite obviously stand for political and 
social realities. The dense and earthy textures surely may be interpreted as 
symbolizing the primitive or bestial aspect of man. Many years later Dubuffet 
was to exploit this symbolic texturology as his own invention. Whether Du- 
buffet saw this painting is uncertain; the fact that it was Ernst's esthetic in- 
vention at such an early date is telling and dramatic.

film Die Widerrechtliche Ausiibung der 
Astronomie, 1966, by Schneede in Max

Ernst's concern with the coming devastation of Europe is evident also in a 
group of small works on the barbarian theme, for example Barbarians 
Marching to the West (cat. no. 172) of 1935. Small and inconclusive in resolu- 
tion, their agitated zoological forms are eclipsed by the much greater devas- 
tation represented in his monumental City series, for example The Entire 
City (cat. nos. 176, 177), 1935-36. Like the ruins of ancient civilizations, the 
citadels in these works sit in majestic but lonely splendor, framed by a few 
vestiges of vegetation. In these extraordinary paintings, lush but harsh vegeta- 
tion stands in ironic contrast to the barren ruins of civilization. Their frighten- 
ing impact increases when we realize they preceded World War II. 

Several works of 1935-36 incorporate humorous elements and offer a 
quixotic change of pace. Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe (cat. no. 175), is a take-off on 
Manet's painting, itself a play on a theme of Raphael. Ernst extends the 
parody even further, for he refers also to Picasso's forms of the early 1920's. 
He has exaggerated the sexual implications of Manet's painting, for he seems 
to represent rape rather than an idyllic encounter. Ernst presents a landscape 
and situation which promises pleasure, but imbues it with morbid overtones. 
None of the joy of the Picassos that Ernst drew upon is present here. The lust 
of the somewhat ambiguous, albeit obviously coupling figures to the right is 
observed by the rather detached half-bird, half-human mother and child. 
Here again, Ernst identifies himself as a bird, observing from a distance, 
through the intellect. 

In other paintings of this period, like The Garden Airplane-Trap series of 
1935, for example (cat. nos. 169, 170), Ernst continues to represent the devas- 
tation of The Entire City. The plant forms, like the Venus Fly Trap, have a 
carnivorous quality and they appear to be lying in wait for their victims. 
Placed on a seemingly endless deserted promontory, they are the last rem- 
nants of life, much like the ruins of The Entire City. Ernst reveals in this series 
the endless variations he can wrest from a single theme. The use of themes in

series by Ernst, which has seldom been written about, began in the late twen- 
ties with subjects like The Forest and The Horde. Prior to that, Ernst had con- 
centrated on working out ideas in individual works; even the early collages, 
as closely related to one another as they are, have a self-contained and com- 
plete character not present in the works of the thirties. 

The Angel of Hearth and Home, a theme expressed in a series of three 
paintings, is a protest against the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War and a re- 
sponse to Picasso's Guernica (fig. zo). Of this work, Ernst has stated: "The 
Angel of Hearth and Home ... is of course an ironic title for a kind of jugger- 
naut which crushes and destroys all that comes in its path. That was my im- 
pression at the time of what would probably happen in the world, and I was 
right." 47 Schneede points out that in 1938, Ernst titled the painting The Tri- 
umph of Surrealism, as "a despairing reference to the fact that the Surrealists 
with their Communist ideas had been unable to do anything to resist Fas- 
cism." 48 Of the three versions, all of which contain a demonic figure attacked 
by a fantastic, Boschian reptilian monster, perhaps the most successful is the 
smallest, The Angel of Hearth and Home (cat. no. 180), (it measures only 
about 21 x 29 inches), and least rhetorical. The forms seem monumental de- 
spite their diminuitive size. Although the central figure is smaller than in the 
other two paintings, his wing span is far more impressive. Furthermore, 
placement of the smaller figure within a vast space conveys an effect of ex- 
pansive energy greater than that discharged in the somewhat cramped space 
of the larger version. Nonetheless, in the largest painting, The Angel of Earth 
(cat. no. 181), it is the flame-like figure of the Angel, actually the devil, that by 
virtue of its posture, is the most terrifying embodiment of war. And it is 
with this painting that the most fascinating comparison may be made with 
Picasso's Guernica, as well as with two less well-known but equally potent 
statements by Miro, a poster designed to attract sympathy for the beseiged 
Spanish people, Aidez I'Espagne (fig. 21), and a painting, Still Life with Old 
Shoe (fig. 22). 

Picasso uses a journalistic style in his mural-size painting to graphically 
depict the horrors of the war. Despite his overriding concern with the specific 
situation, Picasso has converted the scene into an allegorical representation 
using the symbols that had obsessed him for some time — the bull, for ex- 
ample—which transforms the work into a monumental expression of univer- 
sal suffering. A grandiose statement such as Picasso's was alien to Miro's 
temperament. For Miro, the Spanish Civil War was best represented in a 
poster, a cheap means of communication that had the potential of mass ap- 
peal. For Miro, commonplace objects— a fork, a shoe, a loaf of bread— sym- 
bolize the oppressive reality of war. Whether or not there are any biblical 
references intended in his painting, Miro has obviously used elements of the 
life of Spanish peasantry, unlike both Picasso and Ernst. Ernst's The Angel 
of Earth is neither the heroic statement of Picasso nor the modest but effective 
image of Miro. Although the painting's scale is not large, its theatricality of 
presentation lends it a certain grandeur. It is unique in that Ernst concentrates 
all his emotion about the horrors of war in a single monstrous creature. 

Nymph Echo (cat. no. 178), 1936, and Totem and Taboo (cat. no. 192, 
1941, reveal yet another facet of Ernst's work. They recall the fantasy world 
of the Douanier Rousseau, filtered, of course, through Ernst's own sensibility. 
Rousseau's lush forests and exotic scenes were known and admired by many 
of the major artists of the early twentieth-century. Many of his qualities had a 
special appeal for the Surrealists: his child-like imagination, his belief in 



51 




dreams and phantoms, his juxtaposition of objects from disparate contexts, 
his craftmanship and, of course, the dream-like quality of his work. Both 
Macke and Apollinaire were early and enthusiastic admirers of his work: 
Macke had been active in promoting exhibitions of French painters, including 
Rousseau, in Munich, and Apollinaire had championed him in Paris. His 
stylistic influence on the Surrealists was, in part, felt indirectly through de 
Chirico, who had adopted the Douanier's mysterious light and poetic disloca- 
tion. The exhibition of The Sleeping Gypsy of 1897 in the John Quinn Collec- 
tion in Paris in 19x6, after it had disappeared for many years, had a great 
impact on the Surrealists. 49 Cocteau celebrated the painting's rediscovery, 
stressing its surreal qualities, in a poem: 

The secret imagines it is alone and sheds all disguises. The gypsy sleeps with 
eyes half open . . . How can 1 describe the motionless figure and its flowing 
movement, this flow of oblivion? It reminds me of Egypt, where eyes were 
kept open even in death, like those of the diver under the surface of the ocean 
. . . Where do such things drop from? The moon? . . . Moreover it is perhaps 
not without its point that this artist, who never neglected a detail, shows us 
no tracks in the sand, no imprint, near the sleeping feet. The gypsy has not 
come here. She is here. She is not here. She is at no human place. She is one of 
those who live in mirrors.™ 



Despite their relationship to Rousseau, a sense of dread, a sinister feeling of 
entrapment emanates from the lush vegetation of Ernst's paintings of the late 
thirties and early forties. The deeply felt menace of Ernst's jungle contrasts 
sharply with Rousseau's ingenuous interpretation. The sinister looking foli- 
age presses out towards the spectator, threatening him. The plane of the sky 
recedes, emphasizing the forward movement of the plant forms. Where 
Rousseau's images are motionless, Ernst's forms are active. The vegetation

seems eerily alive; it crawls with strange monsters and reveals half-hidden 
faces. There is a frightening confusion between plant and animal life. The 
predominance of blue, green and brown in many of these paintings conveys 
an autumal feeling at variance with that of Rousseau's hot-house foliage. The 
holes in the foliage through which the sky appears in such paintings as Totem 
and Taboo recall the gaping eye-sockets of the figures in The Horde, 1927, 
and other earlier works in which intercises between forms are filled with pass- 
ages of paint that seem to have no relationship with the image. In this way, 
Ernst gives realistic forms abstract features and creates in his work an am- 
biguity between abstraction and realism. His forms recall nature but do not 
represent it, thus his art is neither realistic nor abstract, but emblematic. 

In 1938, Max Ernst moved to Saint-Martin d'Ardeche, north of Avignon, 
where he renovated a rundown seventeenth-century farmhouse. The reliefs 
(fig. 23) that he made to decorate the house indicate his continuing fascina- 
tion with his half-man, half-beast fantasy of the twenties. Affixed to the 
exterior of his house, these fantastic creatures belong to the same private my- 
thology that informs Ernst's paintings. Although he thought that he had re- 
moved himself from the pressures of the art world, Ernst's peace at Ardeche 
was soon interrupted by an ideological dispute within the ranks of the Sur- 
realists. Breton, who had delegated to himself the role of high priest of the 
order, decided to move against Eluard, and in the process ruptured the re- 
maining bonds among the members of the group. Out of loyalty and friend- 
ship for Eluard, Ernst disassociated himself from the movement. By 1939 the 
group began to disperse. Masson, Matta, Breton and Tanguy emigrated to 
the United States because of the war; Max Ernst, after internment as an alien 
by the French and then the Germans, managed to escape to the United States 
in 1941 with the help of many friends, including Peggy Guggenheim. 

While Ernst was briefly interned by the French he met Hans Bellmer. To- 
gether they experimented with the painting technique decalcomania, which 



53 



had been invented by Oscar Domi'nguez in 1935. In decalcomania, thin paint 
is spread over the canvas with a smooth implement like a pane of glass. As in 
frottage, the irregularity of the resulting paint surface suggests images which 
the artist develops into final form. In 1940 and 1941 he used this technique 
in a large number of paintings, for example, F.urope after the Rain II (cat. no. 
191), 1940-42, Napoleon in the Wilderness (cat. no. 193), 1941, and the afore- 
mentioned Totem and Taboo. When Ernst arrived in New York in 1941, he 
continued to paint in this method. Like many of the expatriates, he suffered 
from a sense of isolation that made life difficult for the European avant-garde. 
Nonetheless, Ernst had, as early as 1932, exhibited with the Julien Levy Gal- 
lery in New York and was known to a small group familiar with Surrealism. 
In 1931, the first significant exhibition of Surrealism had been staged by 
A. Everett Austin at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut; in 
1936, Alfred Barr presented the crucial exhibition, Fantastic Art, Dada, Sur- 
realism, to which Ernst contributed a number of important works. Among the 
artists in exile who influenced the future direction of American painting, the 
Surrealists with their theory of automatism proved the most important. In 
1942 Ernst began two paintings, Young Man Intrigued by the Flight of a 
Non-Euclidean Fly (fig. 24) and The Bewildered Planet (cat. no. 195). He de- 
scribed the technique he used as follows:

It is a children's game. Attach an empty tin can to a thread a metre or two 
long, punch a small hole in the bottom, fill the can with paint, liquid enough 
to flow freely. Let the can swing from the end of the thread over a piece of 
canvas resting on a flat surface, then change the direction of the can by move- 
ments of the hands, arms, shoulder and entire body. Surprising lines thus 
drip upon the canvas. The play of association then begins? 1 



Although these paintings were exhibited in late 1942 and were said to have 
been admired by Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell, the connection 
between Ernst's method and the later drip technique of Pollock was prob- 
ably not this direct. However, there is no doubt that the Surrealists' stress 
upon automatism was an important factor in the development of Abstract 
Expressionism. The technique employed in these two works of 1942 is the 
logical extension of Ernst's interests, if we consider that, as early as 1927, he 
was employing a similar method in such works as Vision Induced by a String 
Found on My Table (cat. no. 114). The Dada and Surrealist emphasis upon 
chance remains intact in Ernst's work of this period; what has changed be- 
tween 1927 and 1942 is his imagery. 

Ernst decided to leave New York relatively soon after his arrival. Although 
he traveled cross-country during much of 1942, Ernst managed to find time 
enough to paint. In the most important painting of 1942, Surrealism and 
Painting (cat. no. 198), Ernst incorporates the linear patterns derived from his 
process of trickling paint onto a canvas with the mythological figures that 
inhabit such earlier paintings as Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe (cat. no. 175), 1935- 
36. Beneath the maternal figure of the bird and her offspring is a presentation 
of the artist's tools, one of which, a trowel, is an implement he discovered in 
New York. The Eye of Silence (cat. no. 203) of 1943-44 is an example of the 
technique of decalcomania that he continued to use after his move from 
Europe to the United States. The painting, in which there are overt references 
to Bocklin's Island of the Dead (fig. 25), conveys a feeling entirely in keeping 
with the difficult times in which it was painted. The sense of mystery and

dread relates to that of nineteenth-century Romantic painters like Bocklin 
and Friedrich (fig. 26). 

In several of the paintings executed during his exile from Europe, Ernst 
appears to be recapitulating some of his earlier esthetic positions. Day and 
Night (cat. no. 194), 1941-42, a painting begun in Saint-Martin d'Ardeche 
and completed in New York, Painting for Young People (cat. no. 202) and 
especially Vox Angelica (cat. no. 201), both of 1943, offer quotations of ele- 
ments of earlier paintings and images previously used. In the most important 
of these, the Vox Angelica, Ernst incorporates both technical devices like frot- 
tage and motifs of natural phenomena important in his earlier work. In a 
device that has been used recently by color painters like Ellsworth Kelly to 
emphasize the separation of panels of color, Ernst isolated motifs by framing 
them individually. Together, the panels form a poignant autobiography or 
narrative of his considerable achievements. As a witty finale, Ernst inscribed 
his first name, M A X, in the form of a compass and triangle. He thus refers 
both to the natural and mechanical elements in his art. Vox Angelica is rather 
lighthearted, and was complemented by such whimsical works as Painting 
for Young People and Le Dejeuner sur I'berbre (cat. no. 205), 1944, and lyrical 
sculpture like The King Playing with the Queen (cat. no. 208), 1944. But he 
did not turn entirely away from his horrific visions of the later twenties and 
thirties; he details an apocalyptic scene in Rhenish Night (cat. no. 204), 1944, 
and there are ominous overtones in The Cocktail Drinker (cat. no. 216), 1945, 
and in The Feast of the Gods (cat. no. 222), 1948. 

In 1946 Ernst moved to Sedona, Arizona, with the painter Dorothea 
Tanning, to a real landscape that he saw as a parallel to the landscape of his 
mind; he remained there until 1953 when he returned to Paris. Aside from a 
number of lyrical landscapes, it is the sculpture, both free-standing and 
architectural, that is especially impressive among the works that he produced 
here. Ernst decorated his house in Sedona with a group of reliefs (fig. 27), 
but the monumental form of the throne-like Capricorn (cat. no. 223), a cement 
sculpture produced in 1948 and cast in bronze in 1964, is his most significant 
achievement of this period. Lucy Lippard has analyzed this work in the 
following terms: 

The male figure is not only the "king" of the chess game but also the symbolic 
bull and goat of the zodiac. Metamorphosis and rebirth are associated with 

Capricorn, as are fertility, Bacchus and Rock (including cement) 

Consciously or subsconsciously, Ernst used the astrological fish motif in the 
fishtailed "dog" on the king's arm and in the mermaid form of the queen, 
whose "bone" head ornament is equally a fish? 2 

What is even more significant than this specific symbolism, however, is 
the totemic aspect of the figures and the fact that Ernst combines the personal 
and monumental implications of his private mythology with the allusion to 
the timeless forms of other, ancient cultures. This is especially apparent in 
the figure, though not the head, of the queen, which assumes the formal aspect 
of a Cycladic figurine. 

If Capricorn affirms the rewarding aspect of his stay in the United States, 
then Spring in Paris (cat. no. 235), of 1950, reflects his delight in his return to 
Paris. He settled in Paris in 1953, and became a French citizen in 1958. The 
painting is also characteristic of Ernst's renewed emphasis on the single image, 
usually figurative, rather than on the more complex imagery of epic works 
like Surrealism and Painting. In The Portugese Nun (cat. no. 236), 1950, and 



57

Spring in Paris, Ernst reverts back to the traditional use of the brush and a 
rather more conventional technique of painting than he practiced during his 
stay in the United States. Although the images superficially resemble certain 
works of the mid-thirties, these paintings are considerably different formally 
from the earlier examples. The paintings of the thirties are similar in some 
respects to Tanguy's work, especially in the way in which the form is de- 
picted, although not in the manner of its integration within the composition. 
The forms of paintings of the fifties no longer are the forms of Surrealism. 
The influence of Paris and the decorative qualities of French painting are 
strongly felt in Ernst's work after his return to Europe. 

Paintings like Father Rhine (cat. no. 243), 1953, and The Polish Rider (cat. 
no. 244), 1954, which differ significantly from each other in subject, reveal 
the stylistic transformation in his painting. Although Ernst had decided 
against taking up residence in Germany, he had returned there before decid- 
ing to settle in Paris. In 1951, his home town, Briihl, arranged for his first big 
post-war retrospective, organized with the assistance of his sister Loni and her 
husband, the art historian Lothar Pretzell. Father Rhine is a sentimental 
reminiscence of his youth in Germany and a deeply felt response to the river 
and to Cologne as an important center in the history of art before the two 
world wars. The Polish Rider was inspired by the painting of the same name 
by Rembrandt which Ernst had seen at the Frick. Ernst appears less con- 
cerned with the reality of the image or with its latent symbolism than with 
the purely painterly effects of his surface and technique. In The Polish Rider 
Ernst also elaborates on the cubistic faceting of planes with which he had 
experimented before World War I, in such works as Landscape with Tower 
(cat. no. 13) of 19 16, as well as upon the purely decorative effects of his most 
minute works, the microbe series, (cat. nos. 227-230) done in Arizona from 
1949-52. 

Many paintings of the 1960's retain the improvisational quality of The 
Polish Rider. In a painting like The Sky Marries the Earth (cat. no. 262) of 
1964, Ernst has employed all the virtuosity at his command. The dense 
application of pigment, the creamy surface of the dragged areas of paint, 
the delicate tracery of his linear arabesques, represent Ernst at his decorative 
best. While neither capturing the vital organic nature of Pollock's drip paint- 
ing nor the heroic posturing of the New York School of Action Painting, 
Ernst did not succumb to the worst aspects of School of Paris painting — a ten- 
dency to allow surface to carry as form — a characteristic of French Tachiste 
painting of the post-war period. Instead, Ernst retains his own innate prefer- 
ence for investing the surface of his painting, whether the subject is abstract 
or representational, with an object-like quality. It is this tendency which, 
stemming from his Dada experience, characterizes even so soft and lush a 
painting as The Sky Marries the Earth. 

The Sky Marries the Earth is an image of the sixties just as The Polish Rider 
represents the previous decade. In the latter painting, Ernst still allows the 
fragmented form of the horse— the rider seems to have disappeared— to co- 
exist with passages of paint that recall, but do not represent, the dense foliage 
of his primordial landscapes of the 1940's. In The Sky Marries the Earth, on 
the other hand, the configuration of sky and earth are intertwined with an 
all-over imagery and painterly surface that recalls the 100,000 Doves (cat. 
no. 91) of 1925. If Vox Angelica or Painting for Young People of 1943, con- 
stitute a didactic reprisal of earlier paintings, The Polish Rider reveals Ernst's 
ability to paraphrase his own esthetic concerns tongue-in-cheek. This subter- 



59 



fuge is nowhere more apparent than in The Polish Rider, which, in addition 
to its existence as an homage to Rembrandt, is also a reference, in the use 
of faceted planes to convey motion, to Futurism. Ernst is also interested in 
conveying a sense of motion in a subdued manner in many works of the 
1960's. In The Sky Marries the Earth, for example, the round configuration of 
the sun appears to be spun like a top by the linear web that both surrounds 
and interacts with it. The lush, off-white pigment contributes to a density of 
surface that belies the implicit motion suggested by the symbolic form of the 
sun. Ernst's representation of matter (earth) and atmosphere (sky), which 
has preoccupied him since his first mature works, is achieved subtly and sug- 
gestively. That a profound involvement with nature, in both its rational and 
irrational aspects has always haunted Ernst, is evident from even the most 
casual involvement with his work. It is interesting that he was able to recast 
his feeling for nature experienced in Arizona in a near abstract mode once he 
returned to Europe. Obviously, in order to achieve this, it was necessary for 
him to distance himself from the experience. 

Ernst's enormous diversity is still apparent in his work of the 1960's. The 
pair of paintings, Swarm of Bees in a Courthouse and Explosion in the 
Cathedral (cat. nos. 256, 255), both of i960, effectively demonstrate the end- 
less variety of Ernst's interests. The reference to bees, an imperial emblem, 
and the allusion to the breakdown in both court and church, is suggested by 
titles which underline Ernst's ongoing concern with the destruction of the 
hierarchial order that was a part of his youth. The dense pigmentation of his 
earlier landscape fantasies appears in both paintings of i960. On a different 
level, Portrait of an Ancestor (cat. no. 273), 1965, appears to be a humorous 
comment on portraiture, and thus on artistic tradition. Both Portrait of an 
Ancestor and Peace, War and the Rose (cat. no. 274), 1965, are reminiscent of 
earlier works such as Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale of 1923- 
24. Just as in the earlier piece, Ernst has added collage elements to a flat panel 
in both of the more recent constructions. These placid, strictly rectilinear re- 
liefs, however, are more static and frontal than the volatile earlier construc- 
tion, to which the suggestion of flight— and fear— lends a sense of motion. In 
the humorous reference to romance, Portrait of an Ancestor is reminiscent of 
the earlier sculpture, Young Man with a Beating Heart (cat. no. 210) of 1944. 
In both, the area that represents the heart is appropriately detailed, in the 
sculpture by a concave hollow, in the construction by a rectangular wooden 
frame that encloses collage-elements. Portrait of an Ancestor, in fact, in many 
ways resembles the flattened forms of his sculpture especially An Anxious 
Friend (cat. no. 207), 1944. 

In other works of the 1960's, like Air Washed in Water (cat. no. 280) of 
1969, Ernst once again approaches total abstraction. The painting, one of 
the few statements in which he uses a strictly limited color scheme, is reminis- 
cent of objects such as the piece of metal screen placed over the bird in 
Peace, War and the Rose or the imitation lace collar in Portrait of an An- 
cestor. The atmospheric effect in the upper portion of the canvas contrasts 
effectively with the dense area of color below. 

Ernst's virtuosity continues undiminished into the seventies. He has pro- 
duced, among other works, a new series of collages, illustrated Lewis Car- 
roll's Wunderhorn, 1970, and continued to paint. Among his most recent 
paintings is the enchanting small oil, My Friend Pierrot (cat. no. 282), of 1974, 
in which he once again returns to the bird-self-portrait obsession which, in 
this example, is enhanced with the added whimsy of the clown. This paint-

ing, in which the sunny pastel colors dominate the figuration, is strikingly 
reminiscent of earlier paintings like Battle of Fish (cat. no. 18), of 1917, and 
is a fitting testament to his continuing vitality. 

Ernst's awareness of the currents that fed his art is nowhere better ex- 
pressed than in his statement about the Cologne of his youth: "The geo- 
graphical, political and climatic conditions of Cologne as a city may be 
propitious to create fertile conflicts in a sensitive child's brain . . . early Medi- 
terranean influence, Western rationalism, Eastern inclination to occultism, 
northern mythology, Prussian categorical imperative, ideals of the French 
Revolution, and so on." 53 While these concerns occasionally lend his work a 
certain archaism, this archaism is more than offset by his formal innovations. 
In this respect, many of his admirers have misinterpreted his contribution to 
the art of the twentieth century. To some, the substance of his inventiveness 
lies in his astonishing technical inventions. They see in his use of photocollage 
and frottage, in particular, a working method that constitutes his creativity. 
The opposite, in fact, is true. Ernst's ability to manipulate his materials, his 
awareness of the potential resources of found objects, new textures, and 
new working procedures, is but the prelude to the transformation of ma- 
terials into a new body of imagery. Other critics have ignored Ernst's real 
esthetic meaning in favor of a detailed analysis of his symbolism. Neither 
position, of course, takes into account Ernst's ability to record "what is seen 
. . . and experienced ... on the frontier between the inner and outer world." 
For Ernst has reached a unique position in the art of the twentieth century 
through the creation of a private mythology by means of formal innovation. 

Finally, it must be said that if Max Ernst has come to epitomize both Dada 
and Surrealism, it is because he has adhered not to the letter but to the spirit 
of these movements. That he has done so is a tribute to his understanding of 
the profound possibilities open to art in the twentieth century and his un- 
daunting optimism in the face of so many esthetic, social and political 
tribulations.
