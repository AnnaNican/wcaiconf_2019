Preface and Acknowledgements 



The mature work of Jack Tworkov clearly divides into two components that 
at first glance appear remote from, if not incompatible with, each other: his 
"hot" gestural painting of the 1950s and early 1960s and his "cool" measured 
work of subsequent years, to use the designations supplied by Andrew Forge 
in the essay that follows in this catalogue. Since this exhibition is not con- 
ceived as a full retrospective but as a survey of Tworkov's painting from the 
last fifteen years, only his later phase is presented here. The selection was so 
restricted in full agreement with the artist in order to stress the autonomy of 
the direction he has pursued since 1966. Obviously, an emphasis of this kind 
is not gained without a concomitant loss — in this instance, the loss of that 
other Tworkov whose spontaneous Abstract Expressionist canvases of the 
earlier years assured him a place of honor among the first generation of art- 
ists who created the new American painting in the wake of World War II. 

In an exhibition concerned with Tworkov's lifework, the absence of the pro- 
duction of the fifties and the first half of the sixties would be unthinkable, for 
as Andrew Forge's essay makes plain, the two Tworkovs, ultimately compre- 
hensible as one, stand to each other in a dialectic relationship that is close to 
the central meaning of his art. Our purpose, however, is to isolate Tworkov's 
classic strain and to bring before the viewer works indicative of the range 
and the fullness of this geometric mode. 

I wish to thank Linda Shearer, who, as Guest Curator of this exhibition, worked 
closely with the artist in selecting the paintings on display. Her sensitivity and 
acumen are reflected in the choices made. The exhibition and the accom- 
panying catalogue are supported by the National Endowment for the Arts — 
the Federal Agency that has enabled the Guggenheim Museum and other 
cultural institutions throughout the United States to maintain significant 
levels of production.

The successful realization of this exhibition and catalogue were made pos- 
sible through the commitment of many individuals. I am, above all, indebted 
to Jack Tworkov, who has enthusiastically participated in every aspect of the 
undertaking. I am grateful, too, for the unfailing support of Wally Tworkov, 
the artist's wife. Thanks are due to Nancy Hoffman, the artist's dealer, and her 
staff, whose assistance with both exhibition and publication has been invalu- 
able. Andrew Forge, long the artist'sfriend and admirer, has enriched the 
catalogue with his cogent essay. I gratefully acknowledge the efforts and ded- 
ication of numerous members of the Guggenheim Museum staff. In particular, 
my sincerest thanks areextended to Susan B. Hirschfeld, Exhibitions Coordi- 
nator, for her indispensable contributions to all phases of the exhibition as 
well as the catalogue. I am also grateful to Carol Fuerstein, Editor, for her 
skillful editing of the publication and handling of its production, and to Cyn- 
thia Clark, Editorial Assistant, for her careful help with the catalogue. Finally, 
I would like to thank the lenders, without whom this exhibition could not have 
taken place.

The Knight and the Barrier 



by Andrew Forge 



Jack Tworkov has never learned to take his work for granted, nor, one might 
add, his very existence. The habit of asking questions is ingrained. For the 
last fifteen years or so his painting has been based on more or less predeter- 
mined systems of construction, a direction he took in reaction to the cul-de- 
sac that faced him and many of his Abstract Expressionist colleagues. But "I 
have misgivings, worries about my present work," he wrote only a year ago. 
"It's true, system does not exclude spontaneity and fresh invention, but it 
does include an element of the mechanical, the predictable. My earlier work, 
although it tended to resolve itself into a predictable style . . . nevertheless . . . 
was preceded at least at the start, by a void, by the absence of any ascertain- 
able direction. In contrast, the present paintings begin with exact drawings, 
almost equivalent to an architect's drawing, and the painting follows the exact 
surface divisions, proportions and the arrived shapes and forms. Only the 
actual painting, the work with the brush, and the development of the color and 
surface is left to the spontaneous decision of the moment." 

How to recover a broader spontaneity, he asks himself in this irritable 
self-critique, written in a sketchbook on his knee in a train. None of his at- 
tempts, his tentative studies, have satisfied him. On the contrary, they have 
seemed less "inspired" than the paintings based on systems. 

So the round goes on. Few artists of his stature have felt so acutely the 
contradictions implicit in being a painter caught between the inner necessi- 
ties of the studio and the dubious external relationships given in our be- 
nighted time. He has an intense longing for content and for meaningful links 
between what he is doing in the studio and the world outside. This longing is 
expressed repeatedly in conversation, in writing, in histeaching. He is look- 
ing for something more than the recognition of a gallery-going public, and at 
the back of all his questioning of his own studio procedures one senses a 
larger questioning, addressed to the culture, to the institutions of art, to the 
sense of self and of community. And out of that larger question there comes 
an acknowledgement of frailty and of dependence on painting as a continual 
remaking of the self. "I am not ashamed to confess that I've seen my work . . . 
not merely as 'a way of life' but as a way to save my life." 

It has been a long working life. Born with the century, Tworkov first 
showed in the late twenties. He was an easel painter on the Project. After the 
war he saw, was part of, the massing and breaking of that great wave of ener- 
gies that produced the School of New York, now dispersed. By temperament 
he is a man of balance and of conscience — but one for whom the activity of 
painting is a personal necessity, unreasonable and amoral though it is. 

He has never learned to resolve this contradiction nor to ignore the pain 
of it. An inveterate journal-keeper, his writing is like an extended critique of 



10 



himself and his times in which the most awkward questions are nagged at 
compulsively over the years. But the habit of asking questions is itself only 
another reminder of the dichotomies between art and life: "I find I can only 
work without asking myself questions, without ideas. If I start thinking about 
meaning — I can only ask questions . . . but I cannot come up with answers that 
will materially change my work or push it into well-supported directions. . . ." 

Far too fastidious ever to fall into bohemian cliches of creativity, still he 
has to work with a sense of contradiction between the wordless involvements 
of the studio and the dialect of "real life." It is not an easy position to hold. Yet 
he demands a justification for it, something beyond the inflated value the 
West has put on art. The culte de moi is not enough. "Art can pollute our life 
as much as technology can pollute our air and water." Modern art, he tells 
himself in a note of quiet fury, is radical, nihilistic and pessimistic for "it sees 
no hope in societal values — individual life is without relation to common 
values — is for itself by itself. This is misery — but where is the way out?" 

It is his fate to contradict, to be more convinced by contradiction itself 
than by its poles: "I have to believe in an art that does not strive for any overt 
significance or meaning; an art that does not set out to reflect the world or 
life...."; but at other times the pain is not to be dispersed with stoicism and 
his sense of alienation from the present and exile from a richer imagined past 
is as vivid as it has ever been: "I nevertheless feel some inner deprivation, 
some sorrowful regret that my art is not more explicitly some expression of 
existence outside and beyond myself. . . ." 

Writing a few years ago about his use of geometry, I remarked, "Obvi- 
ously Tworkov is not using it symbolically as it was used in the Christian- 
Neoplatonic tradition. Nor is he using it as an aesthetic gloss, a guide to pic- 
torial decorum, as it was its fate to be used in the academies. . . . His love for it 
is evident, yet he makes no special claim for it either as an aesthetic canon 
nor as the vehicle for ideas outside painting." And I concluded, "It is utterly 
neutral, and one supposes that it is precisely this neutrality, this self-evident 
consistency that is valuable to him. He puts us all on the same level in front of 
these canvases, as if we were all cousins to that slave of Socrates who . . . was 
called in to prove the self-evident truth of a geometrical theorem." 

I now feel this was too abrupt. For one thing, no describable feature of 
any painting of quality is without symbolic value. There is more to be said 
about the values that accrue to Tworkov's use of geometry, perhaps best by 
comparing one of his earlier, gestural paintings, and one of his geometrical 
ones of about twelve years later. The main difference between them can be 
expressed in terms of a dramatic contrast of distance. It is worth trying to de- 
scribe the features that contribute to this feeling. 

Barrier Series No. 5 of 1 963 (fig. 1 ), a canvas of about five feet by six and 
a half, is divided vertically into four roughly drawn sections. They lean some- 
what to the right. One senses that the section at the far right is leaning slightly 
out of the picture and that the section at the far left is leaning into it from the 
outside: there is less of it to be seen than of the others. The painting as a 
whole has the aspect of a piece or detail of something much larger than itself, 
a world of long, leaning columns made of flame-like brushstrokes vigorously 
licking up and down. The colors with which these columns are brushed move 
from the left from a cold brownish gray through which one can see glints of 
blue, to a rich warm brown (the second column) to a powerful orange-red, not 
far from scarlet, the color of the two columns on the right. Crossing over these

columns, silhouetted in front of them, are three thick bluish black lines that 
form a fragment of a grid, somewhat bent to the right. A fourth line is buried in 
the interior of the painting. It runs slanting across the canvas and is visible in 
the gaps between the long color strokes which envelop it. These strokes — the 
fiery orange and the brown — make a vigorous advance: they threaten to en- 
gulf the dark lines on the surface, licking over them here and there, breaking 
into their edges. 

It is almost impossible to describe the painting without engaging in ani- 
mistic fantasies: it seems natural to describe the color as hot, fiery, smoulder- 
ing; the brushstrokes as flaming. From this it is a short step to seeing the 
leaning and bending of the edges of forms as a reaction to the "heat" of the 
color, a twisting and buckling as of timbers or girders in intense heat. 

There is of course another line to be followed out — although it is writing 
that insists on this sequential extension, not the painting. This is the interpre- 
tation of the painting as the result of studio activity; to read the brushstrokes 
as gestures, to enter into the athletic, improvisatory history of their making. 
From this point of view we are drawn into an awesome display of energy. We 
can sense the shaping of the whole picture by the action of arm and hand. 
The way that almost every feature leans over to the right is like a right-handed 
hatching on an enormous scale, a natural orientation of gesture which has 
become an ordering of the whole surface. 

All these features seen in simultaneous conjunction serve to bring the 
picture into very close range. A hot, blazing fragment made visible to us by a 
palpably physical action, we cannot gain distance from it on any terms. The 
relation between action and the resulting form is one to one. To engage with 
the picture at all is to be very close to it indeed. 

A painting called Knight Series OC#3 of 1975 (fig. 2) contrasts with 
Barrier in almost every nameable aspect. Seven and a half feet tall, just over 
six feet wide, it is divided into a regular grid of one hundred and twenty 
squares. The square of the shorter side of the canvas, that is the lower ten 



12 



ranks of ten squares, provides the field for a smaller square, eight by eight, 
the divisions of a chessboard. Within this there is contained a more complex 
geometrical figure. In describing these features to one's self, it seems natural 
to move from the whole canvas to the way it is divided, from the regular grid 
of squares to the larger square, the "chessboard." Each stage of the descrip- 
tion is complete in itself: it does not overlap with another stage. 

The construction lines are plainly visible, a delicate but firm framework 
for whatever else is to be seen in the painting. The divisions are linear but in 
most cases reinforced by changes in color. The outer margin of the painting 
is the most densely brushed, a cool pewter gray. The field of the chessboard 
is a paler blue-gray. The geometrical figure within the chessboard is divided 
into different areas of white (the surface of the canvas), pale yellow and a 
warmergray which in certain areas crosses the yellow. All these colors are 
applied with a small, uniformly repeated up-and-down stroke worked out in 
neat rows, four deep to the square. This repeated stroke, which resembles 
nothing so much as the kind of copybook exercise that used to be given to 
children when they were being taught to write, is small enough to provide a 
completely unified surface, open enough to be transparent and vigorous 
enough to set up a faint background vibration. Where one layer of color is 
brushed over another, as in the outer margin of the picture, the surface is

A diagonal grid is formed by dividing 
the square into three, five and eight 
segments (left) and connecting all 
peripheral points to one another 
(right). Each resulting line is the 
diagonal of a rectangle.

denser but takes on a more complex tonality, a kind of luster. None of these 
changes interferes with the grid structures for which the color serves as an 
infilling, like a dense script fill ing the pages of a book. 

The figure within the chessboard is different from anything else in the 
picture. The title directs our attention to the Knight's move in chess, and in 
fact it is this move of two squares along and one to the side which determines 
the drawing of the whole figure. Each move is marked by a dot, starting from 
the Knight's proper square on the top rank of the board, moving across to 
KR4, then on KB1 on the opposite side, zigzagging back, crossing his tracks 
but never resting on a square he had rested on before. His journey stops when 
he arrives at Q1 on his own side. What this imaginary knight has done is to 
"draw" a variety of overlapping squares, triangles and polygons. His resting 
places are marked and joined with a ruled line. Four shapes are chosen to be 
colored — a tilted square which is to be yellow, and two smaller rectangles 
and a more complicated figure with seven sides which takes the darker gray. 
The rest is left white. 

The figure facing us thus offers a choice of two distinct readings: we can 
see it as a group of overlapping planes placed simultaneously in front of us, or 
we can see it as a linear path, to be followed sequentially (in either direction) 
from start to finish. To do this is to engage in the making of the figure, to follow 
each move as a decision and, in the end, to ponder decisions about which 
area is to be colored and when to end the game. Neither reading is definitive, 
obviously, nor do they merge with each other. They are discrete, cannot be 
"seen" at the same time, although the knowledge or memory of the alternative 
will be present in our minds as we engage in one or the other reading. 

It is clear from this comparison that the two paintings bring out contrast- 
ing modes of thought and feeling, contrasting states of awareness. It is not 



14 



just that the paintings look different; they stand for different mental opera- 
tions and different ways of apprehending the world. 

Barrier leads to sensations of closeness, an almost overwhelming sense 
of melting, of being drawn into a fiery opening, into something much larger, 
something boundless and terrible. Knight, cool and pale in tonality, is dis- 
tanced, contained, bounded. Its margins are calmly stated and seem to affirm 
the boundaries between ourselves and the picture, and indeed the gap across 
which we read it. 

Our reading of Barrier happens explosively and chaotically. The picture 
seems to pour in upon us at once. One reading of it fuses with another. The 
picture takes on many identities which glide back and forth like identities in a 
dream which are nonetheless vivid for being ambivalent. It is as though mo- 
ments of time were opened up to simultaneous experience. Our reading of 
Knight, on the other hand, happens sequentially; we move from feature to fea- 
ture, from whole to part, from division to subdivision. It is a cumulative read- 
ing in which each stage seems to be experienced, told over, in an orderly 
progression. This quality is epitomized in the final engagement with the 
knight's move which is only completely understood when it has been run to its 
conclusion as a sequence in time. 

What is to be made of the comparisons I have drawn here? The two 
phases of Tworkov's painting seem to cover an immense span of human ex- 
perience. The meaning of any painter's work is cumulative. I find it impossible 
to disassociate Tworkov's geometric painting from what has gone before. 
Both phases complement each other in spite of their apparently irreconcil- 
able tenors. Each achieves its fullness of meaning in the other's light, and one 
suspects that the argument has in fact never been broken off. 

Was the change to geometries the result of a blinding conversion? Surely 
not. We need to be able to see the two phases of his work as opposing factors 
in his own continuing questions, even if one of them has, for a season or a 
decade, been argued into silence. Of course the times had their impact. His 
move from "hot" gestural painting to "cool" measured painting paralleled the 
moves that were being made by younger painters in the early sixties, a re- 
action to the cliches of Abstract Expressionism. It was part of a general revul- 
sion against the condition of a whole school that was trapped sentimentally in 
its own myth about itself. This was perhaps his surface reason, his message 
and critique aimed at his generation. 

But there were compelling private reasons. "I was eager to experiment," 
he told Marcia Tucker in an interview, "I wasn't content to form a style and 
stay with it. Then I found that in order to experiment, / had to have some con- 
stant that I could fasten on to, at least some elements, certain divisions of the 
canvas, for instance, that I could measure and repeat. Therefore I could take 
the same kind of structure and paint it differently." (My italics) 

The improvisation of the earlier mode, starting with a void, ends in a pre- 
dictable "style" in which the freedom to experiment is lacking. Warmth, prox- 
imity, an overwhelming and absorbing presence could, with luck on his side, 
be won from the engagement with paint and the vast physical demands of the 
canvas. A show of aggression, a masterful and omnipotent command, could 
with luck on his side, bring about a strong concrete symbol, a form that looked 
back at him, that returned his energy and angry drive, a chunk of the world 
bitten off, annexed to himself. The mood was insistently repetitive; the canvas 
a mirror in which only one likeness was returned. But in order to experiment, 



15 



that is, to essay, to attempt, to investigate, to rifle the unknown, to experience 
freshness and novelty — that is, to pass into a more evolved relationship with 
the world — he had to find "a constant" that he could "fasten on to" and it had 
to be something that he could "measure and repeat." What an extraordinary 
paradox! 

The point is that this constant was out there. Geometry provided a struc- 
ture whose existence could be acknowledged outside of himself. It was there 
whenever he wanted it. It could be lost, but found again. It made no demands 
— yet its laws were as inexorable as they were self-evident. He could only use 
it in an attitude of respect for it: a line is either straight or not; two lines either 
meet or do not. 

In a moving note Tworkov has written, "The hope that art reveals the 
whole man is frustrated — at best we show bits and pieces of ourselves often 
ambiguous as if they didn't belong to the same person. And indeed we make 
our appearances under different masks, masks sometimes imposed on us by 
our modesty — more often by hypocrisy. Art becomes a formal game, a civi- 
lized dance — unfortunately." We catch here something utterly characteristic 
of him, a kind of debonair despair, a hint of bitter pain behind the worldly de- 
meanor. His despair is pointed atthe world, atthe horrorof things as they 
really are. He cannot comfort himself, least of all by the fictional comforts of 
art. Corrupt contemporary usages of art turn him off. At the same time, he is 
tied to art and cannot relinquish its magic. 

To return one more time to the comparison of Barrier and Knight. I find it 
obvious that the earlier work calls up a more primitive awareness, a magical 
domain that only art allows us to enter at will in which boundaries are fused 
and everything is subject to manipulation. Time, space, distinctions between 
here and there have all run together in a single flow of energy. Knight de- 
clares an opposite extreme. In its world, things stand at a distance, and in 
their freestandingness do not answer to the same kind of omnipotent manipu- 
lation. We could say that it tokens a view of reality that acknowledges the 
existence of the outside world, the reality of time and space, and, with the 
dropping of omnipotence, of death. His energy can ebb and flow. He can turn 
his back on the painting: it will still be there when he returns. "Art is the 
metropolis of symbolic manifestation," Adrian Stokes has written. "We prac- 
tice therein the rites of symbolism. Consequently, we may practice there . . . 
every mode of perception." In contemplating side by side these two phases of 
Tworkov's painting, it seems to me that we are drawn into two universal 
modes of perception, the storming unities of infancy, its rages and enveloping 
comforts — and the anxious responsibility of later experience with its mature 
recognition of a freestanding reality with its acceptance of potential loss. 

I have called one phase of Tworkov's painting hot and the other cool and 
have stressed the contrast between them. It is a feature of the very greatest 
art that it sets the stage for traffic between these two extremes. Tworkov's 
reiteration of the limits and even poverty of today's art perhaps reflects an 
intuition that such traffic isfor us scarcely possible. Modern art has insisted 
on purity, on unity of purpose, on reduction even at the risk of poverty. By his 
own testimony he has not found the elbow room he needed for his generous 
dialectic. But I would insist that there is compelling meaning in the single 
notes that he has been forced to sing. I have no difficulty in reading his works 
as parables, rich in reference to our uneasy place in the world.
