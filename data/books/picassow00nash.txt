Preface 



It is with special pride that we at the Fine Arts 
Museums of San Francisco present the exhibition 
Picasso and the War Years: 1937-1945, documented 
by the publication of this book. Both are historical 
events of the first order. They represent the fulfill- 
ment of a longtime dream of Steven Nash's, exhibi- 
tion organizer and Associate Director and Chief 
Curator at the Fine Arts Museums, to assemble for 
the first time in this country an exhibition on this 
fascinating and under-studied period of Picasso's 
work when art and history dramatically conjoined. 

From our internal perspective, the exhibition 
advances further our museums' mission to embrace 
more fully in our collection and programs the 
most creative and intellectually challenging art of 
the twentieth century. From the point of view of 
scholarship and historical information, we expect 
the exhibition and book to make a significant and 
lasting contribution. 

Although many exhibitions and publications 
have examined different aspects of Picasso's prodi- 
gious career, ours is the first in the United States 
to focus specifically on the period between the 
Spanish Civil War and the end of World War II, 
when Picasso's art intensely reflected the global 
holocaust and the strain of life under the German 
Occupation of France. A similar exhibition took 
place approximately ten years ago at the Ludwig 
Museum in Cologne, but ours benefits from the 
extensive new research on this period of Picasso's 
life and work that is made possible largely by the 



systematic organization in recent years of the 
Picasso Archives at the Musee Picasso, Paris, and 
its vast holdings of correspondence, photographs, 
press clippings, and other pertinent documents. 
Our organizational team is greatly indebted to 
the staff at the Musee Picasso for all the help they 
provided in making these holdings accessible. 

Despite the fact that it contains some of his most 
personally expressive and, ultimately, character- 
isitic work, Picasso's war period has not received 
attention from scholars and collectors commensu- 
rate with its importance. Understandably, this owes 
in part to the art's dark, grim, and challenging 
qualities that have not been popularly accepted as 
have other more colorful or pleasurable emotional 
aspects of his stylistic development. Also important 
is Picasso's having personally retained a significant 
proportion of the work from this period, and its 
passing after his death directly into the private col- 
lections of his heirs, keeping sizable portions from 
general public awareness. Guernica, one ol the 
landmark achievements of this period, is, of course, 
well known to anyone interested in Picasso and 
modern art, and certain other key works from this 
era - e.g.. The Charnel House, variations of the 
Weeping Woman, L'Aubadc, Night Fishing at 
Antibes, and Man with a Lamb have also attained 
the status of icons. But main other strong and 
evocative works from the time remain little know n 
and underappreciated. It is often in these less 
acclaimed paintings, drawings, sculptures, and 



prints that we find the most telling messages of 
Picasso's inner reaction to cataclysmic world events 
and their effects on his personal world. These are 
messages of timely relevance, given a general 
renewed interest in the history of World War II 
and Nazi cultural policies, augmented by the efforts 
of contemporary artists to address political and 
social realities. 

Through the works in this exhibition and book 
we see a remarkable record of the interaction of art 
with historical events. No other artist of the twenti- 
eth century left so sustained a visual account of the 
devastating effect of war on life and the human 
spirit. For a comparable achievement, one must 
look back to the work of Picasso's revered country- 
man Francisco de Goya, whose accounts of atroci- 
ties in the Napoleonic wars in Spain almost 150 
years earlier have much in common with Picasso's 
modern updates of the language of loss, struggle, 
sorrow, and commemoration. We hope through 
our project to promote greater public understand- 
ing and appreciation of what Picasso achieved. 

In the accompanying acknowledgments Steven 
Nash has thanked the many individuals who 
helped in one way or another with the enormous 
logistical and research effort that lies behind this 
project. I add my own voice of thanks to his and 
also single out for special commendation the out- 
standing organizational work that Steven Nash 
himself has done. We are particularly grateful to 
our colleagues at the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum, New York, especially Robert Rosenblum, 
Thomas Krens, and Lisa Dennison, for their help 
and support, to the many lenders to the exhibi- 
tion, and to those sponsors who helped make it 
all possible. Thank you.

Acknowledgments 



It is axiomatic to note that the organization of a 
major international exhibition in today's art world 
requires the assistance of a great many individuals 
both inside and external to the home institution. 
For an exhibition on Pablo Picasso, the debts of 
gratitude for assistance are particularly deep, given 
the many challenges that any organization is bound 
to encounter. High insurance values, the frequency 
of loan requests for well-known works, and the 
inevitable, central importance of such works in 
their respective collections help make the securing 
of necessary loans a particularly daunting task. 
A great many works by Picasso from the period 
surveyed in the present exhibition, i.e., 1937-1945, 
remain sequestered in private collections, their 
locations unrevealed to recent scholarship and 
cataloguing efforts. Documentation for this period 
in general is relatively scarce and often difficult to 
access, due in part to the disruptions caused by 
World War II and also to the fact that important 
materials still reside in private hands or in diliicult- 
to-penetrate government collections. 

With these obstacles in mind, it is especially 
gratifying to be able to acknowledge and thank the 
many colleagues, collectors, friends, and other 
individuals connected in one way or another with 
our enterprise who have all contributed so much to 
the success of Picasso and the War Years: 1937-1945. 
Chief among these are Dr. Robert Rosenblum, 
Professor of Fine Arts at New York Universitv and 
my co-organizer at the Guggenheim Museum, 



whose deep knowledge of Picasso, generositv will) 
information, and ready wit made him an ideal 
partner; and Harry S. Parker III, Director of the 
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, who several 
years ago recognized immediately the potential 
importance of the project and lent support 
throughout its long development. Also crucial to 
the fruitful realization of the exhibition and its 
accompanying catalogue are those scholars who 
shared their knowledge through insightful essays 
and, in many cases, provided support and infor- 
mation far exceeding that expected of an essayist: 
Brigitte Baer, Michele Cone, Michael FitzGerald, 
Lydia Gasman, and Gertje Utley. A sabbatical 
leave granted by Harry Parker and the Sabbatical 
Committee of the Fine Arts Museums of San 
Francisco allowed me to travel to France for 
critically important research in the summer and 
autumn of 1!)!)/, a trip made possible by a grant 
from Robert and Carole McNeil of San Francisco. 
For all of their help with loans, organizational 
advice, and access to crucial materials in their 
museum archives, I am especially indebted to the 
staff at the Musee Picasso in Paris: Gerard Regnier, 
Director; Brigitte Leal, former Curator; Helene 
Seckel, Curator; Dominique Dupuis-Labbe, 
Curator; and Anne Baldessari, Curator of Arclm es 
and Library, and her extremely helpful stall. 
especially Sylvie Fresnault. From staff members 
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New 
York, Robert Rosenblum and 1 enjoyed invaluable 



cooperation and help, but I especially want to 
thank Thomas Krens, Director; Lisa Dennison, 
Deputy Director and Chief Curator; Fiona Ragheb, 
Assistant Curator; and Diane Dewey, Administrative 
Assistant. The long process of archival and bibli- 
ographic research for the exhibition was greatly 
facilitated by the helpful cooperation of staff at the 
Library and Archives of the Hoover Institution for 
War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University, 
who also lent materials to a historical gallery to 
provide an introduction and contextualization for 
the Picasso exhibition, and the Stanford University 
Art Library. I am particularly grateful to Elena 
Danielson, Archivist at the Hoover Institution, and 
Alexander Ross, Head Librarian at the Stanford 
University Art Library. Of course, no exhibition is 
possible without the participation of lenders. To the 
many individuals and institutions who generously 
parted with valued treasures long enough for them 
to appear in the exhibition, we are profoundly 
grateful. They are all acknowledged elsewhere in 
this catalogue. 

Certain colleagues who played particularly key 
roles in the conceptualization and development 
phases deserve special recognition and thanks: 
to Brigitte Baer (again) for giving me the courage 
to proceed with what seemed at the outset to be 
an impossibly difficult project; Maya Widmaier 
Picasso, for sharing with me her memories of 
life with her father during the Occupation; Kirk 
Varnedoe, for assisting with loans in a way that 
went far and beyond the call of duty; Albert Elsen, 
in memoriam, for first introducing me to the 
depths of meaning behind Picasso's Man with a 
Lamb; Ichiro Suyama, for the extraordinarily help- 
ful role he played in facilitating loans from Japan; 
and Carol Nash, who helped with the project in 
untold ways. 

The following all assisted with research, loan 
arrangements, photography procurements, or some 
other aspect of the project: William Acquavella, 
Doris Ammann, Alexander Apsis, Mami Asano,

ual listed, I am most grateful. To anyone I have 
inadvertently omitted, I offer my apologies for 
the oversight. 

Many staff members at the Fine Arts Museums 
of San Francisco have worked long and hard on 
this exhibition and catalogue. I am deeply grateful 
to them for their professionalism and dedication, 
and for the team spirit with which they approached 
the project. In particular, I would like to acknowl- 
edge the following: Kathe Hodgson, Director of 
Exhibitions Planning, supervised many of the logis- 
tics of exhibition administration; Karen Kevorkian, 
Editor of the Museums' Publications Department, 
copyedited the catalogue and managed the myriad 
details of its production in collaboration with Ann 
Karlstrom, Director of Publications and Graphic 
Design; Exhibition Assistants Danny Hobson and 
Laurel Fredrickson provided indispensable help

with historical research, compilation of loan records 
and photographs, and manuscript preparation; 
Bill White, Exhibitions Designer, oversaw the 
exhibition installation, and Bill Huggins, Lighting 
Designer, managed the lighting; Therese Chen. 
Director of Registration, managed the assemblage 
of loans and tour arrangements, including details 
of shipping, couriers, insurance, and National 
Indemnification; Allison Pennell, Librarian, tracked 
down many bibliographic references; Ron Rick, 
Chief Designer, provided the exhibition graphics; 
Vas Prabhu, Director of Education, helped organize 
the ambitious program of educational activities 
connected with the exhibition; Carl Grimm, Head 
Paintings Conservator, and others on the conserva- 
tion staff, including Tricia O'Regan, Assistant, pro- 
vided conservation examinations of the paintings 
and worked skillfully to return certain of the works 
in the exhibition to more presentable condition; 
Elisabeth Cornu, Objects Conservator, and Debra 
Evans, Paper Conservator, helped with conserva- 
tion and installation matters; Barbara Boucke, 
Director of Development, and Debbie Small, for- 
mer Development Associate, both worked on rais- 
ing funds for the exhibition; Joseph McDonald, 
Photographer, provided new photography for the 
catalogue; Suzy Peterson, Secretary to the Chief 
Curator, in addition to assisting with the prepara- 
tion of catalogue manuscripts, helped in innu- 
merable tasks connected with research and 
documentation; Pamela Forbes, Director of Media 
Relations, and Barbara Traisman, Media Relations 
Officer, coordinated all public relations and 
advertising programs; Sherin Kyte, Legion 
Administrator, oversaw logistics at the California 
Palace of the Legion of Honor, where the exhibi- 
tion took place in San Francisco. Michael Sumner 
contributed his considerable talent to the design 
of the catalogue, assisted by Melody Sumner 
Carnahan; meticulous editorial assistance was ren- 
dered by Frances Bowles and Sharon Vonasch. The 
skills and high standards of all of these individuals 
were clearly manifested in all aspects of the project. 

Of course, the exhibition would not have been 
possible without the generous financial support of 
several sponsors. For their underwriting and the 



confidence they showed in our proposals, we 
are most grateful to the National Endowment 
for the Arts and the National Endowment for 
the Humanities, Federal agent ies, and for 
indemnification of the exhibition, to the Federal 
Council on the Arts and Humanities.

Introduction: 
Picasso, War, and Art 



Steven A. Nash 



. . . artists who live and work with spiritual 
values cannot and should not remain indifferent 
to a conflict in which the highest values of 
humanity and civilization art at risk. 
-Picasso to tho Ann-: u .in At lists' Congress, I! 1 17 

No, painting is not made to decorate apartments. 
It is an offensive and defensive instrument 
of war against the enemy.

Wa 



'ar as a subject rarely makes for 
great art. The horrifying reality of 
humans slaughtering humans too easily over- 
whelms artistic efforts to witness or memorialize 
such events, rendering trivial the results. One thinks 
of Goya, Delacroix, Callot, and Rubens as artists of 
earlier epochs who managed to convey the pain, 
loss, and degradation of war in ways forever com- 
pelling. In the twentieth century, this "era of vio- 
lence," as Churchill put it, where war has reached 
previously unimaginable dimensions of destruction, 
the challenge to artists is more important but more 
daunting than ever. Society relies most commonly 
on the chilling, on-the-spot immediacy of photog- 
raphy and film to feed its collective understanding 
and memory of war. We must ask if it is really possi- 
ble for sculptors or painters to take the measure of 
horrors such as Dachau or Hiroshima. 

Picasso, for the most part, did not try. Aside 
from his great Guernica of 1937 and Charnel House 
of 1945-46, which respond respectively to the 
savage Nazi bombing of a Basque town and to 
news of the German concentration camps, his work 
from the war-torn years of 1937 to 1945 essentially 
ignores specific world events. Yet no other artist of 
the twentieth century left so sustained and moving 



a visual record of the corrosive effect of war on 
the human spirit and its toll on human life. His 
achievement was to create a modern alternative to 
history painting. As he explained to an American 
war correspondent who sought him out at his 
studio in Paris just days after its liberation: 

/ have not painted the war because I am not the 
kind of painter who goes out like a photographer for 
something to depict. But I have no doubt that the 
war is in these paintings I have done. Later on per- 
haps the historians will find them and show that 
my style has changed under the war's influence. 
Myself I do not know. 1 

His "style," in fact, did not change dramatically to 
accommodate this new expressive task. The basics 
of the visual vocabulary he employed throughout 
the war years - the stylizations, spatial disruptions, 
deformations of natural form, and coloristic 
choices - are evidenced in one way or another in 
earlier work. What changed were the degrees of 
exaggeration to which Picasso pushed them and 
the personal messages they served. Through a 
repertoire of traditional themes - still life, portrai 
ture, landscape, and the nude - Picasso referenced 



13 



the war in ways often oblique but powerful. A dark 
mood entered his work, not totally unrelieved 
by brighter, more hopeful, and even humorous 
moments, but tending toward a bleak, dimly lit 
world of contorted forms, claustrophobic spaces, 
and grayed-down colors, in which recurring icono- 
graphies build a picture of life strained to the brink 
of survival and beyond. As Picasso put it, in a 
typically trenchant remark about his expressive 
language during the war years, "you see, a casse- 
role too can scream."' Through his treatment of 
quotidian subjects, refracted through the lens of 
private trauma, he captured a portrait of an era 
that rises above the strictly personal to comment 
memorably on life in the shadow of war and the 
spiritual negativism that resulted, when traditional 
religion was futile and the ancient furies, all too 
alive for Picasso, wreaked havoc on humanity. The 
more narrowly autobiographical or hermetic focus 
of much of Picasso's art at this point expands into 
a give-and-take with history and an interaction 
with momentous world events. 

THE POLITICALIZATION OF PICASSO'S ART 

Picasso's productivity during the years 1937-45 
remained surprisingly high, despite the social 
upheavals going on around him. Throughout the 
Spanish Civil War, which he experienced only from 
a distance, his routines of work and relaxation fol- 
lowed long-established patterns, with most of the 
fall, winter, and spring seasons spent in Paris and 
summers on the Riviera. Early in 1937 he estab- 
lished a new studio in the seventeenth-century 
mansion at 7, rue des Grands- Augustins (fig. 1), but 
he also continued to live and work at his apartment 
at 23, rue La Boetie for several more years and to 
make occasional visits to his studio in Ambroise 
Vollard's home at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre. Even 
after the outbreak of World War II, during the twelve 
months Picasso spent in the coastal town of Royan 
and the four years in occupied Paris, he continued 
to turn out work with accustomed profusion.

Although he went through certain periods when he 
produced little or nothing, the overall record is 
remarkable. His cataloguer Christian Zervos lists 
over 2,200 paintings and drawings for the nine years 
spanning the Spanish Civil War and World War II, 
and Zervos's compilation is far from exhaustive. 

Clearly, the psychological stress of the times 
actually stimulated Picasso's creative instincts 
rather than blunting them. He had ample opportu- 
nity to leave France before and after its invasion by 
Germany in June 1940, but chose not to. Although 
this decision was made more out of passivity than 
any heroic instinct — "I'm not looking for risks to 
take," he told Francoise Gilot, "but in a sort of 
passive way I don't care to yield to either force or 
terror"' - it submitted him to the difficulties of life 
in France under the Occupation, with the normal 
hardships of food and fuel shortages, blackouts, 
and curfews, exacerbated by Picasso's status as a 
foreigner and a "degenerate" artist who was subject 
to regular Nazi surveillance. The intriguing but 
complex and only partially known story of 
Picasso's position vis-a-vis the Occupation regime 
will be surveyed later. Of primary importance is 
the fact that making art constituted for Picasso, in 
and of itself, a declaration of free will and a sign 
of human perseverance. His subject matter was 
not ostensibly antiwar or anti- German. It did not 
"scream out the truth," as one Resistance writer in 
Paris exhorted her fellow writers to do.' Given the 
scrutiny under which he worked, expressing too 
blatantly political a message would have been 
foolhardy for Picasso even if he were inclined to a 
more activist role, which he was not, and efforts by 
some writers to make of him a Resistance worker 
greatly exaggerate the facts. But in its own way, 
his work became a private resistance effort, one 
that carried strong symbolic value for friends and 
other artists trapped within the same excoriating 
circumstances. Through its inward journey, it 
opens a unique window onto the trauma of war 
and the pressures of life in occupied Paris. 

The radicalization of Picasso's art that led to this 
unique chronicle can be traced to the intensifying 
political situation in Europe in the mid- 1930s. 
Although much debate has centered on the issue 



14 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



of political and social meanings in Picasso's 
earlier art, and while it must be recognized that 
such meanings do exist to varying degrees, it also 
must be acknowledged that they are distinctly 
understated and are far from the type of "instru- 
ment of war against the enemy" that Picasso 
eventually prescribed. It is wise to keep in mind 
Roland Penrose's observation that the "the lan- 
guage of politicians was as foreign to him as the 
speech of distant tribes." All of that changed in 
the mid-1930s. 

As Hitler solidified his power in Germany, social 
unrest increased dramatically in France and Spain 
alike, becoming particularly widespread during the 
short reign of the Popular Front governments in 
both countries. From February 1936 to Franco's 
military mutiny in July that precipitated the 
Spanish Civil War, Picasso's homeland experi- 
enced 1 13 general strikes, 218 partial strikes, and 
the burning of over 200 churches and newspapers. 
Picasso's sensitivity to the deteriorating political 
situation in Europe was more acute than it had 
been in similar situations in the past. Undoubtedly 
this was due in part to Spain's involvement but it 
was also perhaps attributable to his closer align- 
ment with the Communist Party through respected 
friends who were members, and his growing con- 
viction that the Communists were an important 
revolutionary force against some of the social 
evils he cared most about. This conviction was 
cemented by the strong antifascist support the 
Communist Party threw behind the Republican 
government in the civil war, which eventually, in 
fact, dominated the Loyalist effort. As is frequently 
pointed out, Picasso's Composition with Minotaur, a 
gouache from 28 May 1936 that provided a curtain 
design for Romain Rolland's play Le 14 juillel 
(page 70, fig. 1), translates political sentiment into 
a mythological scene featuring a dead or dying 
minotaur held by a fearsome griffin-headed preda- 
tor (read "fascism"). A slightly later study from 
18 June (page 71, fig. 2) brings the focus resound- 
ingly up-to-date with the presence of a throng of 
protesters who assault a burning building, brandish 
the hammer and sickle, and exhort one another 
with raised fists." Numerous other works from 1936

express a sociopolitical awareness beneath the veil 
of mythologized subjects and the recurring themes 
of death, sacrifice, and destruction. Particularly 
significant is Picasso's killing of the minotaur, his 
alter ego through whom he had unleashed over 
the years so much basic instinctual passion, from 
bestiality and lust to tender love. In April 1936, 
Picasso had his minotaur pack up and move, 
pulling a handcart behind him. In several later 
compositions, he is slain in combat or in sports 
arenas." 1 Clearly, Picasso's worlds, internal and 
external, were changing. 

One of the earliest works in which this general- 
ized ennui became more specifically focused is the 
intriguing Figure of 28 January 1937 cat. do. 3 . 
In three drawings from this date, Picasso put on 
display an amply endowed, fashionably dressed

woman with a grotesquely, phallically distorted 
face." In Figure, she is immobilized like a man- 
nequin on an upright, tripod prong aimed 
menacingly at her sex, while she tongue-kisses a 
black-masked, putrid sun (the soleil pourri of 
surrealist fame). In her hands she holds a banner 
on which are drawn the two arms of a drowning 
victim, while she ignores the plight of the creature 
actually drowning at her side. Given Picasso's 
patriotic loyalties, might not this scenario be best 
interpreted as la France, a vain but impotent and 
hypocritical consort of evil, who by its non- 
interventionist policies ignored the plight of the 
Spanish Republicans? 12 

Such a polemical reading is credible given the 
seething attack on Franco and his pillaging Fascist 
troops that Picasso delivered several weeks before 
in his etchings entitled the Dream and Lie of Franco 
(cat. no. 2). This set of serial images, made to be 
cut up and sold as postcards or as a folio in support 
of the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign, has its 
iconographical roots in pictorial traditions of reli- 
gious and military processions, to which Goya 
among many others importantly contributed. n 
Picasso's title represents another memory of Goya, 
recalling the Dream of Lies and Inconstancy in 
Los Caprichos. While it is often commented that 
Picasso's prints may take a cue from political car- 
toons common in the French newspapers of the 
day or from the traditional Spanish aleluyas, u his 
long-standing admiration for Alfred Jarry and the 
scatological mayhem of the Ubu plays surfaces 
here as well. 1 ' The tuberous, polyplike form that 
Picasso gave Franco bears a striking resemblance 
to the strange creature in Dora Maar's 1936 photo- 
graph of Pere Ubu. u ' When Alfred Barr wrote to 
Picasso in 1945 asking him if Franco in these etch- 
ings had been inspired by Ubu, his secretary Jaime 
Sabartes wrote back that "II affirme s'etre inspire 
par l'ETRON," meaning roughly that Picasso 
affirmed the influence of "the old turd." 17 

Similarities have been pointed out between 
Franco and some of Jarry's own illustrations of his 
iconoclastic protagonists, and those of other artists 
seem relevant as well (see fig. 2), although Picasso 
had prefigured the tuberous form of Franco in

(XXe siecle), (Paris: Ambroise Vollard, 1901). 



drawings as early as April and May of 1936. IS 
Picasso worked on the two plates for the etch- 
ings in early January and again in June, after the 
Nazi bombing of Guernica, adding at that time 
the four final images that relate to his painting on 
this other subject. The narrative that the images 
describe is not precisely clear, and the poem that 
Picasso appended to the set does not shed much 
light on its meaning. The overall message, how- 
ever, is unmistakable. In Franco's persona of 
crowned ugliness, his slaying of horses and con- 
frontation with a bull (Picasso's typical symbols of 
the Spanish people and tradition), his destruction 
of beauty both in the forms of a classicized monu- 
ment and a beautiful young girl, and his hypocriti- 
cal invocation of religious mission, he emerges as 
emblematic of the evil of the military, church, and 
monarchy all in one, a traitor to Spanish tradition 
and a destroyer of its culture and people. 

Given the vehemence of this attack, it is surpris- 
ing that Picasso, when asked around the middle of 
January 1936 by the Republican government to 
prepare a mural for the Spanish Pavilion that was 
due to open in May at the World's Fair in Paris, 
chose at first a nonpolitical theme. The earliest 



16 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



sketches he prepared for the project date from IS 
and If) April. They show that he reverted at first to 
the standard, politically benign theme of an artist 
and his model in a studio," although in two of 
these sketches Picasso appended a raised arm hold- 
ing a hammer and sickle to the body of his earlier 
sculpture called the Orator, indicating that the 
theme of protest was also on his mind. That so 
few drawings exist from this stage of work reveals 
both that Picasso was procrastinating and that he 
remained indecisive and uninspired over how to 
fill the dauntingly large canvas (almost 11% by 26 
feet) that was expected of him. 

The saturation bombing of the Basque town of 
Guernica and its civilian population by the Nazis' 
Condor Legion on 26 April provided Picasso the 
meaningful theme he previously lacked. It was a 
subject grounded in the immediacy of horrifying" 
world events but rich in potential for a humanistic 
protest against the senseless violence of war in 
general. He set to work with remarkable energy. 
His first sketches date from 1 May, when the news 
of what happened in Guernica was still echoing out 
in sometimes contradictory news accounts, and he 
turned over his completed canvas to the organizers 
of the Spanish Pavilion a little more than a month 
later, well before the delayed opening of the 
pavilion on 12 July. 20 

The story of Picasso's development of his com- 
position through many drawings and different 
stages of work on the canvas is well known, and 
the final painting has been analyzed from many 
points of view. In the present volume, Gertje Utley 
examines the complicated political tensions among 
differing factions and loyalties within the Repub- 
lican cause at this time, and questions Picasso's 
precise political motivation. Robert Rosenblum 
shows how Goya, as an ever-present influence on 
Picasso during the war years, figured significantly 
among the many sources he drew upon in con 
structing his great vision of terror and destruction, 
and how his imagery ferociously subverts traditional 
Catholic iconography. For a survey of Picasso's over- 
all wartime production, Guernica (pages 40-41, fig. 1) 
clearly is a landmark achievement that spawned 
many ideas he further developed and that opened 



the \\a\ for much ol the work that followed, 

The stark grisaille palette ol the painting, fo] 
example, that contributes so much to its nocturnal 
eeriness and helps raise it from the arena of actual, 
colorful, organic life into a realm of abstract icon, 
very early set the tone of drab gravness permeating 
many of Picasso's wartime paintings and drawings. 
Although foreshadowed in certain earlier works, 
and undoubtedly influenced by black-and white 
photographs and new si eels, this absence of color 
became a main signifier in Picasso's work during 
the war years, connoting a long, purgatorial winter 
of the soul that continued, in fact, although less 
insistently, into the difficult postwar years of recon 
sanction. Several emblematic images in the paint 
ing - the crying woman, the largely disembodied 
bull's head, the pointed tongue as a sign of 
anguish, the torturously distorted hands and feet - 
have long afterlives in other works. Perhaps most 
importantly, the imagery has a complex, multilevel 
quality that avoids direct description and defies 
easy interpretation, another salient feature of 
Picasso's wartime production. To a journalist 
visiting him just after the liberation of Paris he 
suggested specific symbolic meanings for the horse 
and bull, while to Alfred Barr Picasso insisted that 
they were just a horse and just a bull. " Such mas- 
terworks from the years that follow as Woman with 
a Cock, L'Aubade, Charnel House (cat no. 82), and 
Man with a Lamb (cat. no. ()()), have a similar com- 
bination of gripping visual imagery and elusive or 
multivalenced meaning. Although specific 
connotations such as sacrifice, isolation, fear, 
or suffering may be communicated, Picasso's 
approach is always intuitive rather than program- 
matic, and therefore a single, unequivocal reading 
of his symbolism is rarely possible. Ambiguit) ga\ e 
Picasso the desired effect of leaving freedom of 
interpretation to the public. It does not matter that 
a viewer of Guernica may be unfamiliar with the 
history of Nazi involvement in the Spanish Civil 
War, or that the bull in Guernica can be interpreted 
alternatively as victim or aggressor. The true mean- 
ing of the painting is lifted out of space and time 
coordinates in the civil war to become a summa 
on all wars and all victims. 



STEVKN A. NASH 17 



Picasso's preoccupation with tragedy in Guernica 
gave way after its completion to themes of a more 
lighthearted nature — landscapes, still lifes, portraits 
of friends and family — but he also continued to 
express his sentiments about the war in Spain, 
primarily through his long series of paintings and 
graphics on the theme of the Weeping Woman (see 
cat. nos. 7-11, 14). 23 A famous group of prints on 
the subject, featuring images with both autobio- 
graphical and political associations, dates from 
early in July 1937. They are often referred to as 
portraits of Dora Maar, who had become Picasso's 
mistress and was regularly present in his studio 
during work on Guernica — she photographed its 
seven main stages of development — and whose 
high-strung emotionalism caused Picasso to think 
of her as "always . . . weeping." '' They also hark 
back, however, to events in Spain. Picasso's crying 
woman is undoubtedly the release of his own 
lament for all the pain and suffering experienced 
by the populace of Spain, his own family included. 
Barcelona, where Picasso's mother and sister lived, 
was a center of the Republican movement that 
became one of the main theaters of action. It is 
possible to tie the image of the weeping woman to 
the news Picasso received from his mother about 
street disturbances in the civil outbreaks of May 

1937, which described the way that smoke from 
fires made her eyes tear and nearly asphyxiated the 
family.' ' That Picasso's father had made one of the 
sculptural mater dolorosae so common in Spain, 
complete with glass tears, 2 '' a work the family kept 
for many years, must have increased for the artist 
the poignancy of the crying motif and its associa- 
tions with home. Brigitte Baer has also shown that 

a work as seemingly apolitical as the large print 
Woman with a Tambourine (cat. nos. 25, 26), with its 
self-conscious borrowings from Poussin's Bacchanal 
before a Herm and Degas's bathers, also couches 
veiled references to contemporary events, in 
particular, the street fighting in Spain. 27 

BETWEEN THE WARS 

The war in Spain continued into 1939, but the 
tide had turned against the Republicans by spring 

1938. While Picasso generously supported various 



relief efforts with cash and the donation of works, 
feeling on a deeply personal level his country's 
tragedy, 28 the civil war tended to become a more 
distant referent in his art from late 1937 onward. 
In this period, leading up to the outbreak of World 
War II in September 1939, his work settled into a 
state of uneasy quietude, during which images of a 
seemingly pleasurable character — brightly painted 
seated women, bathing scenes, domestic genres - 
were balanced by still-life compositions that 
contemplate such major themes as death, the arts, 
culture, and civilization. Frequently, however, 
even his more outwardly hedonistic compositions 
feature a highly stylized distortion or a dense inter- 
weave of pattern and weblike lines that convey 
confinement, entrapment, or tense emotional 
states. Together with the still lifes, the gathering 
malaise in such works corresponds to the deteriora- 
tion of the political situation in Europe as the 
continent plunged toward total war. The culminat- 
ing expression of this distress is the great Night 
Fishing at Antibes (fig. 4 and cat. no. 31). On the 
one hand, it is an innocent scene of two pretty 
girls watching men fishing at night by the light 
of lanterns, and on the other, it is an apocalyptic 
vision of bursting bombs, death, and erotic fervor. 
Three outstanding still-life paintings in this vol- 
ume display the syncretistic thinking on themes 
of life and death that characterize this period: Still 
Life with Palette, Candlestick, and Head of a Minotaur 
from 4 November 1938 (cat. no. 23), Still Life 
with Candle, Palette, and Black Bull's Head from 
19 November 1938 (cat. no 24), and Bull's Skull, 
Fruit, and Pitcher horn 29 January 1939 (cat. no. 27). 
Sobering notes of memento mori infuse all three 
through the decapitated heads of the bull and 
minotaur (neutralized into sculptures on bases) 
and the desiccated bull's skull. As iconographical 
and compositional counterpoints to these emblems 
of death, Picasso stationed candles in two of the 
works, the irradiating light offering a vision of 
illumination and hope. In the third, he provided a 
juxtaposition of ripe and glowing fruit, a colorful 
pitcher, and a tree in blossom, all talismans of 
regenerative life. Open books surmounted by 
palettes and brushes proclaim the powerful life 



18 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



force of the arts. The colors in all three tend 
toward a high-keyed, even garish range of blue, 
green, yellow, and red, another sign of Picasso's 
basically optimistic expectations of the triumph of 
good over evil and life over death. 

Such works as the Seated Woman of 29 August 
1!)38, and the two drawings of Bathers with Crab 
and Three Figures, horn 10 July and 10 August lf)38, 
respectively (cat. nos. 21, 1!), 20), exemplify the 
linear constriction often seen in Picasso's figure 
style during these years. The entire pictorial space 
is enmeshed in a fine web of lines and pattern. In 
the two drawings, Picasso's compulsive covering 
of all forms and even open spaces with dark lines 
from his sharp-tipped pen is particularly suggestive 
of the webbing of a fishing net. The painting of the 
Seated Woman is a riot of intersecting patterns of line 
and color tightly confined within the surrounding

time pleasures, and recall earlier times in l'u asso's 
life and work when the political atmosphere was 
less strained. But the horror vacuioi their constnn 
tion hints at psychological rumblings below the 
hedonistic surface. 

This double edge in Picasso's work from 
1938-39 is particularly apparent in his two master- 
pieces of the period. Woman with a Cockoi 15 
February 1!)38 and Night Fishing at Antibes, finished 
just before Germany invaded Poland (figs. 3-1 . 
In the former, the somewhat moronic appearance 
of the woman holding the rooster (it is often 
remarked that her features resemble Picasso's at 
this time of his life) is at first disarming. Gradually, 
however, the brutishness of the image makes itself 
felt through the figure's elephantine head, hands, 
and legs, the tight grip on the bird, and the proffer- 
ing of a cup to catch the sacrificial blood, all 
intensifying the anticipation of a ritualistic killing. 
The woman takes on more and more the identitv 
of a seated priestess whose plying of death is 
routine and heartless. 

Such imagery provides a clue to the true mean 
ing of the large Night Fishing at Antibes, a work thai 
has been analyzed from almost as main different 
interpretive points of view as Guernica. B\ now, 
it seems clear that it is far more than the innocent 
summer idyll or an exposition of heatedlv sexual 
gamesmanship that some authors suggest. 
Especially when considered in the context of 
earlier and later war-related works, it looms as 
a haunting prophecy of impending doom. 

The painting was started inauspiciously enough. 
In strolls around the quays of Antibes with Dora 
Maar, Picasso had witnessed scenes of fishermen 
working in their boats in the harbor at night, 
spearing fish lured to the water's surface b\ the 
bright light of their lanterns. This motif became 
Picasso's point of departure. At the right side ol

the composition, he inserted two brightly dressed 
young women standing along the ramparts of the 
harbor, identified by Dora Maar as herself and 
her artist friend Jacqueline Lamba, wife of Andre 
Breton." In the background to the left can be seen 
two towers, one from the chateau Grimaldi, later to 
become the Musee Picasso, and the other a 
nearby bell tower. 32 

It has been suggested that the composition may 
owe something to a boating scene of Bathers in the 
Louvre attributed to Nicolaes Maes, 13 but a closer 
parallel is found in a painting by Nicolaes Berchem 
entitled Landscape with Crab Catchers by Moonlight 
(fig. 5), widely known through engravings by 
Dancker Danckerts and Francois Denis Nee. 34 The 
symbolism of fishermen in a boat, of course, has 
particularly strong Christian connotations. One 
pictorial example of this tradition that could have 
attracted Picasso's attention is the fresco of the 
Miraculous Draft of Fishes in San Pedro de Sorpe in 
Catalonia, published by Picasso's close friend 
Christian Zervos in 1937 in his book on Catalonian 
art (fig. 6). 35 Picasso's general interest in early 
Catalonian art is well documented, and further 
comparisons can be drawn, for example, between 
the flattened, simplified rendering of the fish and 
crab in Night Fishing and denizens of the deep 
in the Apocalypse tapestry in the Cathedral of 
Girona, also published by Zervos. ' 



The relevance of Christian teachings of the 
Apocalypse and Christ the fisherman, with its 
converse reference of Christ as fish and sacrificial 
victim, takes on greater probability in light of 
Picasso's distinct interpretive twist on his subject. 
His nighttime lighting, shot through with blacks, 
dark blues, and purples, has its own deeply omi- 
nous effect. The lights around the boat do not just 
glow, but, rather, explode with light, much like 
shells bursting in air. The two fishermen, one leer- 
ing over the edge of the boat and the other poised, 
about to drive his four-pronged spear into a fish, 
have a savage, menacing quality. And the thrusting 
of the spear, highlighted in the lower center of the 
composition, provides the central theme visually 
and figuratively, summoning thoughts of sudden 
death from above that we cannot help but link to 
the menace of wartime bombardment. Even the 
two girls become caught up in the frenzy of explo- 
sive emotion. As if the message behind the one on 
the right obscenely licking the double ice-cream 
with her pointed tongue were not clear enough, 
Picasso represented her head as a giant phallus, 
perhaps, as he had many times in the past, correlat- 
ing sex and violence, ecstasy and death. Another 
note on mortality is sounded by the triangular flut- 
tering moths that swarm around the boat, attracted 
to their deaths by the light of the lamps. These 
brightly lit creatures and the lamps, too, seem to be

as much celestial bodies as earthly objects, adding 
to the scene another portentous quality of some- 
thing "read in the stars." 

The largest canvas Picasso painted for many 
years after Guernica, Night Fishing at Antibes is also 
one of the most telling documents of his own fears 
of war and the ferocity of aerial bombardment. It 
is an amazingly prescient anticipation of the blitz- 
krieg about to be unleashed on Europe. 

THE HOLOCAUST BEGINS: PICASSO IN ROYAN 

That Picasso was expecting the political situation in 
Europe to deteriorate further in \\)M is shown by 
his dispatch of Marie-Therese and Maya to summer 
in the coastal town of Royan, north of Bordeaux. 
Not only was Royan distant from possible military 
targets, it also was well situated if a sudden exodus 
from France by boat were deemed necessary. Just 
a few days after returning to Paris from Antibes, 
Picasso himself departed for Royan with his 
chauffeur Marcel, Sabartes and his wife, Dora 
Maar, and his dog Kazbek. 

Provincial life generally did not agree with 
Picasso, at least in large doses, but he would remain 



in Royan for almost a year, with fairl) frequent nips 
back to Paris to keep in touch with developments 
there. Except for occasional landscapes oi works 
based on personal experience, such as the draw ings 
inspired by Picasso's observations oi horses being 
led along rural roadways for the dismal prospects 
of military service, 38 his work in Royan isnol place- 
specific. Instead, starting almost immediatel) aftei 
his arrival, it mirrored through familiar subject 
matter a new depth of despair and anguish that 
connects directly to the outbreak of World War II. 
This work set the tone of Picasso's output for the 
next several years. 

In an album of drawings Picasso began on 30 
September, the first pages are devoted to grim 
sketches of a flayed sheep's head, which lead com- 
positionally to the large ink drawing of 1 ( )ctober 
(cat. no. 34). M Isolated in inky blackness, monu- 
mental in presence and unflinching in its portrayal 
of cold, hard lifelessness, this drawing introduces a 
series of still-life compositions with skulls that date 
mostly from early in the Royan period (cat. nos. 
34-37). Whereas Picasso had moderated his 
memento mori subjects from \9'AH with the hope- 
filled symbols of books, palettes, and candles, these 
still lifes dating after the outbreak of World War II 
are single-mindedly, unremittingly concerned with 
one subject - death. Skulls either bleached white. 
or red with the blood of flesh, are shown singly, 
or combined with a slab of meat, or piled with an 
insouciant disregard of balance that mocks even 
more the dumb victims of recent violence. Devoid 
of any interrupting details, the surrounding spaces 
in these works sometimes have a glow of hot red 
or orange that increases even more their emotional 
intensity. In their starkness, these works relate back 
to Goya's still-life paintings of butchered animal 
parts and Cezanne's compositions of skulls." For 
Picasso, they mark the first of a lengthy series of 
varied works on the motif of the skull, both animal 
and human, that runs throughout the war years 
and provides a primary vehicle of expression. 

Stylistically, these Royan still lifes displax a 
generally harsh or purposefulK crude drawing oi 
form and paint handling that reinforces the blunl 
ness of message. Another st\ listic and iconographic

departure of the period is the darkly limned, tortur- 
ous deformations of female anatomy that set in, 
embodying the distorting, transformative powers 
of wartime emotion. In a relaxed mood, when he 
was drawing his young daughter Maya, for exam- 
ple, Picasso might reprise a delicately classicizing 
mode from earlier years." Generally, however, the 
women in his art from this time take on a mon- 
strous quality, with heads reworked into dog faces 
or skulls and bodies verging more toward skeletons 
or cadavers than living creatures. In some sketches 
(e.g., fig. 7), we seem to witness the evolution of a 
relatively naturalistic head into a ghastly skull-like 
incubus. In reporting to Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 
an anecdote about one such work, Picasso admitted 
the subconscious proddings behind them: "When 
the Germans arrived in France, I was in Royan, 
and one day I did a portrait of a woman . . . and 
when the Germans arrived a few days later, I 



saw that the head resembled a German helmet." 42 
Such distortions look back to Picasso's work 
from the late 1920s, when surrealism rose as a 
powerful influence on his art and he responded 
with inventive female anatomies meant more to 
menace than to please. In the wartime period, 
however, Picasso somehow makes us feel that his 
figures are actually distorted humans rather than 
fictive, fully imaginary creations. The powerful 
disorientations that can result are evident, for 
example, in the famous Woman Dressing Her Hair 
in the Museum of Modern Art (fig. 8). Picasso here 
revisited a motif found repeatedly in his work in 
images of self-absorbed bathers, one that comes

ultimately from a long tradition of depictions of the 
Birth of Venus (see fig. 9). Nineteenth-century aca 
demic artists such as Adolphe-William Bouguereau 
and Louis Perrault had rendered the image of 
Venus wringing her hair as a sugary cliche, 1 but 
Picasso gave it the force of a battering ram. 

As we can now trace in Picasso's Royan sketch- 
books, this composition began early in If) 10 with 
a series of lithe, Matissian drawings of a nude with 
her arms raised, but by 1 I March it had evolved 
into a far more contorted form." Further studies for 
the figure date from 3-8 June HMO,' and a final 
overall sketch, which may actually postdate the 
painting, is inscribed H) June (fig. 10)." As William 



Rubin has pointed out, the purpose ol the extreme 
transfigurations in the imposing bather that Picasso 
finally committed to canvas was "to suggest psy&lt; hi* 

conflict through somatic dislocation." Confined 
within a tight, cell like space and illuminated 
against nighttime shadows b\ an a it i lie ial raking 
light, she looms powerfully, taking on all at once 
the personae of prisoner, victim, and oppressor. 
She is a mountain ol llcsh, but in Picasso's cold 
light seems to be as much carved stone as organi* 
matter. Her exposed ribs on one side suggest star 
\ation, while the massiveness of her elephantine 
legs, huge abdomen, and tumescent head and breasts 
lend her brute force. It has to be remembered that

Picasso worked on his canvas at the same time that 
Hitler was overrunning the Low Countries and 
crossing into France. Nightmares were coming true; 
to his, Picasso gave flesh and bones. 

Another good indication of the despair and 
shock that for Picasso accompanied the outbreak 
of war is found in such rapid notebook sketches as

linear sculptures made from armatures of wire or 
welded rods. Here, the hint of a figure inhabits the 
web, but it is absorbed into a flurry of disorienting

vectors and contradictory perspectives that build to 
a sense of all-enveloping chaos. In the other sketch, 
Picasso produced his own variation on a traditional 
religious theme that can be read as a gruesome 
Mother and Child or perhaps Mary Magdalen con- 
templating a skull (see fig. 13). The woman holds 
on her lap the skull of a sheep wrapped inauspi- 
ciously in newspaper. The large lace or ruffled collar 
suggests seventeenth-century attire, and the styliza- 
tions of the figure again express Picasso's interest in 
Romanesque art (compare fig. 12), although the 
radio and buffet in the background make it clear 
that this is really a contemporary drama. To add a 
darkly bitter and sardonic note, Picasso shows the 
woman wiggling her fingers through one eye socket 
and the open jaw of the victimized sheep. If any reli- 
gious significance resided in the motif for Picasso, it 
could only have been the mocking of Christ and, 
with it, Christian promises of salvation. 

PICASSO IN OCCUPIED PARIS 

Picasso could easily have fled France, had he 
chosen to do so. Specific offers to help him emi- 
grate came from Mexico and the United States, but 
perhaps the thought of all the difficulties involved 
in relocating himself, his art, and all the significant 
others in his life discouraged him from taking 
action. At any rate, he had decided by the summer 
of 1940 to remain in France, and on 23 August he 
left Royan to return permanently to Paris, Marie- 
Therese and Dora Maar following soon after. For 
a long while, Picasso split his time between his 
apartment in the rue La Boetie and studio in the 
rue des Grands- Augustins. Since travel across Paris 
had become more difficult with the Occupation, 
he finally transferred completely to the rue des 
Grands-Augustins, probably by early 1942. Dora 
Maar lived around the corner in the rue de Savoie, 
and he installed Marie-Therese and Maya in an 
apartment a short walk across the river on the 
boulevard Henri-IV. His son Paulo was living in 
Switzerland under the watchful eye of Bernhard 
Geiser, but his wife Olga, from whom he had 
separated in 1935, remained in Paris, at least at 
first, despite Picasso's efforts to persuade her also 
to relocate to Switzerland.

Picasso's activities in occupied Paris, and his 
conduct vis-a-vis the Occupation regime, have 
been the subject of much conjecture, supporters at 
one end of the spectrum trying to make of him a 
Resistance hero and critics at the other attempting 
to tar his reputation with accusations of collabora- 
tion." Neither extreme is accurate. Although 
Picasso's biography during the Occupation still 
remains an incomplete mosaic, based on scattered 
documentation and often secondhand reports, an 
overall picture has begun to emerge. It provides 
the image of an artist who tried to survive as best 
he could in order to continue his work. Picasso 
remained active in certain social and cultural 
circles, but attempted to keep a low profile to 
avoid attracting attention from those authorities 
in whose eyes he was a degenerate, foreign art i si 
linked more than any other figure to subversive, 
even "Jewish" factions of modern art Picasso 
lived under the oppressive weight of German sin 
veillance, manifested most blatantly by occasional 
searches of his studio bv Nazi soldiers. He was 



even summoned like other citizens to register for 
the Service de travail obligatoire (STO), which 
could have resulted in his transfer to German) for 
work as a laborer. ' It is clear that Picasso's finan- 
cial well being allowed for privileges that eased the 
discomfort of life made grim by Occupation short- 
ages, and that his status as a famous artist respected 
around the world brought from certain quarters 
a favoritism that, although difficult to identify 
precisely in terms of source, helped on occasion 
to keep him safe. In general, however, he sought to 
heed the advice of his friend Andre-Louis Dubois 
and try to "remain invisible."'' 

The public life of culture and the arts in occupied 
Paris was more plentiful than might be assumed. 
A look at the entertainment pages of a wartime 
newspaper such as Comoedia, for example, reveals 
just how lively the cultural world remained, with 
numerous concerts, theatrical presentations, art 
exhibitions, and films playing at an) one time. 
The artistic content was decidedlv conservative, 
and the criticism that accompanied it marked!) 
right wing, but, on the surface at least, an air 
of normality prevailed, even it much of the 



Ml \ l-N A. NASH U 



patronage came from Occupation forces. 

Picasso's role in this cultural scene obviously 
diminished from prewar levels, but remained 
significant. Books about him continued to appear, 
despite stringent censorship by the Germans, 
including Picasso: Seize peintures 1939-1943, with 
text by Robert Desnos, which came out late in 
1943, and the second volume of Christian Zervos's 
catalogue raisonne, which appeared in 1942. 
Picasso provided illustrations to several books of 
poetry and essays published during the war, such 
as Georges Hugnet's La Chevre-Feuille (Paris, 1943) 
and Robert Desnos's Contree (Paris, 1944). To the 
underground surrealist publication La Main a 
plume, he supplied financial support, illustrations, 
and a photograph of Head of a Bull for the cover of 
the summer 1942 issue. The dealer Martin Fabiani 
had taken over plans for the publication of Picasso's 
illustrations to Buffon's Histoire naturelle after 
Vollard's death in 1939, and managed to bring this 
famous project to fruition in 1942. Picasso also 
published the occasional print, as with the Galerie 
Louise Leiris edition of Combat in the Arena in 1943 
(cat. no. 12). Works by Picasso came up at public 
auction, sometimes fetching huge prices, and con- 
trary to what is often reported, paintings by Picasso 
frequently appeared in exhibitions in wartime 
Paris. i3 Picasso himself claimed that, owing to a 
request from the Spanish embassy for an interdic- 
tion, the Occupation authorities prohibited him 
from exhibiting publicly, and an often repeated 
story tells of the forced removal from public view 
of a painting by Picasso during an opening at the 
Galerie Charpentier. '' But while it is true that no 
one-man exhibition took place, his works could be 
seen in many shows around the city, and a fairly 
extensive behind-the-scenes commerce took place 
with his art, as Michael FitzGerald discusses in his 
essay in this book. Moreover, Picasso's name fre- 
quently appeared in the art press, most often as a 
target for reactionary diatribes by collaborationist 
critics but occasionally in more positive invoca- 
tions of his work as a standard of achievement. 

In his private life, Picasso also was far from 
reclusive. Sabartes and Brassai provide vivid 
accounts of the many visitors to Picasso's studio." 



He occasionally went to the cinema and theater 
and frequented the cafes around his quartier on the 
Left Bank, usually running into friends such as the 
Zervoses or Paul Eluard and his wife Nusch. He 
dined with friends almost every day at his favorite 
restaurants, Le Catalan in the same street as his 
studio and the nearby Le Savoyard. He was visited 
frequently by expatriate Spaniards, and his circle 
of friends and acquaintances included many of the 
most prominent writers, poets, and cultural figures 
of the day, some of them active to varying degrees 
in the Resistance movement, and some of them, 
like Jean Cocteau, collaborators. The cast of partic- 
ipants for the reading of Picasso's play Le De'sir 
attrape par la queue in March 1944, and the audi- 
ence that turned out to listen, is a who's who of the 
Parisian art and literary worlds. '" He could afford 
the luxury of a private secretary (not that he paid 
Sabartes highly), abundant art supplies, black- 
market chateaubriands at Le Catalan, and, it 
seems, adequate supplies of coal. With the help of 
friends he was able to accomplish some unlikely 
Occupation-era feats, such as the casting into 
bronze of several large sculptures at a time when 
bronze was not only in short supply but also was 
confiscated by the Germans as metal to support 
their war industry.' 7 

Although Picasso was able to maintain a degree 
of normality in his life, the war was always present. 
He felt direct, personal dangers posed by the 
Occupation. He was summoned, for example, to 
reveal to German officials the contents of his bank 
vault. ,H Less well known is the fact that, while 
Picasso was living in Royan, the Spanish embassy 
in Paris (where officials considered Picasso an 
enemy due to his anti-Franco stance) posted notices 
at both his apartment in the rue La Boetie and stu- 
dio in the rue des Grands-Augustins, claiming these 
properties for the protectorship of the embassy. '' 
Although Picasso showed both loyalty and resolve 
by attending the funerals of his Jewish friends 
Chaim Soutine and Max Jacob,'" he was not some- 
one with great personal courage when faced with 
threats from police or government agencies, and 
the prospect of enlistment by the STO must have 
been truly terrifying. Certainly, any visit he 



26 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



received at his studio by German troops was alarm 
ing. Francoise Gilot and Andre-Louis Dubois 
reported that they witnessed some of these visits, 
when searches were made of the studio and works 
damaged. Gilot tells of repeated German harass- 
ment under the pretext of searches for the sculptor 
Jacques Lipchitz. And while Picasso himself was 
not always reliable about such details, he told one 
interviewer just after the liberation of Paris that the 
last German visitation had been only weeks before." - ' 

Attacks in books and the press by collabora- 
tionist, anti-Semitic writers such as John Hemming 
Fry and Fritz Rene Vanderpyl would have 
contributed to this oppressive atmosphere. 63 In his 
19 VI book LArt sans patrie, un mensonge: Le pinceau 
d 'Israel, a Fascist diatribe against Jewish artists and 
their purportedly damaging effects on modern art, 
Vanderpyl made Picasso a special target by deceit- 
fully implying Jewish roots through his use of a 
Picasso painting as his frontispiece! And Picasso's 
former friend Maurice de Vlaminck, in his famous 
article vilifying Picasso in the 6 June 1!)42 issue of 
Comoedia, voiced the increasingly* common insinua- 
tion that Picasso and his work were somehow 
linked to the metaphysics of the Kabala and 
Talmud. " That Picasso had no Jewish blood in his 
family, and had to attest to this, like everyone else, 
when renewing his identity papers, did not deter 
his detractors. Such attacks, however, may have 
made him uneasy over the safety of his mistress 
Dora Maar, who is said to have been half Jewish. 

In the politically complex position that Picasso 
occupied in wartime Paris, might such pressures 
have caused him to exercise what influence he had 
for self protection? There is little doubt that, on 
certain occasions, one authority or another stepped 
forward to assist him. The threatened seizure of his 
property by the Spanish government passed with- 
out any known explanation. In the case of the even 
more consequential summons by the STO, we 
again have no record of how Picasso was able to 
avoid complying, although possibly his age - in 
1943 he was over the sixty-year-limit placed on 
workers — had much to do with it. Picasso's friend 
Maurice Toesca, who worked in the office of the 
prefecture, assisted with the renewal of his identity 



papers when Picasso wanted to avoid alerting the 
Germans and the Spanish embass) b) following 
normal procedures, but loesca was powerless at 

higher bureaucratic levels.' ( )ne possible source oi 
assistant e was the ( in man sculptor Arno Breker, a 
Nazi favorite whose retrospective in Paris in 19 [2 
became a showcase of National Socialist aesthetic s 

and fawning collaborationist enthusiasm. In Ins 
memoirs, slanted by self-sen ing claims of s\ mpatln 
for the French, Breker takes credit for protecting 
Picasso when he was accused of supplying mone) 
to the Communists in Spain and to Russia through 
Denmark. And Picasso also was on speaking 
terms with the two German officers Ernst Jiinger 
and Gerhard Heller, both cultured men who paid 
unwelcome but unavoidable visits to Picasso's 
studio.' The old story of a visit from the German 
ambassador Otto Abet/., to whose question about 
Guernica - "Did you do that?" — Picasso supposed!) 
answered, "No, you did," is apocryphal. s 

Given Picasso's hatred of fascism and fear of 
entanglement with government officials, it is highK 
unlikely that he would have sought any assistance 
directly, but his friends, especially Cocteau, might 
have appealed to German authorities on his behalf. 
Picasso always "kept his dignity," as Zervos later 
put it. The perception of compromise, however, 
fueled rumors of collaboration, lending a note of 
credibility to the old notion that Picasso's good 
friends in the Communist Party such as Aragon 
and Eluard later recruited him as a member and 
pushed him into the epuration proceedings parti) to 
erase any possible confusion over his wartime con 
tacts.'" Against those who might tar his reputation 
come the equallv indefensible claims that he 
played an active role with the Resistance or used 
his art as an aggressive propaganda agent. Picasso 
was a survivor. To survive was to work, which to 
him was all important, and this sheer determina- 
tion took on for fellow artists and friends in Pans 
an inspiring heroic value, a symbolism that spread 
alter the Liberation to a much broader realm. 
Jacques Prevert spoke gratefull) of Picasso's 
decision to stav in Paris as "an act of courage," 
and Louis Parrot wrote, "SoIeK b\ his presence 
among us, he gave hope to those who would 



si I \ IN A. NASII 



have ended up doubting our chances of survival," 
adding that his example warranted the thanks of 
all the intellectuals and artists of France.' 1 The 
acknowledgment that Christian Zervos wrote of 
Picasso's inspirational role during the war is even 
more revealing and moving for its frankness. To 
correct inflated reports of Picasso's involvement 
with the Resistance, Zervos wrote to Alfred Barr: 

Everything that has been recounted is bad journal- 
ism and for the most part false. The anecdotes are 
false. The participation of Picasso in the Resistance is 
false. Picasso simply preserved his dignity during the 
Occupation, as millions of people here did. But he 
never got involved in the Resistance. Consider that his 
work in itself is the greatest form of resistance, not 
only against an enemy but against millions of pre- 
tentious imbeciles. . . . Do not let yourself be influ- 
enced by nonexistent heroics. There were heroes in 
France, but they either paid with their lives or ask 
that there be silence for their actions? 1 

When an opportunity for public exposure of what 
Picasso had actually produced during the war finally 
came with the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, 
critical reception of the work had to contend with 
unusual forces. Picasso's international renown was 
suddenly greater than ever, but based on publicity 
rather than art. His new work, which had not been 
widely seen, held surprises even for his supporters, 
and strong political factors also came into play. 

Fighting had barely subsided in the streets of 
Paris when Picasso returned to his studio in the 
rue des Grands-Augustins from Marie-Therese's 
apartment on the Right Bank, where he had spent 
the last days of the conflict. While there, he 
produced his personal celebration of the street 
fighting and Liberation, an interpretive copy of 
Poussin's Triumph of Pan (figs. 22-23). 7 ' Almost 
immediately, Allied soldiers and war correspon- 
dents began to stream to Picasso's studio to meet 
him and pay their respects. Interviews quickly 
appeared in publications as varied as Art Digest, 
Vogue (with wonderful photographs by Lee Miller, 
see figure 14), The New Statesman and Nation, and 
the San Francisco Chronicle. 7 * 



Just weeks after the Liberation, the artist Andre 
Fougeron, a member of the French Communist 
Party and a Resistance worker, started develop- 
ing plans to honor Picasso at the 1944 Salon 
d'Automne, to become known popularly as the 
Liberation Salon." Such an exhibition offered the 
perfect opportunity to celebrate Picasso's work and 
also the symbolic values of free will and persever- 
ance against oppression for which it had come to 
stand, and the artist personally selected seventy- 
four paintings and five sculptures to show, all from 
recent years. A likely subtext eventually accompa- 
nying the plan was a capitalization on Picasso's 
prestige to further the cause of the Communist 
Party. Although Picasso had not yet committed 
himself to membership, at least not publicly, it is 
more than coincidental that his enlistment and its 
announcement took place with much fanfare on 
October 4 and 5, timed to precede the opening 
of the Salon d'Automne by just one day. 7 ' 1 

The plans laid by party officials in league with 
certain of Picasso's friends succeeded probably

28 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



more than they dared hope. The story is now well 
known of the anti-Picasso manifestation staged in 
the Salon galleries by a gang of mostly student- 
aged visitors, spurred by a combination of reac- 
tionary objections to Picasso's aesthetics and 
politics, in which numerous paintings were actually 
taken down from the walls. Political views aside, 
Picasso's wartime art would have come as a shock 
to many Parisians who were not overly familiar 
with his work in general, let alone the tormented 
vision of recent years, made even more aggressive 
by comparison with the pallid niceties seen 
throughout most of the rest of the Salon. In a rapid 
countermanifestation, other young people agreed 
to stand guard in the galleries. Letters of praise for 
Picasso from Le Front national des etudiants and 
Comite national des ecrivains appeared in the 
media, and various critics chimed in with support 
for Picasso and his political stance. 77 Simulta 
neously, Picasso received publicity in the newspa- 
pers for his contributions to various benefit events 
and participation in epuration proceedings against 
collaborationist artists. 7S His celebrity reached new 
heights, and the "parti aux 75,000 fusilles," as the 
Communist Party became known in reference to its 
Resistance losses, had scored a strategic coup. 7 " 

Not surprisingly, truly objective discussion of the 
pros and cons of Picasso's wartime production had 
little chance in this heated atmosphere, and critical 
debate tended to polarize around two opposite 
positions: fawning acceptance by political sympa- 
thizers and vehement rejection by aesthetic conser- 
vatives or, worse, those who saw Picasso and his 
art as antithetical to the purity of true French tradi- 
tions, so important, thcv would say, to uphold and 
promote at this time of national reinvigoration.*" 
Various vehicles arose, however, to spread the 
news of his new work internationally. Stories about 
Picasso at the Salon d'Automne, such as that by 
G. H. Archambault that appeared in the New York 
Times Magazine on '29 October, often carried illus- 
trations of recent production." 1 The courageous and 
resourceful Christian Zervos was able to publish by 
the end of 1!&gt; 1 I the latest edition of Cahiers d'Art 
(vols. 15-19, 1940-44), celebrating the work artists 
had done during the war, with special emphasis on 



Picasso. An exhibition of Peintures recentes, accom 
panied by a major catalogue, took place at the 
Galerie Louis Carre in June 19 1~&gt;, and an impoi 
tant exhibition pairing recent paintings b\ Picasso 

with work l&gt;\ Matisse opened at the Victoria and 
Albert Museum in London in December 1945. 

The storm of controversy that this latter show 
provoked in London, where protagonists were far 
removed from the political agendas surrounding 
Picasso in Paris, illustrates just how troubling the 
grim, raw nature of Picasso's wartime work could 
be. In one characteristic attack on the exhibition, 
the critic Michael Ayrton wrote: 

His pictures are now uniformly dung-coloured. . . . 
Picasso has in fact ceased to practice oil painting as 
a craft, and any other medium would have done as 
well for these pictures. . . . He is now engaged upon 
the intellectual activity of flogging his own cliches to 
death with one dirty brush. 

Other critics rushed to Picasso's defense." In the 
exhibition catalogue, a thoughtful assessment of 
the work bv Zervos set it clearly into context: 

J J 

It is because he had the power to compel himself to 
reduce his awareness of the absolute to a temporal 
plane that Picasso, through the events and struggles of 
this time, has been conscious of so many of our great- 
est problems. . . . [H]e represents humanity, glutted 
with murder, with hatred, chaos and affliction every- 
where. All is calamity, beyond control or under- 
standing. . . . His aim above all is to convey the 
mighty righteous anger of one who . . . refuses to bow 
to those forces which threaten it." 1 

Powerful, uncompromising, and unremitting 
these are qualities in Picasso's wartime work that 
stand out, still todav, and that finally override 
any biographical or political considerations to 

constitute 1 his true legacy. 

THEMES OF THE ARTIST: 1940-44 
After Picasso returned to Paris from Royan in 
August 1940, his productivit) declined For several 
months, and he seems to have produced little or 



STEVEN A. NASII •'&gt; 




nothing in the way of paintings, drawings, and 
sculpture until early in 1941. In what may have 
been his first work after this readjustment to life 
in Paris, he painted on 25 January 1941 a small 
gouache on board of a reclining nude (fig. 15). 85 
Although Picasso did not develop the composition 
any further at the time, it is a milestone study, for 
it anticipates directly his famous L'Aubade and 
Reclining Nude, both from 1942, as well as other 
works in an important, extended series of reclining 
nudes (see figs. 16-17 and cat. nos. 51, 53 recto, 75). 

The theme of the reclining nude weaves through 
Picasso's wartime art with several permutations 
and interpretive twists. As in L'Aubade, the nude is 
sometimes accompanied by a musician. At other 
times, as with the Reclining Nude of 1942, she is 
asleep, and sometimes the sleeper is accompanied 
by a companion, male or female, who watches and 
waits. Another variation is the combination of the 
nude with a figure who is washing, a theme with its 
own extended life in the wartime oeuvre. 

These nudes vary considerably in stylistic han- 
dling and formal associations. In Reclining Nude and 
Woman Washing Her Feet (cat. no. 75), the elongated, 
twisting figure is rendered in a particularly linear, 
ideographic manner. In both L'Aubade and Reclining 
Nude, Picasso must have had in the back of his 
mind the pose of Goya's Nude Maja. L'Aubade, 
however, also relates to Ingres's Odalisque with 
a Slave from 1839-40 (fig. 18) and carries over

from that source a hint of rich color and luxurious 
fabric that survives despite the harsh emendations 
to which Picasso subjected his composition. 
The modeling of the nude in L'Aubade is highly 
planar, resembling the buildup of form in Picasso's 
later metal cutouts. In the Reclining Nude, by 
contrast, the modeling has a painterly, solidly 
three-dimensional quality that contributes much 
to the figure's powerful presence. 

These works have in common a somber air of 
loneliness. The architectural surroundings are 
always bleak and confining. Picasso's palette is 
usually stripped down to a sensually deprived 
range of browns, grays, and ochers, and his dim 
illumination casts a nighttime, wintry chill over the 
pictures. Picasso told Heller and others that he pre- 
ferred to work at night, and that for the paintings 
to be understood, they should be seen at night. Sh 

No work better exemplifies the mood of bleak 
subsistence that this cold nighttime light can

first of many powerful still lifes that Picasso pro- 
duced in occupied Paris. s In a typically cubist 
still-life space, with objects and table top tipped 
steeply up toward the picture surface and the 
geometry of walls, table, and curtain providing a 
shifting field of planes, Picasso laid out under a 
hanging lamp a stark array of provisions. But this 
is more than just a simple wartime meal. The 
centralization of the table under an overhead light 
gives the composition a definite altarlike quality, 
with a suggestion of traditional formulas for divine 
light from above, as seen in so many seventeenth- 
century religious paintings. The dramatic juxtaposi- 
tion of the truncated, intestinelike sausage with a 
large knife strongly invokes a sacrificial slaving, 
perhaps a reference to Christ's death on the cross. 
The bottle might contain sacramental wine or, 
alternatively, the vinegar that was fed to Christ in a 
sponge as he hung dying. Out of the open drawer, 
which can be read in this context as in the shape of 
a coffin or tomb, arises a batch of knives and forks, 
referred to by Picasso at one point as souls in 
Purgatory and positioned to resemble small figures 
gesticulating upward in Last Judgment scenes.

either case, it extends far beyond straightforward 
reportage into realms of personal revelation 
involving the artist's psychic file or thoughts of 
despair and salvation. 

Throughout the wartime period the still life 
remained a key vehicle of expression for Picasso. 
Sometimes the works are small, not particularly 
ambitious exercises that might have afforded him a

brief pleasure through the manipulation of a piece 
of brightly colored fruit or the outlining of a jaunty 
pitcher. A well-known series of paintings of tomato 
plants from August 1944 provides an unusually 
upbeat note through the abundant patterning of 
green vines dotted with balls of red, and also 
reveals a domestic side of Picasso's life, in that 
tomato plants were commonly grown in window 
boxes in wartime Paris for a supply of food. 88 

Most often, however, Picasso's still-life composi- 
tions were essentially meditations on life and death 
The magisterial Still Life with Steer's Skull and Table 
from 6 April 1942 (cat. no. 55), for 
example, painted with a companion 
still life to commemorate the recent 
death of his close friend Julio 
Gonzalez, continued the develop- 
ment of his Royan-period memento 
mori pictures by bringing the 
viewer close to the gruesome skull 
of an animal whose death spasms 
are palpable in the agonized set of 
its jaw and strangely fanned teeth. 
Numerous works (e.g., cat. nos. 54, 
71, 79, 80, 81, 83) use a human skull 
in the same role. The one from 14 
March 1945 (cat. no. 80) sets the 
cold white surface of the death 
head against the organic vitality of 
green leeks, explained by Picasso 
to be a substitution for crossed 
bones. 8 ' The bulbous shape of the 
skull, with its huge and empty eye 
socket, reminds us of Picasso's 
bronze Death's Head from 1941, one 
of his most gripping wartime sculp- 
tures (cat. no. 54). The lightened 
palette of the painting, however, 
particularly the stripe of yellow 
sunlight that grazes the skull, con- 
trasts with the morosity of many 
earlier works and may indicate 
the distinctly different emotional 
temperature that early in 1945 
anticipated the end of the war. 

The one theme from these years 



that outweighs in importance and repetition even 
Picasso's still lifes is that of the Seated Woman. 
This motif defines more than any other the inten- 
sity of work from the war years. Beginning, as we 
have seen, in the Royan period and continuing 
throughout his time in occupied Paris, Picasso 
returned to the compositional idea of the Seated 
Woman again and again, wringing from it varied 
expressive effects and psychological nuances. For 
Picasso the theme developed into a kind of looking 
glass that reflected his own internal reactions to 
people and events around him, whether it be 




32 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



happiness with a lover or anguish and fear about 
the war. From his "portraits" of others, an extensive 
self-portrait of the artist emerged. 

Attempts are often made to label these works 
with specific identifications, and Dora Maar is the 
person generally named (see figs. 19-20). The) 
most often are, in fact, paintings of "woman" in 
general. Picasso's smaller bustlength representa- 
tions also fit into this category. The most common 
motif, however, is a halflength figure seated in a 
chair, reminiscent in format of so many portraits 
of seated popes and cardinals from past centuries. 
Although amply represented in Picasso's earlier 
work, the motif took on special meaning for the 
artist during the war, seemingly because it was a 
reliable template of psychological investigation. 
That Picasso told Andre Malraux, "When I 
paint a woman in an armchair, the armchair 
implies old age or death, right?""' must be seen 
as another of his purposefully elliptical apho- 
risms. Indeed, the range of emotion portrayed in 
these expressive women runs from humor and 
joy to utter abjection. 

In the former category is the sparkling Woman 
Seated in an Armchair of 12 October 1941 (cat. no. 
4b). Even though painted during the darkest hours 
of the war, this work, through its brightly colored 
patterns, seems to ringingly affirm life. The compo- 
sition dazzles with its juxtapositions of hot tones - 
from purple/green combinations to flamelike 
oranges — and a dynamic play of flattened shapes 
and energetic line. The sparkling stars in the wall- 
paper strike a note echoed throughout the rest of 
the densely packed, painterly surface. The only 
ominous element is the nail-like eyebrows that 
seem literally to pin one eye and one side of the 
face to the background. 

The Portrait of Dora Maar horn 9 October 1942, 
supposedly painted over a drawing by Cocteau and 
well known for the striped blouse that Picasso "made 
up,"'" shows the extreme range of modes that applies 
in these paintings. Modeled with a degree of natural 
ism Picasso generally reserved during these years for 
women particularly dear to him such as his daughter 
Maya and Nusch Eluard, Dora stares outward with 
a wide-eyed look of resignation. The simplified,

clearly defined planes of the figure and her 
columnar form give her a sculptural quality not 
far removed from the Woman in a Long Dress of 
1943 (cat. no. 73), fashioned by Picasso out of a 
dressmaker's dummy with a head modeled in clay 
and an arm from a tribal sculpture. 

The figure in Woman in a Hal Seated in an 
Armchair of 23 April 1942 (cat no. 56), with her 
jaunty hat, dazed expression, and flattened disloca- 
tions of head and torso, has a somewhat comical 
air, while the Bust of a Woman of 15 October 1941 
and Woman in Gray (Paris), of (&gt; August 1942 (cat. 
nos. 17, 60), employ similar but more extreme dislo 
cations and simplifications in the creation of images 
of women unforgivingly monstrous. Proboscis like

gripped by dark, angular hats and rigid blocks of 
hair. Bust of a Woman appeared just three days after 
the brightly painted Woman Seated in an Armchair 
from Diisseldorf but represents a drastic shift of 
emotion from the gay and playful to dark terror. 

One of the most famous of these seated figures, 
the Woman with an Artichoke horn 1942 (see fig. 21, 
cat. no. 61), echoes similar notes of distress. On the 
one hand, she has all the regal bearing of Ingres's 
Mme Moitessier or his Napoleon seated on his throne 
with raised scepter. '" She could also be taken for 
Picasso's housekeeper Ines, sitting with a long- 
stemmed artichoke meant for dinner. The overall, 
inescapable impression of the image, however, is 
threatening power. The monumental scale of the 
figure is daunting. The sharp fingers on one hand 
are like claws or an armored glove, and the arti- 
choke has more the look of a club or a German 
hand grenade. Picasso's palette of dark greens, 
grays, and browns reinforces the lugubrious mood. 

The force behind all these works is the twisting, 
distorting, deconstructing experience of war. Out 
of the depths of despair, however, Picasso was able 
to extract reasons for hope. Beginning with the 
monumental Man with a Lamb of spring 1943 (cat. 
no. 66), we can find clear if not consistent signs of 
optimism. Two recent developments in the Allied 
counteroffensive against Germany — the invasion 
of North Africa in October 1942 and the surrender 
of the German Sixth Army in Russia after the Battle 
of Stalingrad - signaled a decisive change in the 
fortunes of war. Such events were reported to the 
French population not by Vichy newspapers but 
by clandestine papers and the BBC, and Picasso 
would have been aware of them. 

Picasso made his first known studies for the 
Man with a Lamb on 15 July 1942, conflating two 
figures in the classical scene of tribute-bearing in 
his print Paris, 14 July 1942 (cat. nos. 57, 58), 
which in turn seems to be based on a photograph 
of a gathering of his family in Spain." Over the 
next year, he developed his ideas for the sculp- 
ture through more than fifty drawings examining 
details of the man, the lamb, or the compositional 
ensemble. The last drawings are inscribed March 
1943, and although Picasso later told Brassai that

he modeled the sculpture in February, it must 
date from March or soon thereafter.'' 4 

Over the course of development, Picasso 
changed his conception of the image from that of 
a young man rather protectively holding a playful 
lamb to an older man who, standing rigidly 
upright, grasps and holds out before him a trussed 
animal straining its head upward. Although Picasso 
cautioned about the final sculpture that "there's 
nothing religious about it at all. . . . There's no 
symbolism in it," and that what he was after was 
"a human feeling, a feeling that exists now as it 
has always existed,"'' much discussion has centered 
on possible ancient and Christian sources for the 



34 PICASSO, WAR, AND ART 



sculpture and alternative interpretations. '"' In the 
composition's final form, it is hard to tell if the 
lamb is being saved (with connotations of Christ 
and the Good Shepherd) or is about to be sacrifi- 
cially slaughtered, as the goat in his earlier drawing 
(cat. no. 17) had been so ferociously put to death. 
The fixed expression on the man's face and his 
tight grip, with huge hands, on the braying, strain- 
ing lamb suggest the latter. Picasso's "human feel- 
ing," however, may come not so much from the 
man's care of the lamb as from the transcending 
notion of dedication, as in the ancient story of 
Abraham and Isaac, and the willingness to make a 
sacrifice for the greater common good. This mes- 
sage in 1943 would have been powerful and hope- 
ful, and it is little wonder that Picasso kept the Man 
with a Lamb in the center of his studio for the rest 
of the war and often posed with it, as a centerpiece 
of his wartime art, with postwar visitors (see fig. 14). 

Another optimistic signal is found in the large 
painting entitled First Steps from 21 May 1943 (cat. 
no. 67). A wobbly but determined child is being 
helped to take its first steps by a protective mother. 
Easy sentiment was not a common ingredient in 
Picasso's wartime work, and here, the strongly 
architectural quality of his composition, with the 
mother forming a compact arch over the angular 
structure of the child, overrides the sweetness of 
theme. In essence, Picasso stresses not only the 
innocence of youth but also the hopeful future of a 
younger generation as it thrives and carries forward. 

Even the architectural studies Picasso made of 
familiar sites and monuments in the immediate 
environs of Paris strike a sanguine note. These 
date from mid- 1943 onward. Although generally 
dark and claustrophobically patterned, they 
concentrate on well-known structures - bridges, 
Notre Dame, the Vert-Galant - and seem to 
celebrate the beauty and lasting humanistic quality 
of this built environment. ' 7 

Mention has already been made of the work 
Picasso produced during the street fighting prior to 
the Liberation of Paris, an event that brought much 
closer the conclusion of the war and signaled the 
end of the personal hell that Picasso and his fellow 
Parisians had endured. His variation on Poussin's 



Triumph of Pan (figs. 22-23) is perhaps an allusion 
to the frenzy of street fighting but most basically 
seems an expression of ecstatic joy, a vicarious 
release of emotion unhampered by moderating 
reason. It is a bacchanalia of the spirit. After the 
painful distortions found in his earlier Seated 
Women, Picasso's figures are whole again, albeit 
stretched and twisted in rubbery configurations 
that now are emblems of glee rather than debilita- 
tion. Cognizant of the healing role that art could 
play after so devastating a societal disaster, and 
the need for a restoration of order, Picasso spoke of 
the importance at this time of an art of discipline. 
"Very likely," Picasso said, "for the poet it is a time 
to write sonnets."'* The war, of course, was far 
from over, and during the months ahead he contin- 
ued to produce admonitory memento mori and 
other stark reminders of political reality. Indeed, 
some of his darkest and most troubling pictures 
followed VE Day, during the difficult period of 
European reconstruction. 

Nevertheless, hostilities were near an end by the 
close of 1944. Early in 1945, Picasso began work 
on a painting that stands as a counterpart to the 
Guernica of 1937, commemorating the conclusion 
of the war years just as that earlier masterpiece 
had marked their beginning. His Chamel House 
(cat. no. 82), worked on over the course of many 
months, together with his Monument to the Spanish 
Who Died for France (Monument aux Espagnols 
morts pour la France) (cat. no. 83) from 1945-47, 
both attempted to conclude this painful period by 
memorializing victims, including the many on the 
Spanish side who had given their lives with little 
or no recognition. In one combined, powerful 
statement, Picasso exhibited both paintings at the 
Communist-organized exhibition Art et resistance in 
February 1946, where they spoke propagandisti- 
cally of mourning, retribution, and the harsh 
treatment Spanish Republicans had received at 
the hands of the French government."' 

The Chamel House has more in common with 
Guernica than just iconography, and Picasso may 
have thought of the two pictures as pendants that 
together would stand as bracketing statements 
around the wartime period. It is one of the largest 



STKVKN A. NASH 35 




paintings Picasso undertook for ten years or so 
after Guernica. As with the earlier work, Picasso 
restricted himself to a highly restrained palette of 
grays, black, and white, applied within a linear 
structure of segmented details that adds a staccato 
rhythm to the light-dark contrasts. This black-and- 
white construction may express in part Picasso's 
debt to the graphic art of Goya, where he had 
found a similar image of mass carnage,""' or may 
also reflect the influence of black-and-white films 
or photography. Dora Maar claimed that the idea 
for the painting came from a feature film they had 
seen together."" More convincing is the assertion, 
first made by Picasso himself, although later ques- 
tioned by various authors, that inspiration for the 
painting came from revelations of the atrocities of 
the German concentration camps. Reports of the 
camps and other charniers had begun to spread 



even before the end of 1944, sometimes with the 
inclusion of photographs of victims." 12 Even a 
population whose sensitivities were numbed by 
five years of war was deeply upset by such news. 

Part of Picasso's success in producing so strong 
a brooding effect in this picture is owed to a factor 
that in the past has been considered a fault, the 
canvas's non-finito condition. Picasso worked on 
the composition intermittently over a long period 
of time, and Zervos photographed several different 
states. "" Whether he reached an impasse he could 
not or did not wish to resolve, or whether he 
considered the composition duly complete, we 
do not know. Obviously Picasso considered it 
"finished" enough to sign it and release it for 
exhibition and sale." M 

In its final state, in which underlayers of drawing 
and pentimentiare clearly visible and major segments

ground, and the flames to the right - a ghostly, 
transparent, insubstantial aspect to the picture cre- 
ates a trancelike level of consciousness part way 
between reality and dream."' Picasso liked to 
say that a successful work of art is never really 
finished."" The Charnel House may be a purposeful 
embodiment of this dictum. At any rate, it consum- 
mates in highly moving form the humanistic mes- 
sage of concern for the human race that animates 
so much of Picasso's wartime work. William Rubin 
has called it a requiem." Like the Guernica, it is a 
timeless monument that has lost none of its power 
over the past fifty years and stands now as it did at 
the end of World War II, as a moving indictment 
of man's brutality to man. 

Both the Charnel House and Monument to the 
Spanish Who Died for France satisfy Picasso's pre- 
scription for an art that could serve as a forceful 
"instrument ol war against the enemy." Both, 
however, arc far more rhetorical than most ol his 
work from the war years, speaking in a declamatory 



voice through visual codes that are freighted with

Herbert Read's insightful remarks about Guernica 
in l!)rSH are even more presciently applicable to the 
art of the following seven years: 

[Picasso's] symbols are banal, like the symbols 
of Homer, Dante, Cervantes. For it is only when 
the widest commonplace is infused with the intensest 
passion that a great work of art, transcending 
all schools and categories, is born; and being bom, 
lives immortally. 

Like Van Gogh's potatoes and boots, expressive 
symbols that Picasso openly admired, his quotid 
ian, nondescript subjects speak loudly. His blood 
sausages, artichokes, and leeks, sheep skulls 
intended ultimately for the dog's dinner, casseroles 
and candles, and anonymous Lonely women may 
not actually scream the truth of the war, but they 
hit their marks of meaning with uncorrupted.

Picasso's Disasters of War: 
The Art of Blasphemy 



Robert Rosenblum 



O. 



f the masterpieces at the Prado, 
in whose Spanish ancestral company 
Picasso hoped Guernica (fig. 1) would eventually 
be displayed for posterity,' none was more relevant 
than Goya's Third of May, 1808 (fig. 2), which, 
although painted six years after the event, still 
gives the illusion of eye-witness immediacy. Its 
journalistic title might well have been updated by 
Picasso to the Twenty- Sixth of April, 1937 m order to 
pinpoint the historical reality of the Nazi saturation 
bombing of helpless civilians as they went about 
their business at the end of a Monday market day 
in the ancient Basque capital." Apart from its obvi- 
ous precedence as a pictorial response to a Spanish 
national tragedy that involved brutal conflicts not 
only between foreign and native powers, but also 
between opposing internal factions, Goya's Third 
of May, 1808 also launches on the epic scale of 
history painting a grim and modern vision of 
contemporary humanity that, as if in response to 
a pervasive evil, bitterly parodies Catholic tradi- 
tions of imager)' and morality. 

Expanding upon many of the gruesome 
vignettes Goya recorded in a series of etchings, the" 
Disasters of War, the Third of May shrilly proclaims 
an era dominated bv the anti-Christ The central. 



white-shirted martyr, only one among the endless 
belt-line of victims, is a mock version of the Cruci- 
fixion; his extended palms even display ironical lv 
the blood stains of the stigmata, just as his posture 
of Christian martyrdom is shockingly repeated in 
the totally lifeless, bloody corpse that lies, face 
down, below him. Among those about to die is 
another figure who would outrage Catholic pieties, 
a tonsured monk who, kneeling, clutches his hands 
in a prayer that will go unheeded. The malevolent 
night sky offers no source of light and, below it, 
the unidentified monastery with a church tower 
(which recalls the sacred buildings that dominated 
the silhouette of Fuendetodos, Goya's birthplace 
looks like an archaeological relic from a civiliza- 
tion forever extinguished by the human slaughter 
in the foreground. Replacing the natural light of 
the sky, a lantern used by the Napoleonic troops 
targets the captured guerrillas and permits a 
glimpse of the carnage with photoflash clarity. The 
widening beam of light from the yellow and -white 
lantern, whose colors are echoed in the vellow- 
and-white clothing of the central victim, almost 
becomes a surrogate agent of death. While 
discussing Guernica with Andre Malraux, Picasso 
himself brought up Genu's painting and stated

quite clearly, "The lantern is Death." 1 

In the Third of May, Christian motifs, poignantly 
warped by these new realities, are constantly 
recalled; and as in many of the Disasters of War, 
they evoke the traditional depictions of human suf- 
fering that finally lead to redemption. Christ on the 
Mount of Olives, which Goya in fact would paint 
in a legible Christian guise some five years later in 
1819, giving it to the fathers at the Escuelas Pias in 
Madrid, is one such theme echoed by the Third of 
May as well as by the first plate, Sad Forebodings of 
Things to Come, of the Disasters of War, whose most 
shocking scenes of torture, dismemberment, and 
corpse-bearing can be viewed as new, godless 
mutations of standard Christian iconography. As 
a young artist, Goya, like the young Picasso, 
depicted a familiar religious repertory, including 
the Burial and the Lamentation of Christ (fig. 3), 
not to mention the Crucifixion itself. ' These motifs 
are often present in the Disasters, as in the case of 
the mother carried off to her grave while her lone 
child, weeping, blindly follows the corpse (no. 50,

Unhappy Mother, fig. 4), or when two uniformed 
brutes lug a male corpse to the cemetery (no. 56, 
To the Cemetery). And the most barbaric mutilations 
depicted (no. 33, WJiat More Could One Do?) can 
be seen in the venerable context of saints' martyr- 
doms, so that the X-shaped, upside-down, dragged, 
or trussed bodies of the anonymous victims 
become hideous secular variants on the familiar 
abundance of uncommon suffering endured for 
their faith by such saints as Andrew, Peter, and 
Bartholomew, whose agonies were so often empha- 
sized with close-up realism in the traditions of 
Spanish Catholic art. 

Of the countless ways to interpret Guernica and 
its progeny, Goya's bitter inversions of Catholic 
imagery and morality offer some major points of 
departure. His relevance to Picasso must have 
been reaffirmed in 1935, when the Bibliotheque 
Nationale held a large exhibition from the Prado of 
Goya's prints (including the complete Disasters of

War), drawings, tapestries, and a few paintings.' 
Like his old-master compatriot, Picasso, too, was 
heir to the rituals and iconography of the church 
and, even as a teenager in Spain, rendered in an 
often sketchy, Goyesque manner a wide repertory 
of Christian themes, from the Crucifixion and 
the Annunciation to the Holy Family and Saint 
Anthony of Padua. But following as well a tradition 
of anti-Catholic parody particularly vital in the 
most pious Catholic nations, Picasso, from his 
childhood on, would often make irreverent jokes 
on these conventional pieties. Already in WJ.i, the 
year of his fourteenth birthday, he made a rapid 
drawing of Christ blessing, of all unlikely people, 
the Devil (and with his left hand, to boot) (fig. 5);' 
and before the turn of the century he would make 
cartoonlike spoofs on the popular imagery of ex- 
votos, offering, for example, in a willfully crude, 
folkloric style the ludicrous religious reflex of a 
desperate prayer to an apparition of the Virgin in 
heaven on the occasion of a very modern auto- 
mobile accident (fig. 6). 8 

Such minor and youthful demonstrations of the 
sinful fun of Catholic blasphemy reached almost 
transcendental proportions in Les Demoiselles d 'Avi- 
gnon (fig. 7), in which the central whore, seemingly 
afloat on a crescent of melon that rises from the 
tumbling still life below, is virtually an illustration

of the phrase later used to describe the painting, 
"The Apocalyptic Whorehouse.'"' For a Spaniard in 
particular, this airborne image becomes a shocking 
paraphrase of one of the most familiar themes in 
Spanish Catholic art, the Virgin borne to heaven on 
a crescent moon." 1 Of the countless international and 
Spanish examples of this motif, one must have been 
of particular relevance to Picasso, El Greco's 
Assumption of the Virgin of 1577 (fig. 8). Before leav- 
ing for the Art Institute of Chicago in 1906, it had 
made its way to Paris in 1904, where, for two years, 
it resided at the mecca of modern art, the Galerie 
Durand-Ruel, frequented by Picasso and every 
other aspiring artist." With one brilliant, heretical 
twist, Picasso has wedded his national tradition of 
visionary Catholicism, exemplified by El Greco, 
the newly resurrected ancestral hero of Spanish 
modern art, to a brothel scene. Among other 
things, he thereby fused the fin-de-siecle concept of 



woman as virgin or femme fatale, 12 and recalled as 
well the old quip about the male Spaniard's typical 
Sunday: mass in the morning, bullfight in the after- 
noon, and brothel in the evening. 

Such a double-entendre may still be understood 
in the context of the popular humor of Catholic 
countries that turns nuns into whores and priests 
into money-grabbing drunkards. But thirty 
years later, in Guernica, Picasso's heretical use of 
Catholic iconography took on a new and tragic 
pervasiveness whose sense of total malevolence 
matched not only its prototypes in Goya, but also 
the historical events on the eve of World War II. 
Christian faith has become futile, challenged 
already at the top of the painting in the sinister 
source of artificial light that offers the work's only 
reference to a uniquely twentieth-century reality.

Velazquez's Coronation of the Virgin by the Trinity 
( 1041-42) all turn our terrestrial eyes upward to 
a celestial sun and bird. In Guernica, that sun and 
bird have been destroyed. The unnatural light 
source, which can be read as pilot's eye, bomb, 
and flashbulb, becomes both the cause of the

havoc below as well as the photographic means of 
recording and disseminating it through the press, 
much as the light from the groundborne lantern in 
Goya's Third of May seems both the agent of death 
and the objective way of disclosing these unspeak- 
able facts for posterity. 

As for the bird, it falls in the throes of death not 
only from its natural element, the sky, but also 
from its supernatural Catholic symbol of a radiant 
blaze of light. It may also be a bleak inversion of 
the message of the colomba, the dove in the upper 
left-hand corner of a manuscript page illustrating 
the Deluge in the Spanish Romanesque Apocalypse of 
Saint Sever (fig. 11)." This bird, high on the branch 
of an olive tree against an intensely yellow sky, 
signifies the coming of peace to the human and 
animal victims of cosmic disorder below. Picasso 
knew well these visionary images from medieval 
Spain and, as often pointed out, used their flat styl- 
izations and colors, as did Mho, for inspiration, not 
only in his Crucifixion of 1930 but in the treatment 



of Guernica's fallen warrior. Guernica's bird, too, is 
marked for sacrifice, its open beak rhyming with 
the screaming mouth of the mother at the left, just 
before the moment it lands on a tabletop. 1, Picasso 
already had explored similar bird-and-table motifs, 
perhaps even recalling ironically his painter-father 
Jose Ruiz Blasco's kitsch specialty, the painting of 
pigeons in states of almost human happiness and 
domesticity."' As early as 1912, working in a cubist 
mode, Picasso painted two dead birds - their wings 
spread, their stiff feet turned up - lying on a table- 
top that is given a triptychlike structure (fig. 12). 
The upstretched claws of one of the birds reach 
toward the fragmented cubist letters CHR, which 
inevitably suggest the word CHRIST. There is 
something strangely sacramental about this feath- 
ered offering, as if the birds were placed on an 
altar. 1 ' It was a theme, in fact, that would recur with 
many variations in Picasso's work before Guernica,

46 PICASSO'S DISASTERS OF WAR 



especially in 1919-21, when a variety of birds - 
pigeon, dove, rooster — lie dead or about to 
be slaughtered on a table. But Guernica's bird, 
falling from the sky or from its Catholic place 
ment as the Holy Spirit within a reigning, 
golden luminosity, announces new dimensions 
of cosmic upheaval. 

It is telling that, during the years of the Napo- 
leonic invasion of Spain, from 1H0S to IS 11, Goya 
himself painted a series of grisly animal still lifes 
that included paintings of dead birds - chickens, 
turkeys, ducks, woodcocks (fig. 13) - brutally 
plucked, strung up, or trussed like barbaric sac i i 
fices on kitchen counters, the feathered surrogates 
of the human corpses he was recording at the 
same time. 1 * The triumph of human savagery 
seems, in these still lifes, to extend even to the 
domain of butchers and cooks, contaminating 
the sensuous appeal of earlier kitchen still-life 
traditions with real blood, pain, and indignities. 
Already in 1921, Picasso painted a ferocious black 
dog menacing a bound and helpless rooster in an 
image so close to violent death that it can hardly 
be called a "still life." 1 " And only months after 
Guernica, on 15 February 1938, Picasso pushed 
this barbarism further in a painting of a demonic 
woman who, like a priestess of Santena, squats 
on the floor beside a knife, as with one hand she 
clutches the wings of a trussed, desperate rooster 
and with the other a cup for the blood (see page 
1!), fig. 3). It is an animal sacrifice made still more 
demonic in a drawing of the same year that 
depicts a frenzied woman plunging a knife into 
the throat of a trussed goat, as the blood drips 
into a bowl on the floor (cat. no. 17). 

Guernica's evil inversions of both natural and 
supernatural law and order reach a sacrilegious 
extreme at the lower left of the painting, where the 
dead child is held by the screaming mother, whose 
open mouth, like the bird's, is directed to a now 
extinct heaven. Here, Picasso creates a heartrend- 
ing parody of one of the most familiar of all 
Catholic images of suffering and redemption, the 
Pieta. Predictably, this, too, has a specifically Span 
ish inflection, not only in its extremities of physical 
and psychological pain, but more particularly in its

allusion to one of the most familiar images in Span- 
ish art, the Virgen de las Dolores or the Virgen de 
las Angustias (the Virgin of Sorrows or Anguish), 
as often recreated in Spanish baroque polychrome 
sculpture and in popular religious art throughout 
the Hispanic world. The tongue of Guernica s griev- 
ing mother is shaped like sharp, pointed metal, a 
metaphor for a sword (like the one that pierces the 
flank of the neighboring horse) and an allusion to 
the piercing metal that intensifies so many Spanish 
depictions of the Virgin, who, as in Gregorio 
Fernandez's Virgin of Sorrows, plunges a sword into 
her own heart, her radiant halo a painful crown of 
metallic thorns (fig. 14). 

This excruciating image of metal cutting into 
flesh can be found not only in many of the prelimi- 
nary studies for Guernica, but also in the series of 
weeping women that followed it. 20 In one prepara- 
tory study of 28 May 1937 (cat. no. 6), a mother 
rushes from a burning building, her sharply pointed 
tongue directed straight up to the malevolent heav- 
ens as she holds a dying child whose chest, along 
with the mother's protective right hand, seems to 
have been pierced by a broken sword hurled, like 
one of Jupiter's thunderbolts, from a stormy sky. 21 
Could this be a memory, too, of the centurion's 
lance that leaves the mark of the fatal wound on 
Christ's side? And in this drawing, the screaming 
mother's hair is exactly that, a tumble of real 
human hair fixed to the paper, a startling new form 
of collage as well as a survival of the Spanish tradi- 
tion of including common realities — clothing, 
blood, hair — in sculptural depictions of Christian 
themes, whether in the most exalted shrines or in 
the pasos, the popular, lifesize processional figures 
wheeled through the streets during Holy Week. 
And in the same spirit of mixing tangible facts and 
pictorial fictions, Picasso, during the evolution of 
Guernica, added patches of patterned wallpaper as 
dresses for three of the painting's four women, as 
well as affixing, according to an unforgettable 
account by Roland Penrose, a strip of toilet paper 
to the kneeling woman's exposed buttocks." 

As is so often the case with Picasso, such tech- 
niques and images often recall the artist's child- 
hood memories. Of surprising relevance here is the

fact that Picasso's father had once created his own 
Virgin of Sorrows from a bust of Venus acquired at 
a flea market. By covering the pagan head with a 
plaster-dipped cloth, adorning it with a metal halo 
and a garland of flowers, as well as adding fake 
tears and painted eyebrows to the face, he trans- 
formed the sculpture into a Spanish religious icon. 
When, in 1954, Rosamond Bernier went to Barce- 
lona to gather material on early Picasso for the 
magazine L'Oeil, she visited the Picasso family's 
apartment and photographed many of its contents, 
including the corner shelf upon which this conver- 
sion of an antique deity to Catholicism still resided 
like a holy image. On seeing the photo, Picasso 
commented that he had always loved this odd 
work, that it was a "collage avant la lettre."" 

The motif of the Virgin of Sorrows is one that 
casts its painful shadow across many of the draw- 
ings, prints, and paintings of convulsively sobbing 
women that Picasso continued to make during the 
aftershock of Guernica. More specifically, many of 
them appear to have as the physical source of pain 
long, pointed darning-needle shapes that, replacing 
their original function as symbols of female handi- 
work, actually pierce the tear ducts, releasing at 
times the kind of comma-shaped tears frequently 
represented in Spanish polychrome sculpture by 
bits of shaped glass. And as often happened with 
Picasso, these implicit allusions to old-master art 
would become ever more explicit in his later work. 
In a lithograph dated 2 March 1959, he actually

made a portrait of his wife-to-be, Jacqueline Roque, 
as the Virgin of Sorrows, her eyes streaming tears 
and her exposed heart pierced by swordlike stems 
of flowers (fig. 15). 

Like Joyce, Picasso had a genius for densely lay- 
ered punning that can take us back through many 
genealogical tables to a variety of archetypes; and 
in the case of Guernica, this genius is so abundant 
that later commentators have been able to find 
cryptic references to everything from Vishnu and 
the Rape of Europa to Pinocchio and Hitler. ' But 
on a more modest level of the kind of speculation 
Picasso's art will always invite, the multiple refer- 
ences to archetypal Christian themes, shown as a 
shocking anthology of sacrilegious inversions, fall 
into clearer focus. The very structure of the paint- 
ing evokes one of the most familiar formats of 
Catholic altarpieces, the triptych. A particularly 



relevant example, Matthias Griinewald's Isenheim 

Altar, which was published in 1936 fo] Cafliers 
d'Artb) Picasso's friend and cataloguer, Christian 
Zervos, had alread) provided constant inspiration 
for the artist in the 1930s, as it did for other mas 
ters of the decade, especiall) in German) Max 
Beckmann and Otto Dix. Dix's triptych with 
predella of 1929 32, War (fig. 16), a gruesome 
memory of death in the trenches, offered a parti&lt; u 
larlv blasphemous reincarnation of his sixteenth 
century compatriot's anguished view of Christian 
suffering and ultimate redemption. 

But there are, of course, other inescapable mem 
ories of Christianit) in Guernica. The dramatis per 
sonae, especially given the actual number of 
women and children who died during the bomb 
ing of the city, evoke the Massacre of the Innocents 
(indeed, the French press could refer to the event 
as the "Massacre du Peuple Basque" ', a theme 
whose memory is also grimly alive in one of Goya's 
Disasters of War [no. 11, Nor Do These). More specif] 
call), both Poussin's and Reni's interpretations of 
the biblical massacre are often cited as sources of 
Guernica:" In addition, the apocalyptic tenor of the 
whole (which may also be discerned, via El Greco, 
in the visionary character of Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon) 
finds a corollary in the familiar motif of Death on a 
Pale Horse. The speared, agonized animal in the 
center of Guernica, beyond its references to the 
bullring, also evokes the ghostly steed from Revela- 
tion who thunders across the earth leaving a trail of 
death and destruction. It was a biblical image of 
the end of the world, now consummated through 
modern warfare, that Picasso's compatriot, Jose 
Gutierrez-Solana (who often exhibited in Pans and 
who moved there in 1937), had ahead) painted in 
1920, 29 probably in the wake of Vicente Blasco 
Ibarie/.'s famous novel of World War I, The Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1916) (fig. 17). And 
Guernica's In use. placed in conjunction with

would here become a satanic parody, since the

would-be convert now looks up with open, 
yet sightless eyes to an evil apparition. 

Providing yet another allusion to Christ- 
ian iconography, at the right-hand side of 
the "triptych," is the split-second image of 
a woman, her dress on fire, falling like a 
living torch from a window, at the same 
moment the bird drops to its death from 
the sky. With her arms stretched to the 
heavens in agony, the woman seems, 
among other things, a chillingly apt quota- 
tion from the Disasters of War, whether as 
the pair of hands reaching up from the 
chaos of a crowd escaping through flames 
(no. 41, They Escape through the Flames) 3 ' or 
the startling sight of a corpse just as it is hurled into 
a ditch that serves as a communal grave (no. 27, 
Charity, and no. 30, Ravages of War). It is telling that 
Goya is reputed to have said that the essential qual- 
ities of a draftsman lay in the ability to seize the 
five cardinal points of a figure as it falls from a roof 
to the ground," and indeed, he often demonstrated 
this ability to capture the shock of a body falling 
mid-air. Could Picasso have had this in mind 
when, like a journalist at the front with a flash cam- 
era, he captured the minisecond of horror endured 
by the flaming woman before she hits the ground? 

In any case, her posture, with its painfully 
stretched arms and exposed palms, first essayed in 
the drawing of a falling man (27 May 1937; Museo 
Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid), 
evokes a Crucifixion, especially in conjunction 
with the Pieta-like left-hand grouping of this trip- 
tych. And here, as well, Picasso has maligned the 
structure of Christian altarpieces, since either one 
of these themes, the Crucifixion or the Pieta, would 
conventionally be relegated to the larger, middle 
section of a triptych, whereas in Guernica, both are 
peripheral, leaving for the central devotional image 
nothing but the earthbound debris of a new form 
of destruction from the air. As a further irony, the 
woman, who, with bared buttocks and one knee 
dragging, raises her eyes in bewilderment to the 
skies, is not only a parody of Ingres's painting of 
Thetis beseeching Jupiter to help her son Achilles 
in the Trojan Wars below (fig. 18)," but also recalls

the awestruck, kneeling posture of prayer associ- 
ated with Catholic traditions of rural feminine 
piety, an expression of wide-eyed, simpleminded 
faith often recorded by Goya." 

Guernica was hardly the first of Picasso's refer- 
ences to the collision between the realities of the 
twentieth century and the venerable Catholic tradi- 
tions that had nurtured him in Spain, but his earlier 
heresies had been more humorous, sporadic, or 
single-minded in their allusions to Christian rituals 
and symbols. In Guernica, the artist's awareness of 
the impossible disparity between a new kind of 
modern warfare and the ancient faith in heavenly 
redemption through suffering takes on a numbing, 
apocalyptic vastness that resurrects for our own 
century the shock of Goya's Third of May, yielding 
a universal vision of the way these holy images 
from churches and museums had become pitiful 
anachronisms, to be remembered only by mock- 
ery. To be sure, Picasso was never able to repeat 
the epic sweep of Guernica s proclamation of a new 
form of anti-Christian evil, but the aftershocks 
could be felt again and again throughout the war 
years, in both oblique and direct ways. 

Night Fishing at Antibes (cat. no. 31) was com- 
pleted at the end of August 1939, on the eve of 
Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September and 



50 PICASSO'S DISASTERS OF WAR 



the declaration of war. It has been persuasively 
interpreted by Timothy Anglin Burgard ' as a 
painting that, beginning superficially as a Mediter- 
ranean genre scene, reveals a wealth of references 
to the defeat of Republican Spain, to the women in 
Picasso's private life, and to traditions of Christian 
imagery." Absorbed here are such canonic images 
as Raphael's Miraculous Draft of Fishes, such works 
of Spanish medieval art as a scene from the life of 
Saint Vincent that was surely known to Picasso, 
and still more of the apocalyptic imagery of the 
Beatus manuscripts that had so often nourished his 
imagination. These visions might include the spiral- 
ing yellow-orange light at the top of the painting 
that can be read not only as the fishermen's acety- 
lene decoy lamp that substitutes for solar light, but 
also as the apparition of a comet or shooting star 
signaling imminent, airborne calamity. Moreover, 
the two female spectators on the jetty may be 
interpreted as a complementary pair of visionary 
personae. Dora Maar reincarnates the Whore of 
Babylon, lewdly licking her double-scoop ice- 
cream cone with the tongue of her ithyphallic head 
while clutching with her other hand the bicycle's 
handlebar at the appropriate place in her skirt; and 
Jacqueline Lamba, Andre Breton's wife, reincar- 
nates the Woman of the Apocalypse, clothed in the 
sun, the crescent moon at her feet. Opposed to the 
pseudosolar blaze in the heavens above, she seems 
to offer a lunar counterpart to the whore, with a 
crescent-moon profile superimposed on a face 
bathed in milky light. Moreover, the central drama 
of the painting may allude through traditional 
Christian iconography to the sacrifice of Christ. 
The fish (here a sole, whose oddly flattened eyes 
and "face" once prompted Alfred H. Barr to call it 
the "most Picassoid of fishes") M was often read as a 
symbol of Christ and, when pierced by a trident, 
became a symbol of the Crucifixion. 39 In Night Fish- 
ing, the trident, now provided with an extra tine, like 
a table fork about to attack a platter offish, becomes a 
four-pronged spear that is seen at the instant before it 
claims its sacrificial victim. Meanwhile, the ordinal) 
fish at the left has just swum past the diagonal line 
tied to the toe of the other fisherman, who, clumsily 
poised and stupidly staring at the water, offers a foil

to the focused, elegant precision of his companion, 
whose clutched weapon is as unswervingly vertical 
as a plumb line. Does this would-be genre scene, of 
an imposing size that rivals Guernica, evoke a dis- 
torted, wartorn memory of Christian sacrifice in the 
way that, later in 1943, the noble solemnity of the 
bronze Man with a Lamb (cat. no. (&gt;(&gt;) would echo 
back through the Bible to the Sacrifice of Isaac? And 
might the white-and-yellow lamp that, from the prow 
of the boat, casts its beams upon the sole echo the 
lethal lantern in Goya's Third of May? 

Animal sacrifice, the soul of bullfighting and, 
for Picasso, a recurrent memory of both pagan 
and Christian motifs, left its terror, blood, and 
bones on main works from the war years. AlreatK 
in April U)'A9, another bird becomes the victim 
of a new kind of savagery in the two versions oi 
a ferocious cat (22 [cat. no. 30] and 24 {?] April 
[Zervos IX, 25)7]) torturing a fluttering bird whose 
screaming, open beak and helpless legs echo the

desperation of its falling prototype in Guernica. 
On 13 November 1941, Picasso returned to the 
more familiar prewar theme of a bird — in this 
case, a white pigeon — lying on what resembles 
an aerial view of a tabletop whose brilliant reds 
and yellows assert the Spanish national colors (cat. 
no. 48). t0 With its outstretched red legs and claws 
that seem to penetrate the bird's own body like a 
sword, this ironic dove of peace also evokes an air- 
plane through the unexpectedly smooth, metallic 
configuration of the taut upper wing, which con- 
trasts to the feathered contour of the lower wing 
falling toward the earth. 

Of the wartime animal victims, few, if any, are 
more brutalized than the sheep whose heads and 
skulls make up a grisly sequence that, moving from 
sketchbook to paintings, Picasso started in Royan 
on 30 September 1939, at the end of the bleak 
month that began with an official declaration of 
war. Ranging from the shadowy, bone-dry skull of 
a black-and-white india ink drawing (1 October 
1939) (cat. no. 34) to the painting of a flayed head 
whose blood-red tissues seem caught between life 
and death (4 October 1939) (cat. no. 35), these 
butcher's trophies add a new dimension to the 
Spanish tradition of memento mori, painfully 
appropriate to the outbreak of an ever-expanding 
war. In her eloquent and detailed account of this 
series, Jean Sutherland Boggs raised exactly those 
questions pertinent to Guernica's heretical fusion of 
Catholic symbolism and Goya's black vision of 
modern history." Are these slaughtered - in fact, 
decapitated - sheep or lambs to be read as night- 
mare mutations of the Agnus Dei, the lamb of God, 
who might also be resurrected in more hopeful 
terms in the bronze Man with a Lamb?' 2 Indeed, 
Christian iconography offers as many different 
readings of the lamb as does the most multilayered 
of Picasso's own images. It may symbolize not only 
the Crucifixion and the Eucharist, as in Zurbaran's 
starkly shadowed image of a haloed, woolly lamb 
with its four legs bound together for slaughter," but 
also the Resurrection, a redeemed sinner, a faithful 
member of the flock, or, in still more general 
terms, a harmless innocence.matching that of the 
dove of peace (or Holy Spirit) that so often is killed 



and mysteriously reborn in Picasso's art and life, 
even in the name of his second daughter, Paloma. 44 

As with Guernica, Goya's dark shadow also hov- 
ers over these remnants from a butcher's counter. 
Just as he had depicted the humanoid corpses of 
birds during the years of the Napoleonic invasion, 
so, too, did Goya paint an even more gruesome 
still life of a sheep hacked into a dismembered 
head, two rib cages, and the end of a joint, a can- 
vas that, with grimly perfect timing for Picasso, 
was acquired by the Musee du Louvre in 1937. 4 ' 
One of Picasso's variations on this morbid theme, 
6 October 1939 (cat. no. 36), is particularly close to 
Goya in its inclusion of a rib-cage fragment, but the 
head's almost audible scream defies the inertia 
of Goya's sheep's head and resonates back to the 
hysterical noise of Guernica. 

After the screams of war, however, the eerie, 
eternal silence of death must preside, as it finally 
does in human terms in Picasso's graveyard climax 
to these apocalyptic years, the Charnel House (cat. 
no. 82), begun in February 1945, when the end of 
the war was in sight. 41 ' The satanic sky, source of 
the explosive, deathly energy in Guernica, has van- 
ished. The upper zone of the canvas is left incom- 
plete, a linear skeleton of a still life - pitcher and 
casserole on a tabletop - that, by contrast, intensi- 
fies the earthbound density of the human dump 
heap abandoned in the constricted space of a 
kitchen floor. From these corpses, a suggestion of 
ghostly fire rises toward the upper right, a memory 
perhaps of the ovens in the concentration camps, 
also evoked, in a startlingly direct way, in Picasso's 
ready-made sculpture of 1945, the Venus of Gas, a 
gas stove he found that recalls both a prehistoric 
fertility goddess and one of the Nazis' infamous 
new methods of genocide. 47 For such a scene of 
the human garbage of warfare, Picasso, of course, 
could turn to many plates from the Disasters of War 
(especially nos. 18-27) 48 and he may even have had 
in mind, given the domestic setting with its mur- 
dered nuclear family scattered among the now 
equally inanimate furniture, Daumier's famous lith- 
ograph of the slaughter in a bedroom of four mem- 
bers of a Parisian family (mother, father, infant, 
and grandparent) on the rue Transnonain during 



52 PICASSO'S DISASTERS OF WAR 



the workers' uprisings of 14-1") April 1834. But 
these memories of art were also reincarnated for 
Picasso in the present tense of contemporary his- 
tory through the medium of journalistic photogra- 
phy, just as in 15)37 he had turned to news accounts 
of the bombing of Guernica provided by the 
French press. Presumably Picasso saw for the first 
time, in 194"), the realities of the concentration 
camps as revealed through black-and-white pho- 
tographs, although it has recently been suggested 
that it was more likely an earlier photograph of the 
corpses of Soviet victims, reproduced in the 13 
December 1944 issue of LHumanite, that initially 
triggered his imagination when working on the 
Char ml House." But whatever the case, the Charnel 
House, like Guernica, far transcends the particulars 
of modern historical fact. As a tombstonelike 
epilogue to the 1937 mural that appeared to launch 
this universal evil, the Charnel House also turns 
Christianity upside down. The male victim, a 
father, still bears the marks of his torture, his wrists 
bound like the legs of the sacrificial lamb in the 
bronze of 1943. But this binding brutally forces his 
arms to rise high over his floor-bound head, in a 
gross distortion of the Crucifixion, a hideous varia- 
tion on Saint Peter's own inversion of Christ's 
martyrdom. A stream of blood flows from the dead 
mother's breast, as if from Christ's lanced side, 
pointlessly falling onto first one, and then the 
other, of the dead infant's outstretched hands in 
another mockery of the Eucharistic blood of Christ 
received in Holy Communion. 

Perhaps the ultimate blasphemy is the way in 
which Picasso has extracted a skeletal, bone-white 
cruciform pattern from the painful intersection of 
the father's bound forearms. This ghost of a cross, 
rising above the camouflaged chaos of a family of 
corpses, is a shocking reminder in this makeshift 
cemetery of a long-lost world. William Rubin once 
aptly referred to the Charnel House as a requiem. 
But Picasso also tells us that by L945 there is no 
longer any church where a mass for these victims 
can be performed.

Death Falling from the Sky: 
Picasso's Wartime Texts 



Lydia Csatb Gasman 



That (hath amid fall from heaven 
on so many, right in the middlt oj 
rushed life, has always had great 
meaning for me. Picasso, 1967 

The "homhh i xpeeted" 

in Paris at the outset of World 
Wa\ II prompted Picasso's flight 
in Royan &lt;m the mast of the 
Atlantic. -- Brassai, 1966 



Xicasso was not the only one who feared 
bombings from the air. By the mid- 1930s, 
many observant Europeans had succumbed to the 
inordinate fear of an apocalyptic air power. During 
the Spanish Civil War and World War II, Nazi 
flying machines whose destructiveness far sur- 
passed that of the German Zeppelins and "Gotha" 
bombers in World War I seemed to enforce the 
end of Western civilization. Air power was any- 
thing but abstract. The flying Death in the famous 
Triumph of Death at the Camposanto in Pisa' and 
the dropping demons in the naive Temptation oj 
Saint Anthony, reproduced in the winter 1937 issue 
of Minotaure (fig. 1), now became real. Death 
descending from the air was there for all to see, so 
tangible and tragic that it appeared farcical, a stan- 
dard subject for cartoons such as the winged skele- 
ton dispatching bombs in the Republican El Angel 
de la Paz . . . de los Faseistas! (fig. 2) and the winged 
messengers of the gestapo in David Low's AngeLs of 
Peace Descend on Belgium (fig. 3). Picasso wrote that 
his "eyes [were] caught by the sk\"of war.' In his 
poetic thinking, the sinister planes of the encim 
swooping repeatedly, together with the "sky that 
lets itself down" (222)* — brushed against him, 
affecting his psychological makeup, physiological 



functions, and power to create. Diving vertically, 
the "sky [let] its fist fall" (178) on Picasso. His skin, 
he sensed, was badgered by the buzzing bombers 7 / 
"bees . . . of the sky" (210). The "wings of the sky 
. . . shook off their fleas" (215) onto his being. 
Fear of bombs hammering from the sky is 
altogether different from trepidations that daze 
the psyche fallen prey to war pressures. While the 
fear of air raids is rational, B in 1940 Marc Bloch 
witnessed and recorded the "cold fear" inspired by 
air bombing that provokes a far-reaching disorder 
in the nervous system. Its roots, he concluded, 
arc "very deep in human nature" and manifest a 
"peculiarly illogical" dimension of the "instinct for 
self-preservation." Though an attack from the sk) 
is, "probably, in itself, no more' actually dangerous 
than main other kinds of peril to which the sol- 
dier" or the civilian is exposed, no one is "ever 
likelv to forget the experience" of "dive-bombers," 
their dreadful "acoustic qualities," in themselves 
capable of "so work[ing] upon the nerves that the) 
become wrought to a pitch of intolerable tension 
whence it is a very short step to panic." The point

predicament, but also from the knowledge that 
bombs may hit those who are close to you. 
Distance from actual bombing can worsen rather 
than quell anguish; evil imagined can be more 
intolerable than evil endured. Starkly present, it 
flees retaliation. Post-traumatic stress disorder is 
not uncommonly caused by "accounts of death or 
injury (in contrast to direct encounters)." Being 
"'confronted 1 with traumatic events would include 
'learning about unexpected or violent death, seri- 
ous harm, or threat of death or injury'" 1, occurring 
in faraway communities to which the (confronted) 
individual is loyal.

is, Bloch suggests, that the natural assumption of 
heaven as the place of God blends into dread of 
the sky as the space of bombers. Impacted by 
"bombs dropped from a great height," the sublimi- 
nal wager on heavenly goodness breaks down:" 
"The combination of weight and altitude gives 
them an appearance of almost visible violence 
which no shelter, however thick, seems capable of 
resisting. There is something inhuman about the 
nature of the trajectory and the sense of power." ' 2 
Picasso himself was not hit by bombs, but they 
did strike those with whom he identified. It was 
their martyrdom that deep down martyred him, 
regardless of his pragmatic selfishness and healthy 
appetite for living. The fear of air raids he confessed 
to only in his writings was evidently a fear for the 
plight of other human beings. They were the "inter- 
subject, [or] co-subject"" of Picasso's Guernica (see 
pages 40-41, fig. 1), of shattering passages in his 
wartime texts, and of their guarded transpositions 
in concurrent art works. As he himself granted 
some twenty years after the end of World War II, 
"that death could fall from heaven on so many, 
right in the middle of rushed life, has always 
had a great meaning for me."" Science attests that 
air-raid terror arises not only from a personal

AIR POWER AND THE RELIGION OF FEAR 

Shortly before the Spanish Civil War, Picasso's 
friend Andre Malraux became convinced that "the 
next war would primarily be won by air power.""' 
He was acquainted with the Realpolitik behind 
"strategic terror bombing," 17 the military theory 
first formulated by General Giulio Douhet in the 
1920s, 1K which advocated assaults on civilians and 
nonmilitary targets in order to undermine the 
enemy's will and capacity to resist. In Man 's Hope 
(published in 1938), confirming Douhet's principle 
that merciless pounding from the air inflicts dis- 
abling panic, Malraux proclaimed that something 
like a new religion of fear was born in Spain under 
the "menace of the sky." When he is on the street 
and "under fire" from Fascist warplanes, Moreno 
says in Man 's Hope, "I don't believe in 'thinking 
things out' or the 'eternal verities,' or anything at 
all. I believe only in fear. Real fear, not the sort that 
makes one talk, but the fear that sets one running."'" 
In Man's Hope, fear of the sky is a quasi-religious fear 
of the sublime. During an air raid, people hustling 
on the ground are not simply afraid of the actual 
German, Italian, or Spanish warplanes, but are 
overwhelmed as if by a natural disaster, not bomb- 
ing but an "earthquake." Air raids cause the "sort 
of terror a cataclysm inspires." 2 " 

Picasso's fear of air raids, though traceable to his 
brush with the "Zeppelin alarm" in World War I, 
stems directly from his identification with the vic- 
tims of diving and machine-gunning airplanes serv- 
ing Franco in the Spanish Civil War. His fright and

It was, of course, the bombing of Guernica that 
shook Picasso first and marked him forever. After 
all, Guernica remains the paradigmatic outcry 
against destruction from the air, and it was while 
completing it in 1937 that Picasso first explained 
his hypothesis that dark hostile forces control 
events in the here and now and through them 
awaken atavistic terrors. 22 In a performance-collage 
done ad hoc for Roland Penrose and Henry Moore, 
Picasso dramatized the visceral fear of dive-bombers 
tumbling from the "blue [sky, which] sets on fire the 
black of the space" (122); he pinned a "long piece of 
toilet paper" to the hand of the running woman on the 
right of Guernica to bare what he called the "common- 
est and most primitive effect of fear." 23 If scatological, 
this concept was truthful. 

PICASSO'S PRAYER TO THE SKY, 1938 
In 1938, after mangling Guernica, Franco gained 
control of the air and was therefore poised for final 
victory. When Picasso read that "all neighborhoods 
[of Barcelona] had been hit" in March, he is said to 
have fearfully reported to Spanish friends in Paris: 
"My mother is perhaps dead. My loved ones are 
perhaps dead." ' The wickedness of the sky 
reached such a peak for Picasso in 1938 that for 
the first and only time in his writings he ended the 
texts he completed that year by imploring and cast- 
ing a spell on the sky. The "sky bursts and spreads

on the walls and the ceiling its juice of military 
marches" (193); "vipers," not angels, fly in the 
"mathematical square of the air" (196); the "sun 
hidden in a block of ice" is "crushed on the sky 
by the cries of pain" (196); the "gangrene of the 
shadow . . . dives" (178), "hiding the aroma of the 
rays of the rainbow" (180); and a flying Apocalyptic 
"boat [is] detach[ing] [itself] from the ceiling of the 
[world]" (195). Nauseated, Picasso cursed the abra- 
sive "light of the ceiling," swearing to extinguish its 
malice: "throw the ashes of the light of the ceiling 
into the jaws of the drawing that would like to tear 
to pieces the illusion of the hoof of shadow" (183). 

About a month prior to the steady bombing of 
Barcelona between 16 and 18 March 1938, when 
"panic and fear" 2, gripped the civilian population, 
1,300 dying and 2,000 being injured, 2 ' 1 Picasso 
engaged in a surrealist game of questions and 
answers. Underlying this written dialogue with 
himself is the cause-and-effect relation between the 
Republican "pigeons" /planes of peace and the 
"dead citizens" of the Spanish nation. Asking what 
the volitating "veils of pigeons" mean, in a tour de 
force of eliding and coding Picasso answered that 
they stand for the Republic's futile efforts to make 
peace by making war and for the death of the 
Spanish people. "The veils of pigeons" correspond 
to the "weapons of the citizens dead in vain buried 
in the earth and eating the worms of corpses" (180). 2 

Like the running woman in Guernica and like 
Guernico in Man's Hope, who "tried to run, but 
stumbled at every step over heaped up paving 
stones," 2 " Picasso knew fear and the shame of being 
afraid. During World War II he hid under a table 
when he heard what he thought was a bomb blast 
(in fact an exploding kitchen pot). Marie-Therese 
Walter, remembering this humiliating outburst of 
panic, remarked that Picasso behaved egotistically 
and that instead of "protecting our child" thought 
only of his own safety. " Yet his hiding (which was 
also a leitmotif of his wartime writings), was not an 
expression of vulgar selfishness. Rather, it mani- 
fested Picasso's vivid participation in the psycho- 
physiological reactions of those directly targeted by 
terrorism from the air. 1 " In February 1938, for 
example, when the Nazi Condor Legion "began to

ing body and soul with the casualties of Nazi air 
raids became (so to speak) the horse as the exem 
plary victim eviscerated by the bull in his corridas. 
Taking his work as his alter-ego, he wrote: "the 
bowels [are] pulled out of the painting" (174). 

Fear made Picasso hate flying machines. He 
decided that the balloon hovering in his 2(i March 
1938 text above an impaled horse had to be 
downed, filling it not with hot air or lighter-than-air 
gas, but with the heavy sand of seashores, decom- 
posed corpses, and hourglasses. "Having a beauti- 
ful view of the entrails of the disemboweled horse 
rotting on the lawn for centuries," Picasso writes, 
further blurting out his urge to fill "with sand the 
montgolfier" and then "piss upon it" (190-92). He 
composed this furious text about a week after 
Barcelona was bombed on 17-18 March by "rebel 
planes," suffering those two days alone as the 
headlines announced: "EIGHT HUNDRED 
KILLED AND A THOUSAND WOUNDED."' In 
the same torturing early spring, Picasso pasted 
more than twenty maps of the continents on the 
dress of one of the three figures in his huge syn- 
thetic cubist cartoon for a tapestry, Women at Their 
Toilette (fig. 4). This costumed figure is an allegory 
of the planet Earth, threatened, threatening, and 
therefore euphemized, a parody of all nations, 
turning her face away while combing the hair of a 
dejected feminine icon of Spain - in the spirit of 
Picasso's "Samson complex" (or, according to 
his magico-superstitious code, robbing the vital 
energy). Its mirror image is a Picassoesque woman 



THE PRESS AND THE INTELLECTUALS 

Little wonder, then, that at the dawn of World War 
II Picasso's horror of air power escalated. The 
illustrated popular daily L'Excelsior, which Jaime 
Sabartes tells us Picasso read every day, may have 
delivered to him some of the most alarming reports 
on current events before and during the blitzkrieg 
against Poland (fig. ())." Even the more respected 
Le Figaro in July-August 1939 would have 
fomented the anxieties of cerebral and sensitive 
readers such as Picasso. On 3 August, Le Figaro 
published Hermann Goring' s message that, while 
the "diktat of Versaille" had destroyed the German

air force, the fiihrer "offered the German people a 
new" and intrepid Luftwaffe that dwarfed all other 
air forces." But what must have gripped Picasso 
even more were Le Figaro's brutal references to the 
Luftwaffe's raw brawn: its "most modern and pow- 
erful," even "unassailable," sway; its unbearably 
close "maneuvers in the north-west of Germany"; 
its foreboding, brazen violations of Poland's air 
space; and the German "bombers and pursuit 
planes" ready to appropriate for their own use the 
airfields of neighboring Austria. Picasso's daily 
reading of Le Figaro would have included its 
accounts of the large-scale defenses against air 
strikes — 80,000 bomb shelters were being pre- 
pared in Amsterdam alone" - and their corollary, 
the awareness of the sky as alien and menacing. In 
Picasso's imagination, the thousands of bomb shel- 
ters must have anticipated thousands of deaths. 
Shelters against air raids would have been for him 
like graves prepared in advance. 

In August 1939, Le Figaro reported ad nauseam 
on the meticulous preparations in Paris and the 
rest of France of professional, military, and civilian 
measures "CONTRE LES ATTAQUES AERI- 
ENNES."" 1 The imminence of air raids implied by 
the blackout of Paris that month seemed even 
more sinister in Le Figaro's discussion and photo- 
graphic illustration of a grieving "Paris nocturne," 
where "only the metro, at twenty feet beneath the 
earth, retained its scintillating brightness."" 

After the end of August 1939 and particularly 
after Hitler launched his terror bombing of Poland 
on 1 September, the French masses, figures in 
prominent political positions (such as the prime 
minister, Edouard Daladier), and especially French 
intellectuals, were profoundly affected by the fear 
that great cities such as Paris would be demolished 
by aerial bombardments. The prospect of "strate- 
gic terror bombing" stirred the emotions and 
changed the Weltanschauung of Picasso's close 
friends - Sabartes, Brassai, and Penrose — as well 
as of his literary circle and those on its fringes - 
Georges Bataille, 1 ' 1 Simone de Beauvoir," Andre 
Breton," Blaise Cendrars (see below), Max Jacob, 1 ' 
Eugene Jolas,"' Thomas Mann, 17 Lee Miller, '"Jean- 
Paul Sartre (see below), Denis De Rougemont,' 1 ' 



Andre Suares, " and Simone Weil' 1 — to name just a 
few. Suddenly, the commonplace problem of evil 
was urgent. 

In the 5 December 1939 entry of his War Diaries, 
Sartre adopted the theory that Hitler's threat of 
"total war" ~ was designed to avoid it, by producing 
and "exploiting the fear" of an "ever-present 
specter of total war." Sartre suggested the Germans 
would try to win the ongoing "phony war" by 
bombarding France with "fear," not with actual 
bombs: "When Hitler threatens us with a landing 
in England, an air-raid on London, etc., what is he 
doing but summoning up the phantom of total 
war?"'* Fear, Sartre wrote in his War Diaries, is the 
"most intense emotion — more intense than love. It 
would be more accurate to say: the most authen- 
tic." 4 Authentic and potentially annihilating, "fear" 
was above all fear of the "skies with raiding 
German planes."'' In Picasso's emotionally and 
indecently spontaneous terms it was "the sky of the 
night empty of caresses and laughter" (210), or the 
"filthy ass of the sky" (246). 

In his sweeping account of air war during the 
first half of this century, Sky Memoirs, Picasso's old 
friend Cendrars agreed that on 10 May 1940 noth- 
ing "but shit" could come out of the "sky above," 
with its "gleaming buttocks" and "inflamed anus." 
It was not a Christian dome but an Incan "abyss," 
an "absolute and deglutitious black," a "black 
beast, blood, throat, lung, gland," a "living 
sponge": "I have seen this sponge, seen it with my 
own eyes." "' 

To disregard the harshness of history as a condi- 
tion sine qua non of what was written and painted 
at that time is to betray the solemn truth of events, 
to mistake literary and artistic difference with indif- 
ference to the "boundary situations" " of World 
War II, and to opt for an amoral hermeneutics of 
creativity. Picasso was hyperconscious of the sepa- 
rate, intrinsic reality of art, its stylistic require- 
ments, its dependence on the history of art, and 
even on technical accident and chance occurrence, 
yet he saw no polar opposition between art and 
life; existence and history were inevitably 
expressed by the forms and the subject matter of 
his work. "History . . . holds us by the throat no

more and no less" (154), Picasso declared on 10 
February 1937, two days after the defeat of the 
Republicans in the campaign of Malaga, the city 
where he was born." Later, in L939, shortly after 
Franco's final victory, when Hitler's ruthless 
demand that Danzig be returned to Germany pre- 
ambled World War II, Picasso saw himself dying: 
"Between the two windows of the sky this after- 
noon on the twenty-ninth of the month of April in 
the year nine hundred thirty-nine . . . dies the pale 
blue" (201) - the "pale blue" standing for Picasso's 
past. In this almost wholly concrete vision of his 
death on the sky of war, Picasso brings back to 
life the Blue Period of his youth, colored in the 
"blue of [his] cry for pity";"" the artist named 
"Blue," his alias, who found success but lost his 
decency in Louis Aragon's roman a clef, Anicet on 
le panorama; S1 and, finally, the glorified Picasso of 
recent years, still remembered as the painter of the 
"blue period" in Andre Breton's L Amour fou."- 

ROYAN AND PICASSO'S "FEAR OF 
THE FLIGHT OF PARTRIDGES" 

"Don't you know that there is danger that German 
planes will fly over Paris tonight?" Picasso anxiously 
prodded Sabartes. It was probably 3 September 
1030 in the French capital, about four o'clock in the 
afternoon, an hour before France's ultimatum to 
Germany would expire.' ' Picasso's charged question

apprehension, rather than residing in an unfo&lt; used 
fear of war as a whole, was specific all\ an acute

warned Sabartes: "I'm going right home to pack 
my baggage. . . . Pack yours and stop fooling. I'll 
come lor you tonight." ' Picasso packed hurriedl) 
and "towards midnight" he left in his car, a 
Hispano Suiza driven by Marcel, in the compan) 
of Sabartes and his wife, and Dora Maar. The\ 
"sped on at more than one hundred kilometers per 
hour," and arrived the next morning in Royan on 
the Atlantic coast near Bordeaux.'" 

Picasso had already chosen Royan, a resort 
town, as an asylum for Marie-Therese and their 
daughter Maya because it was beyond either the 
predicted advance of the enemy on land or the 
significant civilian targets that Gbring's Luftwaffe 
was expected to hit. From Paris, Royan must have 
seemed to Picasso an almost perfect, Watteauesque 
island of forgetfulness. In Royan itself Le Clairon de 
Saintonge, a local paper, boasted that on 20 August, 
a hundred thousand celebrities from France and 
abroad converged in the city hoping to find there 
the lost "PAYS DU SOURIRE." 

The Royan Picasso found at the beginning of 
September was, however, a reminder of what he 
was trying to escape. When his eyes were opened 
to what was actually happening, he saw a town 
holding its breath, waiting for the war. "During the 
first days of September" in the Charentes region 
(which included Royan), "everything became dra- 
matic." Instead of tourists, troops arrived with "req- 
uisitioned vehicles" and horses, while trainloads of 
"distraught" refugees spilled in from localities close 
to the German frontier. Paradise was swept b\ "I. A 
PEUR DES BOMBARDEMENTS." 

Bluntly if metaphorically, Picasso's 1939-40 
writings convey his mounting phobia of aerial 
terror. Clouds, for example, morph into bombers 
and seem to obsess him. The "clouds"/ "gods" 
in Apollinaire's "Couleur du Temps"" 4 become 
"clouds [diving from the] oily slippers sk\ 
deprived of all security" 235 , the "cloud stopped 
at the [world's] middle" 254 . and "clouds . . . 
of the skv of the great latrine" 220 . The "sk\ . . .

scratches its thorn [horn] against the iron of the 
clouds" (217). "Clouds emanate from the filth of . . . 
the dead sun" (218); "clouds . . . bleed their vomit 
of stars" (222); "clouds [are] sticky with cries" (221); 
the "iron of the clouds carts [airplanes]' " . . . wings 
. . . cold . . . fires" (234-35); the "petrified blazes of 
the clouds" (239); "burned bones of the clouds" 
(252) and [crashing] "clouds . . . drag[ging] belly to 
earth" (253). We begin to understand why "nails 
[are] tearing the skin of the clouds" (214) and why 
the "rotten clouds" (220) are decomposed by 
Picasso's "magic brush" (44). 

Even low-flying partridges sow fear on 4 July 
1940 in the second chapter of Picasso's "corrida in 
mourning" (3 July- 19 August 1940), a narrative col- 
lage of texts informed by the worst early phases of 
the Battle of Britain. On the face of it, fearing puny, 
awkward partridges — the "fear of the flight of par- 
tridges" (216) - seems absurd. Yet Picasso knew 
from Ovid the association of the partridge-Perdrix 
with flying and falling, from Guillaume Apollinaire 
the partridge as French military jargon for shells 
fired by cannons in World War I, and from 
Christian lore its promiscuity and alliance with 
Satan. 7 " Picasso's wretched partridges may have also 
been a euphemism 71 that diminished for him the 
supreme Nazi eagles: the Stukas dive-bombing 
British convoys in the Channel that fourth day of 
July. Incongruously, they also point to the eventual 
victors over the German Stukas, the British 
bombers that attacked the French battleships sta- 
tioned at Mers El-Kebir near Oran, Algeria, one 
day before Picasso expressed his fear of the flight 
of partridges. The British had bombed their former 
allies in an attempt to prevent the defeated French 
from delivering the ships to the Germans. The 
French reading of the incident at Mers El-Kebir as 
a "stab in the back," "treachery," and "perfidious- 
ness" 77 corresponded to the traditional symbolism 
of the partridge in Picasso's text of 4 July, which 
reverberates with the turbulence of Mers El-Kebir, 
as well as the related storm unleashed by the dive- 
bombing Stukas in the Channel. 

Three days later, in Picasso's text of 7 July 1940, 
the winged "eyes of the partridge" watch the bale- 
ful events on earth from the empyreal "firmament 



of gazes" (217). The disorienting moment when, at 
Mers El-Kebir, friend became foe and the Battle of 
Britain was breaking out would have sanctioned 
Picasso's speculations on a universal "enemy!": 73 
"that one far away" (255) who commands all bomb- 
ings in the "year . . . 1940" (254). 74 That Picasso 
began his collage-epic, the "corrida in mourning" 
one day after the Mers El-Kebir affair does not 
appear to be a mere coincidence. The work's com- 
pletion on 19 August 1940 may somehow relate to 
Winston Churchill's famous words, one day later: 
"Never in the field of human conflict was so much 
owed by so many to so few." 75 On 30 July as the 
"First Phase" in the Battle of Britain continued, 7 '' 
the "flight of the partridge" leads an aerial dance of 
death performed by the "black veils of . . . the 
black ceremonies of the agitated air fanned by the 
wings of bats" (227).

In the same way that angels were divided into 
nine orders according to their closeness to God in 
The Celestial Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius, the 
clouds and the eyes of the partridge, along with a 
host of other flying objects, were implicitly classi- 
fied in Picasso's texts. They belonged to a hierar- 
chical system dominated by the "winged eye flying- 
like a ball without stopping from the sky to the 
earth and the earth to the sky" {235). Picasso's 
winged eye is both an archetypal symbol and a 
simile of the winged bomber. It descends from the 
Egyptian (fig. 7) and Renaissance emblems of 
divine omnipresence, omnivision, omniscience, 
and omnipotence. Since it flies at the hour of "last 
judgments" (235), it must also refer to the "main- 
eyes" that "destroy those who are destroying the 
earth" in the Book of Revelation 1:7; 11:18). The 
winged eye was not only a traditional emblem. 
Picasso consecrated it on 13 August 11)40, on the 



same day Goring launched the main air assault 
against Britain. On that day, remembered as the 
Nazi "Day of the Eagle," "wave after wave of 
German aircraft, 1,485 in all, flew in search of the 
air stations and aircraft factories which had to be 
destroyed, and to be destroyed quickly, if invasion 
was to follow." 8 

Picasso's untitled drawing of gyrocompass-eyes 
(fig. 8) is perhaps his most ingenious visual adapta 
tion of the ancient winged eye as an emblem of the 
winged Stukas in the Battle of Britain. Cautious, 
finding a way through the forest of s\ mbols in his 
mind, Picasso places on and around skulls rotating 
gyroscopes inspired by aircraft gvroc ompasses, the 
three-frame directional gyroscopes used to locate 
with precision targets on the land. Picasso renders 
more or less accurately these navigational aids as 
three intersecting circles seen in perspective. But 
he adds eyes with winglike eyelashes, repatenting

signal the London Blitz — and the bombing of 
Berlin by the Royal Air Force. Picasso blinds the 
gyrocompass-eyes: the "compass with blindfolded 
eyes" (231). 

Picasso's sketchbooks and paintings completed 
during the Royan period are punctuated by enig- 
matic transformations of his literary imagery that 
revolve around the "menace of the wing" (65) and 
the "infinite void" (210). Thus Picasso's late 1939 
"drawings in the air" (figs. 9-10), which bring back 
his models for the Monument to Apollinaire, m depict 
ironically the elusive "architectures of the air built 
. . . under the order and commandment of perspec- 
tive authorities" (218). In his texts the "absolute rig- 
orism of the architectural styles of the air [destroys 
Picasso] . . . rub[bing] the skin and the sweat of the 
box of cooked earth [that is, Picasso] which hangs 
up its bowels in the shadow" (231). 

In the breezy studies (fig. II),* 1 drawn in Royan 
on 12 September 1939, volumetric space encloses 
transparent cones, conic sections, stacks of circles, 
polyhedrons, hourglasses, running lines, disori- 
ented planes, hatchings, hooks, a sun, and a star.

Channel and airfields on the English coast. On 7 
November 1940, Picasso reinvoked the winged eye 
as the "vipers raining the scarabs of their syphilitic 
rockets on the empty ground" (253).'' This scene - 
impossible to forget - is a baroque cipher for the 
enemy above, syncretizing popular, ancient Egyp- 
tian, military, and medical myths and memories to

PICASSO'S LIFE IN ROYAN, OR 
THE PAST IN THE PRESENT 

But there was no guerre, none of its horrors, in 
Picasso's everyday life in Royan. The specter of 

air raids seems to have evaporated in his daily 
explorations of the city, which were almost literal 
explorations of the dust that spread over Royan, 
preserving its past. Clashing with Picasso's flam- 
boyant texts from Royan, where the darkness of 
the present prevails and is magically blasted by 
Picasso, Sabartes's recollections of Picasso's repeti 
the behavior in the city describe a journey into 
times past, typical of World War II, when anything 
that had happened before the war could look 
unbelievably innocent and serene. 

Those sections of the citv where Picasso lived 
between 4 September 1939 and 24 August 194(), s 
though altered, still exist. (Royan was severely 
bombed by England's "Oiseaux de Mort" in 
1945.) 86 Today one sees the same long, broad 
curved beach (the Grande Conche), the same small 
port with a ferry, the bubbling marketplace (and 
the "Gare Routiere which from the very first day, 
reminded [Picasso] of the bull rings of Malaga,

dav - at about ten o'clock in the morning, at noon. 
and at sunset - he walked with Sabartes. 

Picasso usualK ended his walk through Royan 
with Sabartes on the boulevard Bottom going b\ 
the monument of Eugene Pelletan (fig. 12 . and 
then stopping in "the little square in front of the 
port where the beach promenade meets the rue 
de I'Hotel de Ville and the boulevard Thiers." 8 A 
sense of deja vu would have been inevitable. For 
there on the beach ol the Grande Conche were 
the same nineteenth-century-style casetasthat, trans- 
figured by his childhood projections of fear and 
desire, had faced him hypnotically as his own 
secret doubles between 1891 and 1895 on the 
Riazor Beach in La Coruiia. " Royan's boxlike 
casetas (fig. 13),"-' fixed on stilts and withdrawn 
behind stylish, nimble canvas tents whose prima 
donna striped regalia trailed across the front stage 
of the Grande Conche, waited for Picasso, solicit- 
ing quietly his return to the land of his childhood 
and early youth. In a split second, Picasso, 
awe-stricken, suspected that the small houses on 
the Grande Conche were setting forth a sober 
epiphany of his past. The little "house bursting 
with memories" (216-17) that drifted ashore on the 
Grande Conche was for Picasso an invitation an 
voyage, an entreaty to ride on the "gallop of remem- 
brances" (213) from Royan and the present to 
far-off places and days long gone. Did he not 
instantly recognize these rigid small houses as 
coded emblems of his hypersensitive body? 93 This 
much is certain: on Christmas Eve 1939, more 
clearly than ever before - in either his other writ- 
ings or in the 1927-38 Cabana series - Picasso, like 
the pilgrims he had painted at La Coruha,"' said: 
This little house on the beach is my mortal bod) 
harboring my immortal soul; it is the caseta made 
of my flesh that partakes in all human "houses of 
the flesh" (227). In its innermost recesses, death, the 
"horns of the sun" fallen from the "skv" and from 
the "clouds," minsded with and dominated the 
undying "How of life" 222).

himself) listened to the radio broadcast of Prime 
Minister Daladier's austere evening address censur- 
ing Hitler's appetite for universal domination. 
Picasso's response, however, contrasted with the 
political perspective Daladier adopted in his outcry 
against the Nazis' "martyrdom of innocents." 11 
Instead, Picasso evaluated the war as aerial 
blitzkrieg and the aerial blitzkrieg as the war of 
heaven against the earth, as "death falling from 
heaven." He did not lay blame on Hitler's 
Luftwaffe alone. For him, the adversary manipu- 
lating the Hitlerian lackeys was the "infinite void" 
(210), a plenum of sovereign death. It was this void 
that was in the last instance accountable for the 
cruel flaying of the vulnerable house substituting 
for Picasso's body and for "destroying]," he would 
explain, all human "houses of the flesh.""" 

The nostalgic casetas on La Grande Conche, the 
eerie statue of Pelletan (who, traversing the roman- 
tic revolution, became Leon-Michel Gambetta's 
counselor after the Paris Commune), the "trinkets" 
at the marketplace in Royan, the dusty antiques 
at the popular "Hotel des Ventes," the rubbish 
exhibited at the "wretched little store" (the spooky 
"rabbit skin," the magical "nails," the Hermetic 
"toothless keys," the Darwinian "monkey"), and 
the wrinkled Lady of the Past wearing dust as

makeup"' - all that solicited Picasso in Royan made 
concrete for him traces of a warless time in the 
warring present. Charged with the diffuse mean- 
ings he bestowed upon them but stark in their own 
solidity, all those "found objects" were "lost 
objectfs]" 98 aiding him to see more clearly within 
himself and materializing the immaterial past he so 
urgently needed to recapture — a stay against the 
constraints imposed by the war. The shrines to 
bygone primitive eras represented for Picasso the 
temporal framework in which his infantile, irra- 
tional, and magical creative selves existed. To 
reconcile objective time, September 1939 to August 
1940, when he lived in Royan, with the subjective 
time when the child and the magician in the 
mature and rational Picasso were engaged in 
creative activities, he had to establish the following 
equation: the time in Royan equaled the time of his 
inner creative self, which equaled his wonder-filled 
past. Finding the "lost" object was, then, to find 
himself; discovering it was self-discovery. Driven 
by fear and aiming to alleviate it, Picasso's 
return to times past in his daily routine and to an 
unconscious, childish, and magical self in his work 
coalesced into an appropriate conjunction of 
existential and creative complementaries."" 

On 15 August 1940, the day after what the local 
press described as the assassination of a sentinel 
guarding the German Kommandatur, a stray bul- 
let penetrated the dining room on the main floor 
below Picasso's studio at Les Voiliers. The situation 
was tense. Unknown people, perhaps engaged in 
pre-Resistance activities, had already several 
times cut one of the Germans' electric cables near 
Royan."" The Germans threatened "capital punish- 
ment" and warned that they would take "hostages" 
to "guarantee" the "cessation of sabotage." M2 
Picasso challenged them in return. The errant bul- 
let of 15 August could only have been fired by the 
swastika-emblazoned German plane performing 
acrobatic stunts above the port: "This bullet was 
shot down from above and at very close range."' 

Picasso painted the uncanny Cafe at Royan on the 
day of the stray bullet (fig. 14). This painting is a 
chilling portrait of the city's Cafe des Bains, as a 
midday ghost seen from Les Voiliers. It represents

immobilizing torpor of late summer and the stagna-

of the Occupation, the uninhabited Cafe des Bains, 
soaked through by the mother-of-pearl light of the 
town, arises from the substanceless, emptv Botton 
Square that Picasso could see from his studio. Its 
windows and doors are blank, the colorful striped 
awnings are lifted but show nothing, the pointed 
tents on the Grande Conche zigzag in the far back- 
ground, a forlorn lighthouse dissolves on a jettv in 
the middle ground, and a flag opens like a crying 
beak over a schematic boat. Nobody is in or 
around the cafe. It evokes the deserted Botton 
Square where the Germans had played their first 
conceit one day earlier. 1 "' The vacant Cafe at Royan 
tells the story of a city whose population is in 



hiding after the invader has left. The Sartrean

There were moments when Picasso distinctly 
conceived writing as a substitute for painting and 
painting as a form of writing. Picasso's Royan texts 
are written paintings, as meaningful if not as expert 
as his painted paintings (fig. 15). "Write, man, write. 
Write no matter what," Picasso urged Sabartes. 
"Write, and you will see that all your blues will 
disappear, and that you will feel better."

From Guernica to The Charnel House. 
The Political Radicalization 
of the Artist 

Gertje R. Utley 



I, 



.n October 1JM4, shortly after the 
liberation of Paris, Picasso claimed that 
he had always stood against tyranny and dictator- 
ship and fought with the weapons of his art, like a 
true revolutionary. 1 Yet very little evidence of polit- 
ical engagement in his art exists prior to the late 
1930s. Even then, Picasso's political radicalization 
was gradual, progressing from his embrace - yet 
arguably moderate support - of the anti-Fascist 
policies of the Popular Front in France and of the 
Loyalist cause in the Spanish Civil War, to his 
open commitment to the French Communist Party. 

Picasso's contacts with anarchist circles during 
his formative years in turn-of-the-centui \ 
Barcelona are certainly at the root of his political 
inclinations." The paintings of his Blue Period, in 
their focus on the poor and downtrodden, reflect 
many of the qualities of contemporary anarchist liter- 
ature. In their depictions of misery, however, they 
also engage in the typically symbolist tendency to 
aestheticize it. Picasso's lifelong opposition to all 
armed conflict may stem from these early influ- 
ences as well. Clues to his pacifist stance have been 
discovered in several of the newspaper clippings 
in his synthetic cubist papiers colles: Though the 
dogmatic intent of those works is questionable, the 



reception of cubism by contemporary critics was 
at times couched in political argument. Some saw 
anarchist destructiveness in these works; others 
thought they recognized their reactionary basis.' 

Following World War I, a momentous event 
largely ignored in Picasso's oeuvre, his marriage 
to Olga Khokhlova, the Russian ballerina of 
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, introduced him to a life 
of bourgeois placidity. Only his contact with the 
radicalized milieu of the surrealists, with figures 
such as Louis Aragon, Andre Breton, Georges 
Bataillc, Michel Leiris, Christian Zervos, Tristan 
T/.ara, and in particular Paul Fluard, led him back 
into the sphere of left-wing political thinking. 
Lluard, in particular, the first among the surrealists 
to join the Communists in September 1!)2(&gt;, trans- 
mitted to Picasso his conception of the responsi- 
bility and the militant role of the artist in society. 1 ' It 
was Eluard who introduced Picasso to the surrealist 
photographer and, later, painter, Dora Maar, 
whose sharp intelligence and strong connections 
to left wing radical groups certainly influenced 
Picasso's political thought. 

When ideological differences, and the first round 
of what would be called la bataille du realisme, 
divided the surrealists. Picasso remained (loser lo 



(,&lt;i 



the Stalinist faction around Aragon. In his first 
public political stance, taken in 1932, Picasso 
became co-signatory of a petition in defense of 
Aragon, convicted for incitement to violence in 
his poem "Front rouge." 8 This, however, did not 
impress the Soviet embassy in Paris, which dis- 
couraged its government's interest in Picasso in 
1933 with the argument that he was little more 
than a leftist bourgeois. " 

Still, shortly after the victory of the Popular 
Front in France, and before the outbreak of the 
Spanish Civil War, one of Picasso's watercolors, 
Composition with Minotaur (28 May 1936), reveals 
beneath a wealth of private symbolism his sympa- 
thy for the Popular Front, or, at the very least, 
for its anti-Fascist stance (fig. 1).'" The watercolor 
was reproduced and used as the stage curtain for 
Romain Rolland's play Le 14 juillet. In fact, it was 
specifically created for that purpose, and much of 
its imagery is derived from the Rolland text." 

Romain Rolland's play was selected as the 
central cultural event of the first 14th of July cele- 
brations by the new Popular Front government, 
which sought to reemphasize the symbolic force 
of the storming of the Bastille. Louis Aragon and 
Jean Cassou, the principal figures behind the 
Communist-inspired Maison de la Culture, were 
charged with the organization of the event as early 
as May 1936. 12 As both were close to Picasso, they 
probably approached him with the project. 

In Picasso's watercolor, a monstrous bird-man 
carries the seemingly lifeless body of the minotaur, 
costumed as a harlequin, in a poetic blend of sev- 
eral of Picasso's alter egos. Their macabre progress 
is restrained by a bearded man, who carries on his 
shoulders a youth with outstretched arms. Cloaked 
in the hide of a horse, like Hercules in his lion skin, 
the man raises his right fist in defiance. At the time, 
there was no mistaking the symbol of the raised fist 
as the Communist salute. It also had become the 
greeting of the Spanish Republicans, a gestural 
polemic in response to the raised open palm of

the Hitler- Gruss, used by Franco's supporters. 
Moreover, the image of the youth on the shoulders 
of the older man is taken directly from the ending 
of Rolland's play, where the child Julie, "our little 
Liberty," is carried in triumph on the shoulders of 
the character Hoche, her arms stretched out to the 
people of Paris. The vulturelike monster, on the 
other hand, although physically derived from 
Goya, relates directly to the final words of 
Rolland's companion play Danton, in which the 
character Saint-Just proclaims, "The Republic will 
never be pure until the vultures are no more."' 1 

Picasso's conscious use of Communist symbols 
is even more intelligible in a large pencil drawing 
of a fortnight later, which depicts a youthful crowd 
storming the Bastille (fig. 2). 14 The mood is part 
celebratory and part combative: people dance, 
fists are raised, and banners carry the hammer- 
and-sickle motifs. 

The militant symbolism of Picasso's curtain was 
carried out in the performance, with the masses 
played by workers' theater groups. It ended with 
both actors and audience, fists raised, singing 
"La Marseillaise" and the "Internationale." 1, In a 
further gesture of allegiance, Picasso watched the

march of the rassemblement populaire from the 

balcony of the theater." 

Four days later, on 18 July, the Spanish Civil 
War erupted. There was no doubt which side 
Picasso would support, 1 yet he hesitated to become 
personally involved. Even after the Republican 
government named him director of the Museo 
Nacional del Prado in September 1936, Picasso did 
not follow their repeated invitations to come to 
Spain. Is Yet he clearly appreciated the honor and, 
on several occasions, defended the efforts of the 
Republic to protect Spain's artistic treasures. Years 
later he would jest that he probably still was the 
director of the Prado, as nobody had bothered to 
fire him. 1 " Roland Penrose recalls that Picasso's 
anxiety about the events in Spain was intense; 
indeed, much of Picasso's work from that period, 
especially from early HK57, is suffused with 
anguish. However, like Eluard, who talked about 
action but restricted his fight to the weapons of his 
poetry, Picasso largely confined his demonstrations 
of sympathy to his art. JI The attitudes of the two

friends reflected the postulates of the international 
writers' conference held in Valencia in Jul) 1937, 
which declared literal - ) activism to be as valuable an 

engagement in the cause as an) action in the field. 

Picasso's most obvious political work, and his 
clearest condemnation of Franco and the i liuu h 
that supported him, are his etchings in comic strip 
form. Dream and Lie of Franco, of earl) Januar) 1937 
(cat. no. 2). Picasso's caricature of Franco as an 
absurd and vainglorious bigot and of his calami- 
tous effect on civilization and the cr\ ilian popula 
tion was the expression ol his outrage about the 
victimization of the Spanish people. Picasso's 
sudden artistic reaction to the war in Spain 
possibly was aroused by the distressing accounts 
he received, in early January 1!)37, from the 
Spanish poet and essayist Jose Bergamin, who 
was the Republic's cultural attache in Paris." 

Why did it take the attack on Guernica to rally 
Picasso's full commitment to the program ol the 
Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World's Fair of Ma\ 
1937? Bv their presence the Republicans envisaged 
achieving a specific political goal: the reaffirmation 
of their legitimacy as the elected government of 
Spain, and the enlistment of the free world in their 
support. When first approached by a delegation 
from the Republican government, headed by his 
fnend Josep Lluis Sert, the architect of the Spanish 
Pavilion, Picasso was less than enthusiastic . 

Was Picasso's reluctance prompted by his earlier 
claim that he would never put his art at the sen ice 
of an ideology?-" Or was it caused by his disenchant- 
ment with the schism in the Republican camp 
in Spain, which was plagued by disagreements 
over its revolutionary mission?" According to 
his nephewjavier Vilato, Picasso knew about 
and could not ignore the strife between the lac 
lions within the Popular Front in Spain, nor the 
Communists' violent suppression and eradication 
of the revolutionary elements in the ami Fascist 
militias. ' This would explain his initial reticence 
to publicly back the Republican government, 
which by that time was firml) under pro Soviet 
Communist control. 

It took three months tor Picasso to relent and 
begin work on some preparaloiv drawings for the 



GERTJE R. UTLE1 :i 



Spanish Pavilion. Even then, his subject, the artist 
in his studio — although a frequent theme in his 
oeuvre — appears to reflect Picasso's desire to 
remain in his ivory tower. 30 Given Picasso's 
restrained political stance at the time, it is reason- 
able to assume that in painting Guernica (see pages 
40-41, fig. 1) he was motivated less by the politics 
of the Spanish Civil War than by the human drama 
of the destruction of the Basque town. 31 The sense- 
less brutality of the bombing must have convinced 
Picasso of the Republicans' argument that the fight 
against Franco and his allies had to take prece- 
dence over internal conflict. Indeed, on 1 May, 
four days after the bombing of Guernica, Picasso 
began sketches related to its devastation. In study 
after study Picasso filtered the destruction of 
Guernica through the prism of the iconography of 
the bullfight, the Crucifixion, and the life, love, and 
death of the Minotaur, all of which had occupied 
much of his recent work, as well as through images 
derived from private experience. 

Dora Maar's photographs of the different states of 
the painting in progress reveal that Picasso's concept 
evolved from a frankly militant vocabulary (fig. 3), 
to the universal image of suffering of the final 
version. Here, as in most of Picasso's later so-called 
history paintings, we are made to empathize with 
the victims, while the perpetrator is present only in 
the destruction he left behind. The Spanish govern- 
ment, disappointed with Picasso's insufficiently 
partisan approach, even considered removing the

canvas from the pavilion, a step prevented only by 
their fear of adverse publicity. 32 Still, Guernica did 
not totally fail as an instrument of propaganda. 
The Germans, while dismissing it alternately as the 
work of either a lunatic or of a four-year-old, were 
sensitive to its damning message and regarded it 
as a provocation in form and content. 33 

Picasso donated Guernica to the Spanish 
Republic, and contributed the sum of 150,000 
francs he received for expenses to the fund for 
Republican exiles." The fund also benefited from 
the proceeds of the many charitable exhibitions of 
Guernica and its related works and from the sale of 
the limited folio edition of Dream and Lie of Franco}' 
Picasso participated in fund-raising efforts such 
as exhibitions and auctions to benefit Spanish 
refugees, signed numerous declarations in support 
of the Republic, and became involved with several 
refugee relief organizations. 3 " He donated milk for 
the children in Barcelona, helped finance a hospital 
for Republican refugees in Toulouse, and was par- 
ticularly active in securing the liberation of Spanish 
intellectuals from French internment camps. 37 In 
his postwar painting Monument to the Spanish Who 
Died for France (Monument aux Espagnols morts 
pour la France) (cat no. 83), Picasso would com- 
memorate the plight of the Republican refugees 
who, caught between Franco's Spain and Vichy 
France, had joined the French Resistance. 3X On a 
personal level, he assisted many friends or even 
strangers who appealed to his generosity. 31 ' Most 
of his donations remain unnamed, in part because 
of the necessarily clandestine nature of such opera- 
tions."' It seems that even during the Occupation 
he tried various ways to smuggle money into 
Spain, an effort that nearly cost him his freedom, 
if not his life." 

When Guernica was on view in New York, the 
Museum of Modern Art emphasized that Picasso 
himself had denied the painting any political 
significance, stating simply that "the mural 
expresses his abhorrence of war and brutality." 
However, in a letter to the New York Times, Picasso 
was more explicit in his denunciation of General 
Franco's military insurrection: "In all my recent 
works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence 



72 FROM GUERNICA TO THE CHARNEL HOUSE 



of the military caste, which has sunk Spain in an 
ocean of pain and death."' Years later Picasso told 
his old friend, the poet Rafael Alberti: "The truth 
of the matter is that by means of Guernica I have 
the pleasure of making a political statement every 
day in the middle of New York City." ; 

Increasingly, the success of the widely traveled 
painting conferred upon Guernica the status of a 
public statement against Fascist aggression, and 
its political potential came to be valued. Whether 
Picasso was motivated by political or bv humani- 
tarian incentives in painting his mural, it was as the 
painter of Guernica that he came to be seen as a 
politically valuable asset, or conversely, as a liabil- 
ity and even a threat." The process of Picasso's 
own further radicalization was largely a response to 
the legacy of responsibility that Guernica imposed 
upon him. 

Picasso himself claimed that it took the experi- 
ence of World War II to make him understand that 
it was not enough to manifest political sympathies 
under the discreet veil of mythologized artistic 
expression.' Except for less than a year in Royan, 
Picasso spent the period of the Nazi Occupation in 
Paris. Most contemporary witnesses agreed with 
Eluard that, during the Occupation, Picasso was 
"one of the rare painters to have behaved prof) 
erly ' " Recent rumors accuse Picasso of a privi- 
leged position and self-serving contacts with the 
Germans.' But a closer look at these accusations, 
as well as a more probing inquiry into the political 
and social realities of life in occupied Paris, show 
that Picasso indeed preserved the dignity that his 
friends so admired."* 

Although Picasso did at times receive members 
of the Occupation forces at his studio," his recep- 
tion of them seems to have conformed to Jean 
Texcier's Conseils a I'occupe. In this short manual on 
proper behavior under the Occupation, Texcier, a 
militant Socialist, recommended a civilized com- 
portment toward the occupier without, however, 
initiating any contact. The documented visits by 
Gerhard Heller, Hans Kuhn, and Ernst Jiinger 
illustrate, in fact, the paradoxical twists and com- 
plexities of relationships under the Occupation, 
for they were accompanied by Jean Paulhan, a 



member of the intellectual Resistance and one 
of the founders ol the clandestine Editions de 

Minuit. The two Germans also visited Braque and 
Fautrier, whom Heller later watched as he painted 

one of the Hostage series (e.g., page 105, fig. 8 . 

It would have been extremely difficult for 
Picasso to conceal am questionable dealings with 
the Germans or to receive secret and unrecorded 
visitors. Picasso was almost constant!) surrounded 
by friends, main of whom lived within the radius 
of a five-minute walk. Georges Hugnet speaks of 
shared lunches on a nearly daily basis. Moreover, 
Picasso's studio provided a meeting place where 
even members of the underground felt sale. Main 
of Picasso's friends were anti-Fascists and, with the 
noted exception of Jean Cocteau, personallv 
involved in, or at least close to the Resistance.' 1 
Andre Fougeron, the militant Communist painter, 
told me that Picasso, who was aware of his 
Resistance activities, was always accessible when 
he came to visit. ' Had there been any question 
about Picasso's loyalties, Andre Malraux would 
scarcely have come to see him while on a clandes- 
tine mission for the maquis. Nor would his friends 
Michel and Louise Leiris have introduced him 
to Laurent Casanova, a four-time escapee from 
the Nazis, who was in hiding in their apartment. 
Casanova was a Resistance fighter, a high-ranking 
member of the politburo of the French Communist 
Party and rumored to have been Stalin's man in 
France. A lawyer by training and a man ot erudi- 
tion and considerable charm, he made a great 
impression on Picasso and mav have been 
influential in Picasso's decision to join the part) 
after the Liberation. 

Picasso did not personally participate in the 
Resistance; however, his close association with the 
underground through his friends demanded more 
courage than is generally granted him. We must 
not forget that Picasso's active and vocal opposi- 
tion to Franco and his German supporters during 
the civil war already brought him the notoriet) "I 
being "red as the reddest of the Spanish revolution 
aries." It is, furthermore, likelv that his denuncia- 
tion as a "degenerate" artist had as much to do 
with Picasso's political stance .is with his artisti)

style. Indeed, many of his paintings that had 
been sold at the auction of "degenerate" art from 
German museums in Lucerne, injune 1939, as well 
as those that were stored in the infamous Salle des 
Martyrs at the Musee du Jeu de Paume, lack the 
characteristics that were denounced by the Nazis as 
"entartete kunst" (degenerate art), and belong to the 
least distorted among Picasso's oeuvre (fig. 4). 59 

Picasso's well-known political stance excluded 
him from several exhibitions of Spanish art during 
the Occupation.'" At other times, the presence of 
his paintings in an exhibition could be seen as 
provocation. For example, in March 1943 he 
participated in an exhibition on the influence of 
African art on modern painters, a theme sure to be 
criticized as "degenerate."" Equally provocative 



was Picasso's contribution, in May 1944, to an 
exhibition of artists' palettes in the Galerie Rene 
Breteau. Picasso's exhibit consisted of a double 
page of a newspaper, which was indeed what he 
used to mix his colors.'"' Picasso must have recalled 
that, in 1939, a photo of his work table with just 
such a newspaper palette had been barred by 
French censors because of the possible political 
content of the newsprint.' 1 Moreover, Picasso could 
have anticipated that the publication of two of his 
poems in Confluences (Lyon) in November 1942 
would be perceived as "striking evidence of literary, 
spiritual, and moral decadence.""' This was a dan- 
gerous comment in view of the fact that the fight 
against moral decadence was the banner under 
which Vichy led its racist and xenophobic politics.'' 1 

It also required some degree of courage to coop- 
erate with the underground surrealist publication 
La Main a plume, created at the end of August 1941, 
with the express intent to resist with the weapon of 
literature. The publication is said to have survived 
in part because of Picasso's generosity; he gave 
financial help, provided illustrations, and, for the 
cover of the summer 1942 issue, "La Conquete du 
monde par l'image," he contributed a signed and 
dated photo of his bull's head assembled from the 
seat and handlebars of a bicycle." 1 ' It is surely no 
coincidence that Picasso contributed his talent to 
illustrate the works of the poets of the Resistance — 
Paul Eluard, Georges Hugnet, Robert Desnos, and 
Maurice Toesca — while he apparently refused to 
work for writers accused of collaborating. 

Picasso had told Francoise Gilot that he was not 
looking for risks to take, but, he added "in a sort of 
passive way I don't care to yield to either force or 
terror."" 7 His attitude was facilitated by the network 
of protectors, which he most probably owed to his 
friendship with Jean Cocteau.' s Numerous accounts 
of intellectual life during the Occupation reveal 
that differences between resisters and collaborators 
could be shelved when it came to saving the life of 
a friend, though the tragic case of Max Jacob 
showed that even the help of the most powerful 
friends would not always come in time."" 

Although Picasso's style during the war years was 
more them ever antithetical to Nazi artistic doctrines, 



7 I I ROM GUERNICA TO THE CHARNEL HOUSE 



it seems highly overstated to interpret his work 
as "a barely concealed action against fascism. " 
Picasso later claimed that the war was reflected in 
his paintings, but he consistently omitted, and in 
one case even obliterated, clear references to it. 
In painting out the prison bars, bread, and water 
jug in the background of Portrait of Dora Maar 
(9 October 1942), Picasso effaced what would have 
been his most direct allusion to life under the 
Occupation during those years. 71 But this was true 
in general. While French artists had freely depicted 
their militant opposition to the civil war in 
Spain, there was practically no reflection of the 
Occupation in their work during those years." 
Andre Fougeron's Rue de Paris 43, which he exhib- 
ited in the Salon des Tuileries in 1943, was among 
the rare exceptions (fig. 5). Fougeron, who was 
charged by the Communist underground to create 
the Front national des arts, found it extremely "dif- 
ficult to enlist artists to manifest resistance through 
their painting."' 1 Picasso himself wondered why so 
few artists, as compared to writers and poets, were 
insurrectionaries: "Is it due to their trade?" he 
asked. "Were van Gogh and Cezanne really less 
audacious in mind than Victor Hugo?" 7 

The only truly militant expression to emerge 
from the artistic resistance was the album Vaincre. 
Assembled by Fougeron, in April 1944, with the 
collaboration of eight artists (including Boris 
Taslitzky, who was still in Buchenwald), it formed 
a collection of aggressive satirical attacks more 
caricature than painting on Vichy and the Nazis. 

After the war, several critics and artists — 
Picasso's friend the Communist painter Edouard 
Pignon among them — claimed that any manifes- 
tation of avant-garde art during the Occupation 
should be seen as a veiled resistance to fascism. 
This is, for example, how the vibrant colors and 
surrealist abstractions of the "Jeunes Peintres 
de Tradition Francaise" came to be viewed. 
However, the surprisingly liberal attitude of the 
Germans with regard to the cultural life of Paris 
deprives this contention of credibility. ' 

In 19 1 1, for post-Liberation Paris, Picasso 
became the "svmbol of regained freedom," "le 
porte-drapeau de la France resistante" (the standard 




Andre Fougeron, Rue de Paris li, I'M : ( &gt;il mi canvas, 5 '■ • 17 in 1 17 ■

bearer of resisting France).'" In his highly visible 
role in all events related to the celebrations of lib- 
eration, Picasso headed several delegations honor- 
ing the victims of fascism who had died in the 
Resistance."" He was also commissioned to draw 
the frontispiece for the special volume Florilege des 
poetes et peintres de la Resistance, presented as a token 
of gratitude by the poets and painters of the 
Resistance to General Charles de Gaulle. 

Most significantly, Picasso was honored with a 
retrospective of his work at the Salon d'Automne 
of 19 11, a recognition rarely bestowed on a foreign 
artist. On ."&gt; October 1944, one da) before the 
opening of the Salon, the Communist dailv

sensibilities. The Salon that year was (ailed the

Salon de la Liberation and was clearly supposed to 
symbolize restored French culture. 8 " It could be 
expected that to offer a foreigner center stage on 
such a patriotic occasion would generate opposi- 
tion. Yet the extent of the ensuing uproar, the so- 
called scandale du Salon d'Automne, was unforeseen."' 
Rallying around Picasso, the Communists blamed 
the demonstration on reactionary initiatives, and 
compared it to the "intimidation tactics experi- 
enced under Nazi occupation." 8 ' Before the war 
Picasso had never exhibited in the official salons. 
His participation in the Salon de la Liberation was 
his first gesture as an artist to manifest his alle- 
giance to the party: it was intended to demonstrate 
his desire to be in closer touch with the public.

When asked to explain his new affiliation, 
Picasso's statements echo the unfocused, romantic 
ideals that led so many intellectuals to join the 
Communist ranks: 

I have become a Communist because our party strives 
more than any other to know and to build the world, 
to make men clearer thinkers, more free and more 
happy. I have become a Communist because the 
Communists are the bravest in France, in the Soviet 
Union, as they are in my own country, Spain. I have 
never felt more free, more complete than since I 
joined. . . . I am again among brothers.*' 

Undeniably, the experience of the Occupation 
and the courage of his friends in the Resistance 
played an important part in Picasso's commitment 
to communism. Mercedes Guillen recalls how dis- 
tressed Picasso was about the execution of the 
Communist journalist Gabriel Peri in December 
1941, and how deeply moved he was by Peri's 
famous last letter. Written moments before Peri's 
execution, it contained the now legendary phrase 
that communism prepared "les lendemains qui 
chantent" (the tomorrows that sing). 1 "' 

Like many others who had joined the party dur- 
ing the war or in the early days of the Liberation, 
Picasso was no Marxist in the ideological sense of 
the word; in all likelihood had never even read 
Marx. 8 ' As Malraux observed, it was less through 
the study of ideas than through general osmosis 
that Marx's ideas spread in France, where commu- 
nism grew largely out of the revolutionary legacy 
of 1789. 88 Moreover, the rise of fascism in the 1920s 
and 1930s, the Communists' opposition to Hitler, 
and Soviet military support for the Spanish 
Republican struggle against Franco's insurgency 
boosted the party's credibility. K!l 

In the aftermath of the Liberation, while de 
Gaulle was seen as the savior of France, the 
Communists were, for a while, the true beneficiaries 
of postwar political currents. Never before or after 
did the Communist Party have such universal 
appeal in France, and in particular among the 
French intelligentsia.'"' The Communists' claim to a 
courageous, if belated, role in the French Resistance

provided moral authority." Moreover, the Soviet 
Union, as the country that had suffered the heavi- 
est losses, was considered by many French to be 
the true vanquisher of Nazi Germany.'" In becom- 
ing a Communist, a Frenchman could identify with 
the victor over fascism and play a role in averting 
future aggressions against humanity." Recent expe- 
rience effaced the memory of Stalin's show trials of 
the 1930s, and for Picasso, too, it seems to have 
obliterated his awareness of the Communists' 
brutal suppression of anarchist movements in 
Spain. From now on he was to subscribe to the 
Communists' claim that they offered the only 
viable alternative to Fascism." 

Although Picasso was not - and was not 
expected to be — a major player in the mechanics 
of party life, he was precious to the party for the 
prestige his membership conveyed, and useful to 
the party's image as the champion of a national 
cultural renaissance. "' He was valued as an effective 
magnet in the party's drive to capture the imagina- 
tion of great numbers of potential supporters and 
members. Later, in a world divided by the Cold 
War, his presence was seen as lending legitimacy to 
the Communists' claim that theirs was indeed the 
side of culture and peace. 

Picasso's formal alliance with the party that 



proclaimed itself to be the champion ol the masses, 
which clearh expected him to create an ait ol 
social and political relevance, had kindled his 
desire to address his new audience more effe&lt; 
lively. He gave fresh thought to the signifying 
potential of his art, once even comparing it to 
Christ's use ol parables, "so that it would be 
accessible to the w idest possible audience.'"' 

In February 1945, Picasso started the first 
sketchv drawings in preparation lor his grim, 
monochromatic canvas, the Charncl House, which 
was his first attempt to assimilate the political tenor 
of Communist Party rhetoric into his art (cat. no. 82). 
In the earliest compositional study (13 February), 
the group of victims from the Charnel House can be 
recognized in the upper register of the drawing 
(fig. 6). Above them, cursor}- lines suggest a hillv 
landscape where a new crop of wheat and a 
crowing rooster bespeak renewal sprung from the 
sacrifice of the victims. In its posterlike use of tradi 
tional images of rebirth and resurrection, the sketch 
conveys the party's militant optimism in a renais- 
sance for which it became the self-declared chain 
pion. Although the image curiously echoes similar 
claims under Petain (fig.7), its apparent rhetorical 
intent has a precedent in the second state of 
Guernica — in the declamatory image of the dead 
warrior holding a sheaf of wheat high before the 
rising sun (fig. 3).

In the finished painting, the scene of death — a 
pyramid of the massacred bodies of a family — has 
taken over the major part of the canvas. Open 
fields have given way to claustrophobic enclosure, 
and the symbols of renewal have been replaced 
by a still life, a close citation of Picasso's canvas

about which Picasso said to Pierre Daix: "You see

in Picasso's work during the months of February 
and March 1945, while he was working on the 
Charnel House, it is clear that for Picasso the associa- 
tion between nature morte and the meditation on 
death goes beyond the simple play on words. 

The atypically slow progress of the painting, 
the hesitations, and the presence of so many penti- 
menti seem to exceed the artistic search for formal 
solutions and enter the delicate sphere of defining 
a moral and political position. The four photos 
that Christian Zervos took in February, April, 
May, and after mid-July of Picasso's work on the 
painting allow us to follow his progress, and to 
infer meaning from transformation (figs. 9-12). 

The focus of the painting and the object of 



Picasso's major hesitations is the representation 
of the male victim. Bound like the lamb in the 
sculpture of the Man with a Lamb (ca. March 1943; 
cat. no. 66) his neck twisted and elongated in 
expressive dislocation like that of the horse in 
Guernica, he brings to mind all the personifications 
of sacrificed innocence in Picasso's artistic vocabu- 
lary. The crosslike configuration between his arm 
and the post to which he is bound and the leanness 
of his torso call forth images of the sacrifice on 
Golgotha as much as they do contemporary 
concentration camp photos. One of his palms is 
opened in acceptance, like that of the crucified 
Christ in Matthias Griinewald's Isenheim Altar (see 
page 82, fig. 1); the other is clenched in a fist and 
provocatively raised in the Communist salute, 
identifying him with the militancy of the dead war- 
rior in the earliest states of Guernica. The consecu- 
tive states of the painting reveal Picasso's 
vacillation between representing the man with 
open palms or with clenched fists, between the 
Christian icon of redemption and the Communist 
symbol for militant strife. This hesitation illustrates 
Picasso's difficulty in deciding between belief in 
resurrection based on forgiveness or on the militant 
call for retribution. The compromise that Picasso 
chose in the final version (cat. no. 82), one hand

clenched, one open, echoes the Communist credo 
that the belief in the rebirth of France had to 
coexist with the partisan call for revenge; or in the 
words of UHumanite, "For the salvation of human- 
ity, hatred - today - is still essential." " 

In spring 1945, the euphoria over the Liberation 
was tragically challenged by the full disclosure 
of Nazi brutalities (Auschwitz was liberated on 
1!) Januarv 1945), by fear for the lives of hundreds 
of thousands of French political prisoners still in 
German captivity, and by the continuation of the 
war. In France a new war had started: I'epuration, 
the purge of Nazi collaborators as a precondition 
for the renaissance francaise, was an important item 
on the agenda of the French Communists. Picasso, 
whose ties to the party were at their closest during 
those months, and who had donated the Charnel 
House to benefit one of its charities, shared these 
sentiments. He was full of scorn toward the artists 
who, like Derain, Vlaminck, and Othon Friesz, had 
helped the Germans in their propaganda efforts. 
On 3 October 1944, the eve of his official enroll 
ment in the French Communist Party, Picasso 
presided at a meeting of the Comite directeur 
du Front national des arts, which was held at his 
studio and at which the punishment of artists and 
critics suspected of collaboration was demanded." 



Picasso's signature under the introductory state- 
ment to the catalogue for the Communist-spon 
sored exhibition Art et resistance in early 19 1(&gt;. 
where the Charnel House was first shown, confirms 
that the painting was meant as a militant call for 
"justice toward those whose sacrifice secured the 
survival of France." 

The Charnel House, unprecedented in Picasso's 
oeuvre for its brutal imagery, unmitigated b\ the 
mvthologizing symbolism that pervades Guernica, 
illustrates Picasso's claim that "painting is not made 
to decorate apartments. It's an offensive and defen- 
sive weapon against the enemy,"' a weapon 
Picasso would continue to use on behalf of the 
Communist Party well into the first decade of 
the Cold War.

Where Do They Come From- 
Those Superb Paintings and Horrid 
Women of "Picasso's War"? 



Brigitte Baer 



W, 



ar is generalized catastrophe, and 
no doubt it was Matthias Griinewald 
who first and best portrayed the great catastrophe 
in his Crucifixion for the Isenheim Altar (fig. 1). Here, 
probably for the first time, it is not the Man- God 
who is dying in order to return to his Father, but 
rather a man, already putrescent, who is dying, 
abandoned by everyone - by his friends the apos- 
tles, his omnipotent Father, and even his mother, 
who dances the dance of death with her substitute 
son, the young Saint John. 

To be sure, Mary Magdalen, who loves him, 
weeps at his feet, and Saint John the Baptist, the 
last prophet, the Precursor (who died because of a 
woman), points his finger for us all to see the Fate 
of Man: Ecce Homo. In this painting there is no 
hope, no possible Resurrection, but only solitude, 
the hopeless horror of death, and perhaps even the 
Crucified's scorn and hatred. It is therefore not sur- 
prising that the veil of the temple was torn and the 
sky darkened in broad daylight. Nor is it surprising 
that this altarpiece was rediscovered in our 
pessimistic century, which is full of catastrophes. 
The great catastrophe, for a painter, has always 
been the Crucifixion (most men, and in any case 
painters who are or feel themselves to be marginal 



and to have a kind of mission, like Jesus, identify 
with Christ at some time in their lives ; when 
Goya painted his wonderful Third of May, 1808 
(see page 42, fig. 2), he gave the man about to be 
shot, who is kneeling, Christ's outstretched arms. 
Faith hiiving been lost, approximated after Rogier 
van der Weyden, there remains only a more or 
less complacent identification of the painter with 
Christ, or, perhaps, of his ego ideal with Christ, or 
even of the object of his mirror-love, as in VV. H. 
Hunt's obscene Shadow of Death, which might be 
excused because of its time ( 1873-74). J 

Picasso also for a time was obsessed with the 
Isenheim Crucifixion. Although he successfullv 
brought chaos and cataclysm into his 1930 panel 
on this same subject, he did so with iron) and 
even sarcasm. More interesting for our present 
concerns are the 1J)32 drawings (e.g., fig. 2), and 
the last one done on 21 August lf)38 l that led Jean 
Clair to connect Picasso's Crucifixion with a baccha 
rial, thus establishing the first link in the sequence 
leading from bacchanal to street lighting (violence, 
catastrophe, and acute pleasure). But the 1932 
drawings go further. The 1938 drawing, probabl) 
done in a fit of rage against the women who were 
then pestering him, shows Man Magdalen cling

ing to the crucified Christ's genitalia while the 
Virgin drinks the blood spurting from the lance 
wound in his side. The 1932 drawings show a 
ripped-apart body, as it is experienced in a severe 
psychotic episode, which Picasso links with early 
childhood through his drawing of L'Epingle de 
nourice [sic] (the wet-nurse's pin, that is, a safety pin) 
on which he writes the words to make the refer- 
ence clear. 7 Some catastrophe, experience of vio- 
lence, or traumatism from so long ago remains 
vivid, attached by a safety pin that can never be 
opened by the little child or later by the adult he 
is supposed to be. 

But this catastrophe has been provoked by 
curiosity, in particular by sexual curiosity, if we 
somewhat broaden the scope of "sexual." Who 
was dismembered and eaten during a bacchanal 
he was not supposed to see, if not the Pentheus of 
Euripides' tragedy, The Bacchantes? Pentheus did

not have the right to see those women and his 
mother giving themselves up to the instincts 
unleashed by the festival. He watched, was imag- 
ined to be a wild animal by his own mother (the 
Earth-Mother who gives life and takes it back), 
was torn to shreds, and partially eaten. 

This is a sort of return to the maternal belly. 
The mother, as she is seen in the living room or 
in the children's room, becomes the beast who is 
hiding with someone behind the second curtain in 
Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon (see page 44, fig. 7). After 
having stimulated such an excitement, which is 
impossible for a small child to integrate without 
experiencing a devastating shock, she emerges 
mad with anger from that lair, her staring, Medusa- 
like gaze turning the child to stone, for a long time 
and sometimes for ever. 

For one reason or another this catastrophe had 
been diluted by the young Pablo Ruiz until finally 
it encompassed all physical violence and thus also 
war. He shows this clearly in sketchbook 46 : s two 
wash drawings representing sex, but what sex! 
The man really looks as though he were not only 
raping the woman but also strangling and killing 
her. At that time the Germans were in Royan, 
sunbathing in their boxer shorts on the beaches; fat 
and pink, they pillow fought with the dead, green, 
putrescent jellyfish (meduses) that covered these 
beaches. The beaches then also were littered with 
planks from sunken ships, tobacco leaves ruined by 
salt water, and barrels of port that the local people 
were tapping, drinking right from the barrels or 
carrying the precious liquid home in pails and 
basins; in short, they were wreckers' beaches. " All 
this mess — all this war, violence, all this fear, and 
shame — all this chaos and the panic it engendered 
was, for the artist, "caused" by a childish curiosity 
so deeply buried in the unconscious that it could 
be expressed only in images.'" 

It is fairly clear that for Picasso war was a matter 
of "private mythology," as Carl Einstein put it, 
even if his work especially between 1939 and 1943 
"stinks of war."" For his work of this period stinks 
of war, or rather of the German Occupation, more 
than that of any other artist during the period 
of crisis that began, in Germany at least, as early

as 1930 and did not end, unfortunately, in 1!' !."&gt;. 

In l!)f)7 Paris saw two enlightening exhibitions 
about crisis, war, and atrocity (1930-96). 12 They 
obviously (for me) pointed out that painting is inca- 
pable of showing the horror of war in the twentieth 
century. It is completely impossible. Why? I do not 
know. Perhaps a painting requires a construction, an 
"art" (a word Picasso hated) that destroys emotion, 
at least emotion confronted with such cataclysms. 

It may be difficult for Americans even to imag- 
ine what it is like to live in one's own counti \ 
when it is occupied by an enemy like the Germans 
in World War II. To be sure, some profited from 
the situation. There were parties, full restaurants, a 
whole gai Paris that swam like fish in those waters. 
But they were in a minority. As Jean-Paul Sartre 
more or less said, life under the Occupation was 
intolerable, but somehow one got used to it. 
Sartre's opinions fluctuated during this period, 
but he lived much as did Picasso, of whom Jean 
Cocteau said, in his usual nasty way in the entry 
for 19 September 1944 of his journal (in which he 
refers mainly to society events and his little physi- 
cal ailments), "All extreme regimes, in literature 
as in politics, have adopted Picasso. It is odd, 
these days, to see him praised as l un pur de la 
Resistance' . . . Picasso has no opinion. He would 
think it unworthy of himself to have one."' 

Picasso had never seen war, not World War I, 
which the French call "The Great War," and he 
probably knew nothing about it, soldiers having 
had no desire, when they finally got a leave, to talk 
about the horror, butchery, and bloody sacrifices in 
the trenches, knowing well that no one behind the 
lines would believe them anyway. He did not expe- 
rience the Spanish Civil War, nor even, when he 
was going back and forth between Paris and Royan, 
the exodus of people terrified by memories of 
atrocities the German uhlans had committed in the 
northeastern provinces during the 1914 war. For a 
man of his generation and age, his experience of 
death was very limited. In 18!)."), he had seen his sis- 
ter Conchita dead, but had he seen her die? (Death 
is so quick and sudden in diphtheria and children 
were kept away from such scenes.) He had seen 
the painter Wiegels, his neighbor, dead at the

Bateau-Lavoir in 1908 (he hung himself). He 
had certainly seen his loved mistress ("ma jolie") 
Eva very ill in 1915, but was he there when she 
was dying in the clinic? He had seen Guillaume 
Apollinaire dead, though not dying. That same 
evening, looking into his shaving mirror, he drew a 
self-portrait" that was stricken but not despondent, 
his forehead wrinkled, his mouth set and drawn, 
and death in his eves — a sort of death mask, bill a 

J 

death mask searching for pain, misery, and emotion 
in the mirror. Guilt stifles real sadness. Picasso's rela- 
tionship with Apollinaire had been rather hectic, 
and it is important to recall that Apollinaire died of 
the "Spanish" flu, and that Picasso was superstitious. 

It seems that Picasso could feel what he called 
his "emotions" only through the intermediary of a 
mirror. It was a real mirror, in this case, but other- 
wise he discovered his feelings in the mirror of 
other peoples' eyes or faces, or at least what he 
projected there, even into those bodies at rest or 
convulsed - in short, through the intermedial \ ol 
his painting. Simplifying excessively, it could be 
said that he did not feel and had no consciousness 
of what he felt, but that through an acrobatic leap

he painted it in others. That is what Jaime Sabartes 
expresses by saying that in a portrait one can 
immediately see the mood of the artist and of the 
model at the very moment when the portrait was 
made."' Picasso told Christian Zervos that painting 
allowed him to "evacuate" an excess of emotion. " 
This can mean he must have painted what he saw 
then, but he saw through his emotion, the projection 
of his own violence: "she" sleeps all the time meant 
that he wanted to sleep and could sleep curled up 
in the maternal lap. "She" cries, "she" has fits of 
hysteria or anger, meant that he himself was suffer- 
ing and angry, and so on. 

Many men like war. Even Apollinaire, who was 
rather "feminine," could say "Ah, Dieu! que la 
guerre est jolie." 1 * Little boys play at war. Up to 
that time, in any case, it was women who hated 
war, which meant waiting, anxiety, shredding linen 
for bandages, fear for husbands, brothers, fathers, 
and sons — all experienced passively, in solitude. 
But in real life, Picasso was afraid of all physical 
violence. His own violence passed directly, without 
his becoming aware of it, into what he called paint- 
ing (which means art in general). He probably 
never even boxed anyone's ears. He complained 
but he did not hit; a little authority would probably 
have made his life, and those of others, easier, but 
his vengeance consisted in sulking; fortunately for 
him and for those around him, as well as for us 
who can see the superb paintings produced during 
his periods of crisis, his vengeance consisted in the 
violence in his painting. 

The war in Spain certainly disturbed him, but 
probably without his really feeling it: it was far 
away. The Occupation was something else to 
endure, but like Sartre, he got along somehow. 
Practically, he managed well, protected as he was 
by Andre-Louis Dubois even after he left the Surete 
nationale, Maurice Toesca, and the Spanish ambas- 
sador Lequerica. ''' He was protected by Arno Breker 
as well, and in general by the German embassy.'" 

The Germans considered Paris to be a sort of 
shop window that would demonstrate to the world 
their love for art. 21 Museums were partly reopened, 
the Paris Opera was flourishing, artists were pam- 
pered, and Picasso was the most famous of them 



all. It is said that he refused the supply of coal 
offered by the German ambassador, but his cellar 
was full of coal (of course, the studio in the rue des 
Grands-Augustins was hard to heat, but everyone 
was cold, everyone had chilblains, and Picasso 
managed to keep warm enough). He sold pictures 
(to the Germans, obviously, but he did not have to 
know that) through the intermediary of the Galerie 
Louis Carre, and through various runners; he sold 
enough to live comfortably. He took part in small 
exhibitions held in various galleries. He managed, 
probably through Breker, who admired his sculp- 
ture, to have cast in bronze the big Boisgeloup 
heads, the Death's Head (cat. no. 54), and the Cats, 
at the very moment when the Germans were 
pulling down statues all over Paris in order to melt 
them down for the bronze." 2 He was able to get 
thick beefsteaks. When he later said to someone 
that it was dangerous for him to go from the 
rue des Grands-Augustins to the Bibliotheque 
Nationale, which was ten minutes' walk away, he 
was forgetting that children were managing to go 
to school, and that the texts by Reventos that he 
said he had copied there at that time were in fact 
copied between 9 and 14 February 1947. The fat 
sketchbook known as Carnet X (dating between 
1941 and 1963) in which he copied these texts 
makes the dates clear. 

This is not to attack Picasso, but only the legends 
around him. Why should he be a hero? An artist is 
an artist; it is not the same profession. All Picasso 
wanted was not to be compromised, to go on living 
and painting peacefully. Germans came to visit 
him, which was useful for his security, but he never 
appeared with them in public. Heller, however, 
saw him at the Opera (Picasso, who hated music!), 
at a performance of Jeanne au bucher. 23 Everyone has 
seen photos of the Opera house during the war, the 
good seats entirely filled with Germans. For the 
"decent" people who experienced the Occupation 
as a kind of Lent, this may have been a little too 
much. It is true Picasso was a friend of Paul Eluard 
and Robert Desnos (on the other side of the barri- 
cade), but Eluard's Resistance was relatively theo- 
retical, certainly poetical. Desnos, who lived near 
the rue Guenegaud, just a short distance from 



84 WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? 



Picasso, and who managed with Ins wife Youki 
always to keep open house in his attic, was arrested 
in February 1944 for actual resistance. Malicious 
gossips claimed at the time that Picasso had called 
Robert an idiot; ' that having been warned, he 
should have escaped over the rooftops. (But Youki 
had gone out, and Desnos was afraid that she 
might be arrested in his stead.) In any case, Youki 
made it her business to have Contree published, a 
book for which Picasso had done an etching {Seated 
Woman, 23 December 1943; cat. no. 72). A letter 
from her dated 21 May 1944 begs Picasso to agree 
to deliver this etching, which apparently he was 
then refusing to do. Perhaps he didn't like Youki, 
but it is also likely that participating in the publica- 
tion of a book of poems by someone who had been 
deported for taking part in the Resistance would 
have been compromising at the very moment 
when the Germans, at bay, were at their most 
savage. Who knows? 

The Occupation was intolerable; people barely 
survived. Some have called it a time of purgatory, in 
the sense that in Purgatory time does not count, nor 
does hope; all is gloomy, dark, and cold. One might 
also describe this period as a long winter that lasted 
four years, in the sense that winter means that 
Nature is dead. This cold drove people into them- 
selves, into a total silence. People lived under the 
leaden lid of a stormy, icy sky. Except for bicycles 
and the Germans' big cars streets were empty, the 
intersections full of boards covered with German 
Gothic lettering. Curfew, glacial winter, and fear 
were the only items on the menu. You never knew 
what might happen to those you loved. No one 
talked. Parents forbade their children to tell their 
classmates what happened at home; silence and sus- 
picion were the watchwords. For a "mirror-being" 
like Picasso, a fearful, worried person who could 
not endure "emotion," it was, though he probably 
did not realize it, a psychological ordeal that could 
not fail to lend a certain tone to his painting. 

Those of Picasso's works done between 1939 
and 1942 are probably the most powerful, obvi- 
ouslv with some failures, but the most beautiful. It 
is interesting to note that the most eloquent, beauti 
ful, and strongest are always triggered bv an event, 



"a catastrophe." For, it he was afraid, it was 
because day after da\ he woke up in fear of a 
catastrophe thai he could not, of course, name, 
something experienced in earl) childhood and 
definitively buried. A current event, not necessaril) 
a catastrophic one, was enough to bung back to life 
the poisoned and enduring splinter. This is true loi 
many people, as one realizes il one listens to them 
with a "benevolent and evenly suspended" atten 
tion. J In Picasso's case, the catalyst was nearl) 
always either the reactions of a child who was 
present (consider the role of little Ra\ monde's 
so-called sexual curiosit\ in the evolution of the 
Demoiselles), or else the emotions of others, those 
who were close to him. 

To show this, let us move completely out of the 
overloaded period of the Occupation. It is only in 
1950-51 that this seventy-year-old man understood 
what his mother's pregnancy had meant for him 
and what was still lingering in his unconscious, as it 
would be for any child. It must be remembered 
that what we find as perfectly normal and even 
amusing today in little children was seen as a great 
sin at the end of the nineteenth century. In this 
case, the child desired the magical disappearance 
of the baby, who took up all the room when he 
was sitting on his mother's lap, and who was going 
to replace him (then he would probably be thrown 
in the trash can, replaced like a broken tov bv a 
new one). 

Although this was relived bv him through little 
Claude's crises of anxiety and concern when his 
sister Paloma was about to be born, Picasso was 
referring only to himself in his sculptures of a preg- 
nant Goat with an empty belly, a Pregnant Woman 
with an empty bellv and empty breasts made out 
of empty milk pitchers!), and especially the preg- 
nant Female Monkey with that enormous, empt) 
bellv Claude's property, because the head is made 
out of the bodies of two little cars that belonged to 
him . As much as he can, the little monkey, who 
is really a little child, clings desperately to the 
maternal lap from which he is going to be evicted, 
from which he has ahead) been evicted since 
he can no longer even put Ins arms around his 
mother's neck. This extended example attempts 



BRIOITTh BAKR 85 



to give a sense of how things worked through 
Picasso's hand and eye, if not in his head. For I am 
convinced that he had no rational consciousness 
of these feelings. 

Although at the time of the Spanish Civil War 
and the Occupation, Picasso lacked a child-mirror, 
he had another mirror, like himself somewhat 
inclined toward catastrophe: Dora Maar. Dora 
Maar reacted intensely to all the news, followed it 
closely, and belonged to a relatively well-informed 
intellectual milieu. She was, like Picasso, melan- 
cholic and high strung. He had only to watch her 
reactions to know what his were, although hers 
were stronger and dramatized. Nevertheless, it 
would not make sense to regard his terrified, terrify- 
ing, hard, nasty, cruel, spying "women of the war" 
as avatars of Dora Maar. He saw these women with 
his X-ray eyes (like Proust's) 2 * in the streets, cafes, 
and metro, through the distorting mirror of his own 
passion, anger, mistrust, hatred, and rage - that 
is, they are his projections. These women could 
express themselves, whereas he, a Latin man who 
owed it to himself to be "macho" in the good sense 
of the word, could not show his feelings. 

Strangely, this expression of personal suffering 
begins in September 1939 (in reality, as far as 
suffering per se is concerned, from 19 April 1939 
onward), and fades at the worst time in the war, 
14 July 1942, with the first version of Man with a 
Lamb. Then, in 1943, he creates many haggard 
women like the one of 6 July,-' 1 or clearly mad 
women like the one of 16 August,"' but he also 
sketches the tender, attentive mother of First Steps 
(cat. no. 67)/' who is unknown earlier, and the 
little boy who peacefully plays with his rattle-penis 
under the kind protection of a couple of 
pigeons/parents." Why? Everything is going as 
badly as it can, and yet, Picasso feels better. Is it 
that the war and the Occupation are only a climate 
or an atmosphere (to use Arletty's expression)," 
the pressure and insecurity of which exacerbate 
a purely private crisis? "Picasso has no opinion!" 
And yet his work evokes the war, the catastrophe, 
more than any other. Here we have a conundrum. 

Already in 1937, it is said, the artist was racking 
his imagination about the mural he had been 



commissioned to do for the Spanish Pavilion 
at the Paris World's Fair. And then Guernica 
happened, and the work bloomed almost overnight, 
like a moonflower. 

Picasso, a true Spaniard from Malaga, and then 
from Barcelona, was incapable of seeing the 
Basque country as Spanish. All Spaniards in the 
south detest the Basques, though it is not quite 
clear why. They are nasty, dirty, and so on, they 
say. Picasso, however, had never seen the Basque 
country. To paint Guernica, he had to think about 
the villages of his youth that he knew and loved, 
devastated by the bombardment - Horta, seen first 
on his trip to Manuel Pallares's home in 1898, and 
Gosol, visited in 1906. But the chaos he painted, 
the unimaginable, end-of-the-world turmoil, could 
only have been suggested to him by an entirely 
internalized memory of the only real cataclysm he 
had ever experienced - at the age of three, the 
earthquake in Malaga. 1 ' The horse and the bull in 
Guernica are the Spain of the corrida, not of the 
Basque country. As a child, Picasso was very sensi- 
tive, skinny, a little sickly, extremely high-strung, 
and full of imagination. A photograph made when 
he was four years old, and another when he was 
seven, show large, sad, passionate, deep eyes, 
already X-ray eyes, in a thin, pale face. 1 ' He looks 
like Proust when he was a child, a resemblance 
increased by the stiff, black shock of hair that 
covers his head like a cap. 

The Malaga earthquake recurred in his night- 
mares, for he often spoke about it to Sabartes, who 
is an extremely precious source of truth about 
Picasso (here the historicity of things is of little 
importance; the fantasies are all that count for 
human beings). From the child's point of view, the 
heaving and burning earth cracked its shell and 
projected its anger outside. In the child, the same 
rage and pressure that were almost impossible to 
express made his soul, head, and heart crack open. 
Another child was going to be born (in fact Lola, 
his sister, was born shortly after the beginning of 
the earthquake) and the earth's fire erupted to 
punish him for his anxious hatred. In short, the 
catastrophe was all his "fault." He had caused this 
immense internal and external catastrophe that 



86 WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? 



later made him shut his eyes to subsequent real cata 
strophes, which were nothing compared to that 
one. Because, all was his fault. Rage had created 
both earthquake and his own unconscious hatred 
that could kill the people he loved best. 

The other catastrophe was the one evoked by 
the Demoiselles and bv the drawings on some 
sketchbook pages" where a little toddler of about 
two, no doubt awakened by "the noise," tries to 
slip inside the curtain of "the parents 1 bedroom" to 
look. For the rest of his life this other "catastrophe" 
caused him to see embraces as veritable battles, 
hand-to-hand combat. Love and war were the 
same thing. Which one of the parents is going to 
kill the other behind the curtain? Who am I going 
to kill when I love? It would be better to drive 
them away beforehand, as it would be better not to 
fall asleep, so that the parents do not kill each other 
while one sleeps. Then, sleep late in the morning, 
while everyone else is up; sleep or daydream in 
a bed that is still somehow the maternal lap. Do 
nothing, remain rolled up against her, since that is 
what she wants, that is what will assure her of the 
perfect dependency (the safety pin) of her baby, 
who is in fact chained by the tentacles of an octo- 
pus, the octopuses that he painted and drew in the 
form of Marie-Therese, the woman he probably 
loved most. 

Obviously, all this remained totally unconscious. 
Fortunately for the child, on the night of the earth- 
quake his father carried him away wrapped in a 
shawl, held tight against him, protected from the 
fury of the earth and the boy's immense rage-guilt- 
terror. Then, in La Coruha, the father at first substi- 
tuted for the mother by taking the child to school, 
reassuring him, and coming to pick him up (the 
boy was afraid of being left at school, and like all 
children who have a fear of leaving home, he was 
afraid of another "catastrophe"; he had to keep 
watch). The father later gave him a way to achieve 
his own independence. He provided pencils, 
brushes, lessons, then teachers and good training; 
he was truly a coach, instilling professional habits 
and respect for tools in his son, and the reason 
why, later on, Picasso could sav that one had to 
master technique so fully that one could then and 



onh then forget it altogether. John Richardson says 
that Picasso, at the same time that he loved his 
lather, hated him (passim). This is arguable, as the 
father appears everywhere, such as in the i ubisl 
compositions of men at table, the sculptors of the 
Vollard Suite, and m the character of Degas in 
his late work. It was a dispassionate relationship, 
with few disagreements. ( )! course the) had a 
few conflicts as when, for example, the adolescent 
was wasting time running around at night in 
Barcelona. However, these disputes allowed the 
young artist to work through his Oedipus complex 
in anger, but also in the security of affection. 

Picasso's mother, who was very young when he 
was born, considered him, her firstborn and onl\ 
son, to be a sort of messiah, for whom she had a 
passionate, possessive but distant, almost shy, love, 
at least after his earliest infancy. She was plump a 
mark of beauty at the time), agile, vivacious, merry 
- a true Andalusian. Playing an active role in a big 
household, she probably was unable to provide 
him with the times of rest and evenly suspended 
attention that allow a baby, and then the adult that 
he is to become, to be alone-in-the-presence-of- 
someone and, so, to be able to live with other 
people as well as to be creative. s Picasso seems 
to seek this silent, restful presence/absence of the 
model in almost half the prints in the Vollard Suite, 
to cite only one example. A baby is ferocious when 
he is hungry, and later on feels quasi-sexual need, 
but he also wants calm and unintrusivc affection. 
For little Pablo, as for am small child, his mother 
must have been the very image of beauty, of ever\ 
thing a woman should be. Later, of course, she 
became rather bossy, by character and by neces- 
sity: her husband, often away, was also depressed. 

By moving to Paris, Picasso chose exile, the clas- 
sic solution for those who are too attached to then 
mothers. She wrote to him constanth , probabh to 
tell him about her life in Barcelona, since in realit\ 
they had little to say to each other, nor did she 
understand her son very well, either. These letters, 
boxes and boxes of them preserved in the- Musee 
Picasso, are not accessible to the public, even to a 
privileged public, but onl) to Picasso's heirs. Thus, 
on the bedroom wall of Mane Therese's daughtei 



URIC. I III It \l K H7 



Maya is a photocopied and enlarged extract from 
a letter dating from when Picasso was settling in 
Paris. His mother, naively, longs for the time when 
"he used to come and say goodnight to her in her 
room" after having run around town chasing girls 
until the wee hours. This comment recalls Proust's 
Narrator's good-night kiss from his mother, but 
upside-down.'" Did she ask him to tell her about his 
escapades and love affairs, in order to erase them? 
She was a "good-enough mother" but intrusive."' 
In any case, she did not let go of her son (cf. the 
"octopuses"), who loved her passionately, but often 
hated her (the one does not go without the other, 
and it is not for nothing that "passion" means 
passionate love as well as the Passion of Christ). 

Picasso, like Hermann Broch's Virgil and like 
Apollinaire, always somehow lived in what Broch, 
following the Goethe of the second part of Faust, 
called "the kingdom," "the intermediate space of 
the Mothers": "Oh! the weakness of the mother, 
who is only birth and knows nothing about re-birth, 
who doesn't want to know anything about it." 41 This 
kingdom is that of art, and poetry. But there has to 
be a father who keeps one from languishing there, 
from wallowing there in a dream, without doing 
anything, without being reborn. And Picasso had 
had the good luck to have, on and off, a good 
father, who let him develop the necessary distance 
for transforming his fascinated, voyeur's eyes into 
X-ray eyes, a seer's eyes. For a "seer" also makes 
use of projection, and even projective identification. 

In Guernica, it is his mother that Picasso "sees" in 
the form of Marie-Therese, weeping over the still- 
unborn baby of the earthquake; and then, on 1 July 
1937, he throws himself into his great Weeping 
Woman (fig. 3, cat. no. 9), which he will work 
through in seven states (the number seven was 
always magical for Picasso).'" Hieratic, tragic, digni- 
fied, she is a mater dolorosa, so typical of Spanish 
painting and sculpture, including her tears. Yes, 
Picasso told Malraux, it was Dora Maar, adding 
that he "felt" that "women are machines for suffer- 
ing."" Poor Dora Maar's tears and these "machines 
for suffering" have caused much ink to flow, espe- 
cially among feminists. However, here we have a 
hodgepodge of images: Mary Magdalen, the only 



woman described weeping at Christ's feet; the 
tale of the Italian statuette in plaster of pans that 
Picasso's father had "broken" in order to give her a 
veil, and, as tears, glass pearls, thus "Hispanicizing" 
her in the very manner that his son would later 
practice in his art; in addition, his mother had 
written him that her face was covered with soot 
and her eyes weeping and full of tears because of 
the convents and churches that were burning in 
Barcelona. 44 In the sixth state, Picasso darkened, 
"covered with soot" his Weeping Woman's face, 
then he "cleaned it up" in the seventh state, work- 
ing with his scraper on the dense drypoint lines as 
if in a mezzotint, and bringing out the modeling of 
the eyes, the cheekbones, and the tears. Picasso's 
mother had then taken vows that gave her admis- 
sion to a sort of lay sisterhood (as is done, or was, 
in Spain, among bourgeois or noble women). 
These women continued to lead secular lives but

were buried in the habits of the orders they had 
chosen. It is well known how the Republicans 
lined up skeletons of nuns in open coffins on the 
steps of the convents in Barcelona (the Spanish 
Republicans were not fond of the clergy, and for 
good reason, but went a little too far). In the panic 
of the civil war, Picasso's mother, a very old lady 
at the time, must have dreaded to imagine herself 
thus violated in her eternal repose, and she must 
have written about it to her son in a tearful letter. 
Finally, the Museo Nazionale Romano has a 
Greco-Roman head of Medusa with closed eyes 
(fig. 4), which Picasso probably never saw when he 
was there in 1917. The woman, shown in profile, 
the snakes represented by lovely wavy hair, is very 
beautiful. A close look reveals, under these eyes 
hollowed out by death, the cheek creased by tears. 
So the dying Medusa had wept like a female deer; 
at least the Greco-Roman sculptor thought so.

For him, his mother and thus all women was

last spice added to the sauce of the Weeping Woman 
is purely imaginative, but it might finish the dish. 

The two little Weeping Women of 4 Julv 1!)37 
(cat. nos. 10-11)' are already no longer dignified, 
mourning figures, but rather women in fits of Ins 
terical rage and suffering who shred their handker- 
chiefs with their teeth. It is they who we encounter 
again in the drawings after Guernica, up until 
October. The images are of Medusa, or rather the 
Erinyes, which amounts more or less to the same 
thing, except in time: one comes before, and the 
others after the murder, realized or dreamed, 
which are nearly equivalent in the guilt ot the child 
who continues to live in each of us. 

On 13 January 1939, Picasso's mother realK 
died. Very old, she still had been quite active. 
During the taking of Barcelona, which was still 
bloodier than the fighting of 1936, she was magis- 
terially directing a house full of children, including 
her own grandchildren and probablv others as 
well. Like a proper nineteenth-century Spanish 
woman, that day she was getting dressed at dawn 
behind the door of the armoire (the children all 
slept in her bedroom). She probably lost her bal- 
ance while putting on her skirt, fell, broke her 
spine, and died a few hours later. It was clearly 
impossible for Picasso to go to Barcelona. He had 
to visualize the abstract event of a distant death. 
Probably without knowing what he was doing, he 
nevertheless did it. The offspring was the Woman 
with a Tambourine, from the second half of January 
(figs. 5-6, cat. nos. 25-26)** and the two works 
entitled Woman in an Armchair, one done on 19 
April and the other a little later on an undated 
copper plate.' The physical effort required b) 
working on copper — and probably the friendl) 
atmosphere of the Lacouriere workshop - allowed 
him more easil) to "evacuate," to root out an 
anxiet) of which he probabh knew nothing 
except a sense of oppression - one might almost

say a sense of "occupation" in the sense in which 
France was "occupied." 

What is interesting in the Woman with a 
Tambourine is that she does not become beautiful 
and balanced (the woman and the composition) 
until the fifth state, or at least the fourth. The first 
state is a riddle. The figure has the upper body of a 
bacchante, but her lower body shows the unstable 
equilibrium that makes one think of the quest 
for balance in bathers and dancers by Degas. 48 
Picasso's source was a monotype reworked by 
Degas with pastel (whence, perhaps, Picasso's 
broad, furious lines grained with aquatint, which 
resemble pastel in the first state): After the Bath 1 '' 
(fig. 7). The whole lower part of the body, the 
dropped hand, the shadows, the phantom of the 
chair, the curtain, the hunched back, the shape of 
the breast in profile, and the buttocks are all there. 
Of course, the woman is reversed by printing from 
the copper plate, and moreover she is seen from 



the front and not from the back, but such emenda- 
tions are common in Picasso. If one adds to this the 
foot flattened out by the quest for balance, frequent 
in Degas's dancers, our maenad also begins by 
being, referentially, a "Woman at her Toilette," but 
one that cannot (without the support of the back of 
the chair in the Degas) keep her balance, which is 
rare for Picasso. Moreover, he persists, through 
relentless work (adding scrapings and aquatint), 
in keeping her in this crazy position for two addi- 
tional states. Then, in the fourth state, he gives up 
and borrows from Poussin, that master of balance, 
the thrown-back leg of the bacchante in his 
Bacchanal before a Herm in the National Gallery in 
London (fig. 8). Poussin's maenad functions very 
well here, the hand holding the bunch of grapes 
becoming the lowered hand in the etching, the 
flying hair corresponding to the bacchante's wild 
locks. Time had gone by, and Barcelona had per- 
haps already fallen. In any case, Picasso's bacchante 



90 WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? 



became the evocation (according to Picasso) of the 
fighting in the streets, and hand-to-hand combat. 
And yet, Degas remains: Picasso's bold stroke, 
scraping out the thrown-back leg of his figure 
crudely and furiously against the background of 
aquatint, corresponds exactly to the way in which 
Degas worked with a rag out of an inked back- 
ground on his "dark" monotypes. 

But why did Picasso persist in trying to make 
this woman, who can only fall, stand up? Certainly, 
it was, unconsciously, because of the way in which 
his mother died. " As for the bacchante, she is once 
again a young, joyous evocation of his mother, 
dancing for her fascinated firstborn son who will 
ever after be obsessed bv the fact that she had 



daiucd this dance of love/death (according to 
Picasso\ private mythology) with/for anothei pei 
son, his father, an act that "dismembered" Picasso 
psychologically, like Pentheus. Ilou much pain 
exists in all that, but what a beautiful image! 

Then there were also the two sad and smistci 
women in an armchair figs. 9-10). The first is the 
before and the other the after. The first from 1!&gt; 
April shows us a heavy woman who nonetheless 
somewhat resembles Dora Maar (always the 
Proustian mixture of two persons), sadly pensive, 
horrified b\ what is happening in the street, wor- 
ried about "the children," but keeping her feet on 
the ground, in the true sense of the word (fig. 9). 
The second, which Picasso labored over, going 
through six states, begins by being phantomlike, 
then, through scraping and burin work, takes on a 
ravaged, terrifying face (fig. 10). Her hands cling to 
the arms of the chair but her legs hang in front; she 
seems not to have anv control over her feet, which

drag on the floor, showing the soles of her shoes. 
Probably Picasso had learned or imagined that 
when his mother fell, they had carried her in an 
armchair, and she must have lost the use of her 
legs because her back was broken. "Old age and 
death," is how Picasso described the meaning of 
the chair. But additionally, the most simplistic 
interpretation of dreams assumes, rightly, that a 
woman in an armchair is a woman in the arms of 
a man. So we come back to it again, to the fantasy 
of love/struggle to the death, since this broken 
woman is dying. 

A period of not thinking about his mother's 
death followed. Picasso was very busy with 
the "total book" he and Vollard had planned, 
and political events were moving quickly. It 
is only in the relative calm of Royan that he 



begins, in September 1939, to mourn her. 

From this point of view, the first Royan sketch- 
book is extremely instructive. '" The Erinyes are 
beginning to harass the son who had, as a child, 
committed matricide in his head or at least in his 
angry heart. ' A The reason is given by the work 
alluded to in Picasso's drawing,' 4 Goya's Dream of 
Lies and Inconstancy (figs. 11-12); " the inconstancy 
and lies of the mother who returned to the father 
and who loved other children, and the inconstancy 
of the son who has led his own life and loved 
other women. There is also the inconstancy of the 
mother '' who is already the great Woman Dressing 
Her Hair of June 1940 (see page 22, fig. 8), 57 con- 
cerned only with herself and her beauty (a theme 
recurrent in Picasso), but not with her son. 

Finally, we have the cruelty and possessiveness

of the mother, who visibly intrudes, as seen in 
a series of drawings from the same Royan 
sketchbook (figs. 13-15; see also page 24, fig. 11). ' K 
It is a real, everyday, banal scene, like the one in 
Proust where Francoise kills a chicken, screaming 
"filthy beast!"'" But, why did the writer and the 
artist chose these scenes from among countless 
others? The first image is anecdotal. In the 
kitchen (buffet, radio), the maid is seated on the 
inevitable chair, her shoulders covered with a 
little crocheted shawl and a hat on her head 
(women wore hats at that time, and all during the 
Occupation). She holds on her lap, on a newspa- 
per, one of the sheep's heads, skinned but whole 
(eyes, gory ilesh, and all), that Picasso used to give 
to his Afghan hound, Kazbek. He painted these 



heads at least twice in that period, red and bloody. 

The second image is savage (fig. 14). A hand 
thrusts a cutlass into the head, which has to be t in 
up. Then the woman loses her own identity (her 
head) (see page 24, fig. 11), but she holds the 
blood-soaked sheep's head in a way that sends a 
chill down the spine - from underneath, with two 
of her fat fingers sticking out, one from the eye 
socket and the other from the mouth fig. 15 . A 
drawing of the hands alone makes clear this posi 
tion of the right hand. This woman with her "man 
tel" is at the same time a Virgin with Child and a 
Pieta holding Christ's dead bodv on her lap. It is 
a nightmarish image, which nonetheless will not 
be followed by an exact picture, 60 but rather b) 
women death's heads, women sheep's heads. In

Picasso's own case it was the mother who was 
dead, but the son, as a result, felt himself to be half- 
dead, and also, in fantasies, the roles are often 
reversed. The fingers traversing the brain and 
putting out the eye are a clear sign that as a child 
this man had felt his mother to be intruding. 

Who had killed whom in that lovemaking/ fight? 
The artist's mourning had begun - who knows 
why? - without his ever thinking about it, but with 
extreme violence. It was to endure, in its Erinyes 
phase 1,1 — and the Erinyes all became women 
painted, usually in an armchair, whether one sees 
it or not- until one finds the sheep once again, but 
alive and cuddled by a bearded shepherd-father in 
the drawings for Man with a Lamb in July 1942. It 
is the lost lamb, but found again. 62 

There are few men in the work done between 
the Garbage Man of January 1940''' and the early 
studies for Man with a Lamb (beginning 14 July 
1942). The Garbage Man seems to be a pious hope; 
he disposes of garbage, from which, however— 
Picasso's sculpture shows this— good things may be 
salvaged. As for Man with a Lamb (cat. no. 66), he is 
at once the father (he often has a beard) who saves 
the son (the Malaga earthquake), and the son to 
whom the mother has entrusted the lamb and thus 
life, the Son who is "the Resurrection and the Life,"

94 WIIKRK DO THKY COME FROM? 



in short the "rebirth" of Hermann Broch's Virgil 
Mourning, Picasso's war, is coming to an end. 

As usual, all this begins in the prints, in particu- 
lar the forgiveness — Picasso forgiving his mother, 
and forgiving also Lola, his sister, for having been 
born and for having been, in fact if not in truth, the 
child and then the adult to whom the mother paid 
the most attention, to whom she was the closest. It 
is of interest that the print that I have called, for 
lack of a better name, Paris, 14 July 1 ( &gt;42 (fig. 1(&gt;, 
cat. nos. ")7-.")8), " which is more a document than a 
marvel, shows us a whole group, a family bearing 
various kinds of food, doves, eggs, fish, and bread. 
A little girl leads a goat and a very old lad)', who 
except for her small size in no way looks like the 
artist's mother, carries a lamb rolled up in her 
shawl. They seem to be bringing all this to the 
man with flowers, bearded like the man with a 
lamb, who is wearing shorts (as Picasso often also 
did), and whose left hand supports a dish that 
resembles a palette. 

Brassai recounts that a proof of this print was 
displayed in the rue des Grands- Augustins and that 
Jaime Sabartes had told him it was the beginning of 
Man with a Lamb.' ' The man, he said, is going to take 
the lamb from the arms of the old woman and keep 
it. And in fact the first sketches for the great sculp- 
ture were made on 15 July. This was the darkest 



time in the w ar and the ( )c c upation. But l'u asso 
had more or less buried his Erinyes, .md the 
benevolent Eumenides could replace them, or 
rather, the former could be transformed into the 
latter. Perhaps he simply had rediscovered among 
his papers the photograph that was latei returned 
to the" Vilato family (into which Lola had married 
by the Musee Picasso (fig. 17).' It represents the 
artist's mother at the age of eight), visiting the 
Tibidabo fun fair around 1935-36, with the whole 
Vilato family of parents and children. The group's 
rhythm is comparable to that of the group in the 
print but without the food. The little girl in the 
photograph wears a huge straw hat but does not 
carry a plate (or a hat) full of flowers; the woman 
with the doves in the print has a mass of long hair 
that frames her face as Lola's hat frames hers, at 
the right in the photo; and (according to Xavier 
Vilato) some members of the family are more 
recognizable in that print than in the photograph, 
although disguised. From this point, the Good 
Shepherd can arrive, and as well the mother of the 
First Steps (cat. no. 67) (i.e., the print seems to be a 
source of the figure of Man with a Lamb and of a 
meaning of tenderness and generosity in First Steps). 

But before we come to that point, we must 
consider Picasso's war-women, who are sinister, 
hard, rigid, malevolent, sly, and ferocious. They

look one straight in the eyes (a raking gaze in these 
faces distorted by the paintbrush). They snigger 
cruelly. They are spies, informers, birds of prey, 
with stiff crow feathers in their hats. Picasso pro- 
jects on them almost all the bad feelings that come 
to him en masse in the first years of mourning, and 
in the mourning for a mother who was loved too 
much yet at the same time hated for making her 
little child suffer and be angry at her, mortally 
angry. He had suffered a thousand deaths and had 
hated to death. All bad memories must be expelled 
so that the good ones can finally surface —Erinyes 
and then Eumenides. 

One has only to look at these women-of-war: 
women in armchairs (real or virtual), women who 
suffer and who cause others to suffer - the hard- 
ness of the woman in a greenish yellow that sets 
teeth on edge, with her bloody lips (cat. no. 56);'' s 
the stiff, falsely resigned look of the other, gray and 
blue, with a cardboard flower in her hat, and once 
again, that bloody mouth (cat. no. 44) ; M another 
one, from 5 June 1941, who looks as though she 
had been crushed by a steamroller; " the sort of 
human beast, from 13 June 1941, all dressed up, 
with an enormous phallic nose and a ridiculous 
little hat; 71 the sinister one, all white and gray, fat, 
shapeless, with her malevolent proud smile, from 
1 August 1941. 7 ' And already, by 16 October 1939, 
a weeping woman exists with potatolike face. 71 

One might mention any number of others, 
these superb paintings of horrible and malevolent 
women, but the worst are the ones from 26 June 
and 27 July 1941 (figs. 18-19). 74 The first, who is 
squinting (cf. the leucoma on the eye of the 1903 
Celestine), looks at you with a false and gluttonous 
smile. The other, with a grotesque basket of flowers 
on her head, looks at you obliquely, out of the 
corner of her eye, ready to denounce. She is 
wickedness itself. 

Poor Picasso! No doubt he was a little bit 
paranoid during those years! But what beautiful 
paintings he made out of that real but imagined 
persecution. There is also the new version of 
Ingres's Odalisque with Slave, which had been lov- 
ingly rendered in drypoint in 1933 (Flute-player and 
Sleeping Woman 7 ), and who reappears in a jail-like

and angular guise in L'Aubade (see page 30, fig. 16), 
where we find the doubled woman, one dreaming 
and one thinking about making love (the musi- 
cian). But in this state of persecution, suffering, and 
deformation, is sex really a possibility? 

Even the magnificent Still Life with Blood Sausage 
(cat. no. 42) speaks of persecution.' 1 ' There is noth- 
ing "dead" about it except the conventional word 
in the title (nature morte). In reality, it is probably 
the only self-portrait painted during that period, 
perhaps made when thinking about the about-to- 
be-shot Christ figure in Third of May, 1808, because 
of the similarity between the triangular light that 
here escapes from the suspended bulb and the 
one that lit, triangularly, Goya's man with his out- 
stretched arms. In any case, it is an inner portrait 
of Picasso's fantasies and anxieties, which may be 
indicated by the monochromatic, grayish brown 
color scheme. But in this portrait the mother is 
a participant, so that it is more a portrait of their 
relation to each other, as was present in the psyof

the artist on 10 May 1941. The subject has nothing 
to do with shortages and restrictions. It offers, in 
wartime, a feast fit for kings, centered on a 
kitchen table. For Picasso, everything happens in 
the kitchen, the place where one lives (see The 
Charnel House, cat no. 82). These yards of rolled-up 
blood sausage are, of course, an allusion to the 
maternal belly, the sausage being a pig's intestine 
that has been washed clean, filled with blood, and 
boiled. The two artichokes allude to the hearts 
(as in "artichoke hearts") of the mother, who loved 
other people, and the son, who did not remain 
eternally faithful to his mother. The drawer with its 
knives and forks is clearly a mouth full of devour- 
ing teeth, the baby's teeth chewing on the breast. 

Who has ever thought of arranging these instru- 
ments this way in a drawer? It is contrary to simple 
good sense. The cutlass, to cut the sausage, and 
if possible the umbilical cord, is still there, not 
yet used. The wedge of camembert, a sixth of the 
whole, may allude to the prediction Max Jacob 



made to Picasso: decline at age sixty, death al sixt) 
eight (in 1941, he was precisel) si\t\ years old). 
The newspaper, moreover, i*- necessarily lull of 
bad news in 1941; it is in the obituary column that 
deaths are announced, including that of his mother, 
and soon his own. As for the bottle of white wine 
(Picasso drank only water), it contains a liquid, 
but what? Milk? Or perhaps the vinegar that was 
offered to Christ when he was thirst) ? Lastly, in 
the center of the "belly" of the roll of sausage, there 
is something bizarre, a small triangular vessel con 
taining three kinds of marbles that form something 
like an ace of clubs - the triangulation of lather, 
mother, and child, the "seeds" that we find in the 
middle of the open belly of the Small Pregnant 
Woman from 1948. 7K A superb painting, one of the 
most eloquent of this period, it is hardlv a riddle. 

From all this rubble, Picasso is going to manage, 
in 1943, to reconstitute an effigy of his mother: a 
bronze head with a hairstyle from 1900 (the little 
bun perched high up), stuck onto a dressmaker's 
wooden dummy from the era of corsets, with an 
arm and hand from the Easter Island, a gift from 
Pierre Loeb and one of the artist's treasures (cat. 
no. 73). All this is put together in such a way that 
one sees the "collage." 7 ' 1 As a joke, Picasso later put 
a painter's smock on his sculpture and attached to 
its hand a palette and brushes, showing in this way 
that if his father was indeed the manner of his 
work, it was his mother who was the inspiration, 
through The Others (women, of course). Mourning, 
and also passion, were over, and the art was 
affected by it, for the artist always did his best 
painting only when he was in a crisis, whatever 
it was. But perhaps after 1944 he was happier, 
because he was more indifferent, more cynical. 
The passion, and the Passion, were over for him. 
His war was over. He was no longer "occupied"! 
And "there was fun sometimes in Hell, wasn't 
there?" as Kipling puts it about the war in the 
trenches in 1917."

Circumventing Picasso: 
Jean Paulhan and His Artists 



Michele C. Cone 



D, 



'uring the Occupation, Georges 
Braque, Jean Fautrier, Jean Dubuffet, 
and Chaim Soutine had in common the patronage 
of Jean Paulhan (1884-1968), one of the few figures 
of the Parisian prewar intellectual community to 
remain influential during the war and for several 
years afterwards.' Paulhan (fig. 1) either wrote 
about these artists, proselytized on their behalf, 
or bought their work. Unlike the Bleu Blanc Rouge 
painters, who thought they were creating a non- 
decadent avant-garde, and the Between-the-Jew- 
and- the- Pompier contingent of romantic realists 
supported by the anti-Semitic critic Lucien Rebatet, 2 
the artists that Paulhan admired assumed their 
"decadent" vanguardism despite the prevailing 
antidecadence rhetoric in the official art press. 

Although the subject of death and decay was 
unwelcome in a country allegedly going through 
national renovation under Marshal Petain, it 
frequently appeared in the work of Paulhan's 
favorites. And, at a moment when an expressive 
matiere denoted decay, decadence, obscenity, 
and Jewishness in art, it continued to be used by 
the artists who interested Paulhan. However, with 
respect to matiere — the autonomous language of 
paint and of other materials of painting - Paulhan 



felt that his artists also parted from Picasso. 
"'[Matiere] is in Rembrandt (not in Bosch): it is in 
Soutine or Rouault ... It is in Fautrier ([but] not in 
Picasso who makes admirable colored drawings. . . .)" 
Paulhan wrote to Fautrier in 1943. ' Put in more flat- 
tering words, whereas in Picasso's wartime skulls, 
death often has the look, form, and feel of dry 
bones, death images tend to be spectral in Braque 
and Dubuffet, and viscous in Fautrier and Soutine.' 

In the context of the rampage against decadence 
by Vichyites and collaborationist critics, and of the 
reverence in which Picasso was held by enemies of 
Vichy and of the Third Reich, Paulhan's opinions 
revealed a singularly independent turn of mind. 
But then, Paulhan was used to assuming difficult 
positions. In his role as editor of the prestigious 
Nouvelle revue francaise (NRF), which he took over 
in 1925, he often had to critique the writings of 
famous authors who thought they were beyond 
reproach. He managed to remain a friend of the 
painter Andre Lhote while assailing his art. On the 
intellectual plane, Paulhan fit in with groups that 
haled each other: he was close to the surrealists in 
the early twenties and to Georges Bataille and his 
colleagues of the College de Sociologie in the late 
thirties. During the Occupation, \\v contributed to 



99 



Resistance publications while also playing artistic 
mentor to Nazi officials stationed in Paris. 

Caught in the unoccupied zone near Carcassonne 
after the invasion and partition of France, Paulhan — 
who had been associated with leftist causes — had 
difficulty obtaining a pass to return to occupied 
Paris. The negotiations with the Vichy government 
that made it possible for him to return home, like 
those which enabled so-called degenerate artists 
also caught in the unoccupied zone to return safely 
to Paris after the Armistice, remain something of a 
mystery. A French official at the prefecture, Andre- 
Louis Dubois, has taken credit for "protecting" 
Picasso during the Occupation. ' In the case of 
vanguard artists who were French nationals and 
not Jewish, the issue of degeneracy turned out to 
be more serious in the eyes of Vichyites and 
French critics than of the Nazis. "Let them degen- 
erate if they want to, all the better for us," Hitler 
told Albert Speer upon hearing that there was 
degenerate art on view at the 1943 Paris Salon 
d'Automne." Early on, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, 
a French mouthpiece for the Nazis and Paulhan's 
new colleague at the NRF, had exceptionally 
exonerated Braque from the onus of decadence 
in the cultural weekly Comoedia. 7 "Your Braque 
piece in Comoedia is excellent," was how Paulhan 
expressed gratitude to the man who made it 
possible for Braque to work in peace." 

Braque and the old-time NRF editor had met in 
1935, long after Paulhan bought his first Braque, 
a 1912 collage. The friendship intensified after the 
Armistice when Paulhan decided to write his 
thoughts on Braque for publication, and started to 
spend many hours at the artist's studio watching him 
work and hearing him talk. The first version of what 
was to become Braque le patron came out in Comoedia 
31 October 1942.' "Am I still a friend of Picasso? I 
wrote on Braque," Paulhan answered the poet Jean 
Grenier who had queried him on that subject." 1 

Meanwhile, the book with text by Paulhan 
and lithographs by Braque was taking shape at

the atelier of Fernand Mourlot: "I will always 
remember seeing Braque during the Occupation 
arrive at the atelier rue Chabrol on a prehistoric 
bicycle; he was magnificent, an impressive stature, 
with a remarkable head, pale eyes and white hair," 
recalled Mourlot in his memoirs. 11 Paulhan came 
too, to look things over and to correct Braque's 
grammar, for in the initial project the artist's 
thoughts were to be included verbatim at the 
end of the Paulhan text. 12 

Although Braque was hardly a discovery in 
1940, Paulhan befriended the famed cubist at a 
critical time in the artist's development - the start 
of a new phase of sometimes monumentally sized 
paintings depicting abruptly cut-off views of 
painterly, somewhat abstract interiors with still 
lifes - a hairbrush, washbowl, and water jug on a 
table in The Wash Stand { 1942-44; The Phillips 
Collection, Washington, D.C.); a grill, a fish, a 
platter, a large fork and sieve on a kitchen table in 
Kitchen Table with Grill (1943-44; private collection, 
Switzerland); a coal scuttle, stove, palette, waste 
basket, and heavy table in the workplace of an 
artist in The Stove (fig. 2), and sometimes the black 
silhouettes of female or male sitters such as Patience 
(1942; private collection, Geneva). Paulhan in fact

became the owner of one of the tall, narrow 
kitchen paintings and received as a gift one of 
Braque's still lifes with black, fish. He also acquired 
a sketch of an interior with two female figures. 1 In 
February 1942, Paulhan wrote to his friend the 
novelist Marcel Jouhandeau: "Yesterday [I went to] 
Braque. His latest canvases are marvelous. What 
serenity, what presence, I remain enchanted."' 
Referred to as examples of Braque's "late works" 



by the organizers of the 1997 exhibition at 
the Royal Academy in London, paintings 

by this artist dating from alter 1938 
probably influenced the works ol the Bleu 
Blanc Rouge painters, whose first group 
exhibition took place in early 1943. 

Similarities with the work of Braque are 
seen in the penchant of Edouard Pignon 
and Maurice Esteve in particular for 
somewhat abstract interiors with a plain 
still-life motif arranged on a table, the per- 
vasively silent mood, the occasional view 
out of a window with a female presence 
inside the room, and everything compressed 
within a shallow pictorial space (fig. 'A). But 
the 1943 paintings of these Bleu Blanc Rouge 
painters are more conventional in subject 
matter and in form. 

They include no bathroom parapher- 
nalia, no camouflaged "forms which have 
no literal meaning whatsoever." 1. There is

none of the "metamorphic" confusion that Braque 
said was fundamental to what he sought to express 
and that Paulhan admired in art and poetry."' 
And, they display a far less painterly matiere. 
Furthermore, the Bleu Blanc Rouge painters' use of 
mostly primary colors gives their paintings cheerful 
connotations totally at odds with Braque's more 
muted palette. Indeed, as pointed out by John 
Golding, "whereas the earlier paintings [of Braque] 
were characterized by an air of serenity and a 
quiet, restrained splendour, [his] wartime pictures 
tend to be austere, at times even tragic in their 
implications." 17 

In conveying confinement, the cold of unheated 
interiors in the winter, the heightened importance 
of food, and also in a recourse to a palette domi- 
nated by grays, black, dark blues, and browns, 
paintings by Braque are closer to Picasso's output 
during the same years than to the Bleu Blanc Rouge 
painters. But in the treatment of the death image, 
Braque and Picasso part ways. Like Picasso, Braque 
painted a number of skulls during the Occupation 
years, but he later denied their symbolic connota- 
tions, insisting to John Richardson that what 
fascinated him in painting a skull next to a rosary 
was "the tactile quality of the rosary and the 
formal problems of mass and composition posed 
by the skull." 18 

There is indeed a striking difference in the skull 
image by Braque and by Picasso. For one thing, 
Braque did not make skull sculptures, but only

paintings where a skull form is present. For another, 
Braque's painted skulls are far less assertive than 
Picasso's; they glance to the side rather than con- 
front the viewer directly, and they have a ghostly, 
evanescent quality, not the dry and bony texture of 
skeletons (figs. 4-5). And most telling, when seen 
in profile, a palette image can transmute into both 
a skull and an amoeba (The Stove; Large Interior with 
Palette [1942; The Menil Collection, Houston]; 
Still Life with Palette [1943; The Saint Louis Art 
Museum]). Thus, rather than expressing fear of 
the finality of death or insisting on a dichotomy 
between death and life, these works suggest that 
there might be a continuum between the end and 
the beginning of life. 

Paulhan, who favored Braque's matiere over 
Picasso's and who liked Braque far more than he 
did Picasso (Paulhan and Braque apparently shared 
an interest in Tibetan Buddhism), wrote of his pref- 
erence from the point of view of a Frenchman who 
believes in national characteristics. He appreciated 
Braque's lack of brashness and attributed to him a 
typically French understanding of the materials of 
his craft: "Picasso makes so much noise that one 
loves Braque first for his discretion, then for his 
silence, and finally because one imagines that he 
knows so much more than the other . . . ," he wrote 
Jouhandeau in 1932, three years before meeting 
Braque in person. 1 ' 1 He reiterated his preference to 
Jouhandeau in 1939: "The Braques are remarkable 
... It greatly surpasses Picasso ... I think that what 
I like in him [Braque] ... is the patience, the fine 
touch of the French artisan . . . One is never more 
keenly aware of the Cocteau side of Picasso than in 
front of a Braque.""' 

In 1943, the Galerie de France offered an apercu 
of Braque's early works, soon after which twenty- 
two recent paintings and nine pieces of sculpture 
were featured at the 1943 Salon d'Automne. While 
the Je suis partout critic, Lucien Rebatet, sneered at 
"the resurgence of an old world that clings to the 
debris of its past, both anarchical and academic," 2 
positive reports on visits to the artist's studio filled 
the pages of the more moderate cultural weekly 
Comoedia. From Marguerite Bouvier we learn that 
Braque was a fanatic of the Greek author Hesiod.

From the painter Jean Bazaine (one of the Bleu 
Blanc Rouge painters) we hear that Braque liked 
comparing himself to a gardener among his trees: 
"I prune, I clip, I command."" Braque emerged 
from the war untainted, although he confided to 
the printmaker Mourlot that he might have gone 
on the propaganda trip organized for French artists 
by the Nazis "had they liked his paintings."- 

Overall, the Paris to which Braque and many 
other artists returned after the Armistice had a very 
strange atmosphere. No exhibition could open 
without first being visited by a Nazi censor. In 
galleries and in museums, art by Jewish artists was 
kept definitelv out of sight. The surrealists were 



rarely on display, cither. New names 
signed the columns of an ar\ ani/.ed ai i 
press, and at the Nouvelle revue francaise, 
Paulhan had to share power with the 
pro-Nazi appointee, Drieu la Rochelle. 
The gallery scene was also transformed. 
Paul Rosenberg, whose gallery had rep 
resented Braque, had left for the United 
States. Galleries owned by Jews were 
aryanized - handed over to collabora- 
tionist owners, or fictitiously sold so 
that the true owners could remain silent 
partners. Galerie Louise Leiris owned 
by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler was in 
that category, as was the Galerie Rene 
Drouin owned by Leo Castelli. ' 

It was at Galerie Drouin that Jean 
Fautrier was launched in October- 
November 1943. "I convinced Rene 
Drouin to give Fautrier a major exhi- 
bition," Paulhan wrote to a friend on 
29 September 1943. "He [Drouin) has, 
on place Vendome, the most beautiful 
gallery in all of Paris." 25 Paulhan 
took many friends on studio visits to 
Fautrier's atelier at 2 Hi, boulevard 
Raspail, including resisters and collabo- 
rators, pro- and anti-Semites, and even 
the Nazi official, Gerhard Heller, who 
would remember Paulhan as "my 
mentor in modern art."' Paulhan wrote 
the catalogue essay for the 1943 Drouin 
exhibition, the first version of a longer text entitled 
Fautrier I'enrage. 11 He also published an article on 
the artist in Comoedia (13 November 1943). 

To this day, Fautrier (1898-1964) is best 
known for his Hostage series of paintings started 
in 1943 and exhibited in 1945, which unveiled 
a new process — the building up of a tactile 
relief on which the artist could then draw or 
paint, a new vision anticipating iart informel/* 
and a resonant subject matter - the routine Nazi 
roundup and killing of hostages in retaliation 
for the assassination of one of their men. 
(For a while, fearing arrest, Fautrier lived in 
hiding at Chatenay-Malabry outside Paris,

within earshot of woods where the Nazis came 
to finish off their victims by gunshot.) 

This view of Fautrier's career — revised by a ret- 
rospective exhibition at the Musee d'Art Moderne 
de la Ville de Paris in 1989 - obliterates some 
twenty years of his painting production prior to 
1943 and omits the important exhibitions of his art 
at Galerie Visconti in 1924, at Georges Bernheim 
in 1928, and at the NRF gallery in 1934. The war- 
time Drouin retrospective showed both old and 
new work by an artist then in transition. 

Among the early paintings on view were two 
still lifes of a decomposing boar, and Rabbit Skins 
(fig. 6), 29 a luminous painting showing five dead 
hares dangling in graceful abandon from the end of 
a string in a dark, cavelike space. A delicate, some- 
times furry texture and soft contours predominate, 
not only in black-on-black still lifes of dead animals 



from the mid-twenties, but also in mostly black 
paintings like Black Flowers (1926; Limmer 
Gallery, Freiburg), Still Life with Pear (1928; 
private collection, Germany), and Nude (1926; 
Limmer Gallery, Freiburg). Like Soutine, whom 
it is tempting to compare to the Fautrier of Rabbit 
Skins, the French-born artist had stayed away 
from the whole episode of cubism. Indeed, his 
late twenties and early thirties demoiselles ( Young 
Women [1929; Marie-Jose Lefort Collection, 
London]) had more to do with "precultural repre- 
sentation" ,(l than with the cubist distortions of 
Picasso's Demoiselles a" Avignon (see page 44, fig. 7). 
Present in the Drouin selection was the painting 
that began Paulhan's Fautrier binge, Open Corpse 
(fig. 7), a human body in frontal view, open as for 
an autopsy, its guts a zigzagging line within a dark 




104 CIRCUMVENTING PICASSO 



oval. "This cadaver that has just been broken 
open for an autopsy, resembles some marching 
condottiere," " Paulhan remarked, discovering in 
an ambiguous overlay of two states of being the 
sense of metamorphosis that he also valued in 
Braque's late works. Paulhan, who had seen death 
closely during World War I and become fascinated 
with morbid images, hung Open Corpse in the 
dining room of the home on rue des Arenes that 
he shared with his wife, and to which he brought 
his writer friends. 

The list of works for the Galerie Drouin show 
indicated a hiatus in Fautrier's production between 
1932 and 1938 (when the artist left Paris and 
became a nightclub owner and instructor in a ski 
resort), and a reprise in 1938 of fruit and (lower 
paintings, still black with blurred contours, such as 
Fruit in a Bowl and Flowers (1939; Michael Werner 
Gallery, Cologne). In 1940-41, Fautrier was going 
to give up oil and canvas, as he began to layer 
absorbent paper mixed with paste in lieu of a 
simple prepared canvas base/' In The Rabbit (1941; 
Limmer Gallery, Freiburg) and The Fish (1943; 
private collection, Paris) — two works that have 
been traced back to the Galerie Drouin 19 13 
retrospective" — contrasts of light and dark are 
disconnected from the outlined skeleton of the 
depicted objects. Graffiti like, gestural short 
markings identify the subject matter. The catalogue 
list also included several landscapes from 1943 as 
well as two paintings of heads dated 1943. In 
addition, it showed five pieces of sculpture 
(including four heads from 1942-43), a number 
of unidentified drawings from 1942-43, and three 
sets of book illustrations. 

It would thus appear that a number of works in 
the style of the Hostage paintings might have been 
seen in the 1943 exhibition, though - no doubt for 
safety reasons - none bore a title that risked 
offending the Nazi censors. More intriguing than 
the subject matter at that point was the change in 
surface quality from fiat to impastoed, as if a frag- 
ment of Soutine's raised and heavily textured sur- 
faces were being analyzed in close-up view (fig. 8). 

Fautrier not only exhibited art that was flagrantly 
"decadent" bv the standards of his enemies, he 



illustrated the poems of Resistance- friends, and 
helped a Jewish artist survive. A lettei from 

Paulhan - who had taken an interest in a Jewish 
painter named Bcnn [Rabinowicz] - reveals that 
in 1943 Fautrier spent 3,000 francs for a work by 
Benn. ' Soon after this letter Paulhan thanked 
Fautrier for a precious gift. "I don't think that our 
friends in [internment?] camps could have received 
anything better or more nourishing. " 

Not surprisingly, Fautrier's exhibition aroused 
the passion of Lucien Rebatet, the pro Nazi critic 
ol/e suis par tout: "If you want an apercu of dementia 
praecox, go see [Fautrier's] mauve or yellow land 
scapes, his pink apples . . . These kilos of paint . . . 
What debauchery, for Gods sake! What a waste of 
canvas which could have been more usefully 
employed for making sheets or baby diapers."' 
Rebatet favored watercolor, the medium most 
antithetical to Fautrier's raised impastoed surface, 
and, among contemporary watercolorists, praised 
romantic realists Roland Oudot and Maurice

Brianchon, whose Between-the-Jew-and-the-Pompier 
aesthetics combined escapist themes, refined taste, 
harmony and moderation, and a Bonnardian light- 
ness of touch (fig. 9). 

At a time when thick painterly mature was 
abhorred by all major French critics as un-French, 
degenerate, and, in the words of Jean-Marc 
Campagne, the critic at Les Nouveaux Temps, typical 
of Jewish art, 17 Fautrier's use of it daringly flaunted 
the acceptable. In inventing an original way to 
address artistic and racial issues, Fautrier was 
exceptional among French artists. And, in pushing 
the issue of matiere beyond Soutine's viscous 
surfaces, he was making visible the link between 
Soutine and postwar art informed* 

Although Fautrier and Soutine were near con- 
temporaries (Soutine was born in 1893 and 
Fautrier in 1898), may have lived at La Ruche 
during the same years, and while the dealer Paul 
Guillaume bought paintings by the two of them, 39 
no evidence exists that they knew each other. 
A portrait by Fautrier of Soutine's first dealer, 
Leopold Zborowski, is the sole evidence of a pos- 
sible personal link/" Furthermore, everything in 
their backgrounds and personalities would have 
separated them. Soutine's father was a poor Jewish 
clothes mender in a small Lithuanian village from 
which young Chaim had run away in order to 
pursue his goal of becoming an artist. Fautrier had 
a wealthy French mother who uprooted her son to

London art schools. One was short and pudgy, the 
other a natural athlete. 

In a well-known photograph, Fautrier displays 
the ascetic face of Marcel Duchamp, distorted by 
an Antonin Artaud grimace. Sensual lips on a 
chubby face characterize Soutine's physiognomy 
in a 1938 photo portrait. "Handsome, elegant, 
nervous, he startled, intimidated, fascinated, was 
either adored or hated, yet felt forever alone on his 
mountains," is how one female admirer remem- 
bered Fautrier." For her part, Soutine's companion 
in the late thirties, Gerda Groth, better known as 
Mile Garde, 12 found Soutine singularly lacking in 
seduction. He was also, she discovered, incapable 
of creating a particular atmosphere around him.

as if he were provisionally camping there." 4J 

Yet far apart as they might be, they shared a 
strange ambivalence - attraction and repulsion - 
toward decaying flesh and viscous matter that was 
totally foreign to Picasso's fear of death syndrome 
and images of dry, bony skulls. Something in their 
past experience — memory of the shtetl for one, 
trench life in World War I for the other - seemed 
to have familiarized them with gory sights to such 
an extent that they could contemplate death from 
a perversely formal viewpoint. Indeed, Fautrier's 
most powerful works — both his early represen- 
tations of the dead hare, dead boar, and human 
corpse, and his World War II Hostage images — 
bring to mind Elie Faure writing of Soutine's 
Carcass of Beef of 1928: "It is in dead flesh that he 
finds his most erotic pleasures." 44 

Paulhan was himself very much aware of a 
Fautrier/ Soutine connection. Explaining his initial 
reticence toward Fautrier to the critic Marcel 
Arland, he wrote to him in 1941: "I never slighted 
Fautrier. At the same time, I found him estimable, 
brilliant — and yet he did not interest me very 
much. I said to myself: he is obviously gifted and 
what else? Neither the ardor of Soutine, nor the 
faith of Rouault."*' The Soutine reference remained 
in the foreground even after Paulhan overcame his 
doubts about Fautrier. In a letter of 28 June 1943 
written to Marcel Jouhandeau, he said, "I would 
like some day to take you to Fautrier. I don't think 



106 CIRCUMVENTING PICASSO 



that, other than [Andre] Masson (and maybe 
Soutine), there is a greater painter today." 41 And 
to his friend Henri Pourrat, in a letter of 24 August 
1943, he noted, "He [Fautrier] is with Soutine the 
greatest of painters among the young: a thousand 
feet above [Roland] Oudot, [Maurice] Brianchon 
and the others."' 

In fact, Paulhan coveted owning a Soutine long 
before he went on his Fautrier binge, and it is 
likely that Paulhan turned to Fautrier's strangely 
morbid paintings in part because of their affinity 
with Soutine's sensibility. "I have often dreamt 
about [owning] a Soutine," he wrote to the para- 
plegic poet Joe Bousquet, a conduit to the surre- 
alists and to Jewish artists during the war, asking 
him to find one or two works by Soutine "at 15 no 
more than 20, 000 francs."" We do not know if 
Paulhan's wishes were fulfilled at that time, and if 
so, what painting or paintings Paulhan bought. 
What we do know is that with the exception of

Maternity (1942; Madeleine Castaing Colle&lt; lion. 
Paris), showing a seated mother holding the limp 
body of a child on her lap, "in his last phase, tin 
years of Vichy France, Soutine's focusing image 
was not death, dving or the depiction of life," as 
Maurice Tuchman has pointed out in his recent 
contribution to the Soutine catalogue iaisonne." 

The last paintings, although steeped in the 
French countryside and in the observation of 
French country people, evoke the artist's nostalgia 
for another place and time, as if the roots he had so 
diligently repressed had surged back to the surface. 
Mile Garde was a witness to this change: "One 
day, watching me cry, Soutine asked me the 
reason. I told him I was nostalgic for my parents, 
and I added, 'How can you not think about yours 
without sadness? 1 He immediately wrote a letter to 
Lithuania and awaited an answer every da\." 

It might well be the world of Soutine's youth 
that he depicts in Maternity, in the portrait of 
a little girl in a pensive pose leaning on a bal- 
ustrade entitled Young Girl at Fence (fig. 10), in 
Therese by the River (ca. 1942; private collection, 
Paris), in Grandmother and Child (ca. 1943; private 
collection), showing a white-haired older woman 
dressed in black who smiles at the child holding 
her hand - paintings with the quality of Proust- 
ian memory. They look as if Soutine had posed 
French models but painted them as characters 
from the shtetl. Even Return from School after the 
Storm (fig. 11), with its dark blue-green trees 
rising in an empty plain and children shuffling 
along a dirt path, speaks of walks through 
windblown Russian steppes rather than the 
French countryside. 

The nostalgia present in Soutine's last paintings 
- the distant memory of friendly faces and familiar 
sights - is hardly surprising. The small village in 
occupied France where he stayed in hiding during 
the war could easilv merge in his mind and in his 
art with the village in distant Lithuania where he 
was born and raised. Furthermore, the persecution 
of Jews in his countrv of adoption, occupied 
Prance, could well remind him of His early 
encounter with racial persecution m his native 
village in Lithuania.

Indeed, no sooner was the Armistice signed by 
Marshal Petain in June 1940 than the first anti- 
Jewish measures were instituted. More and more 
ignominious obstructions were put in place in the 
occupied zone, affecting the daily life of Jews, both 
foreign and French ones. On an early morning in 
July 1942, the Velodrome d'Hiver roundup took 
place. Thousands of Jews were awakened by the 
French police, told to take a few personal things, 
and put on buses headed for the Vel d'Hiv sports 
stadium. After a few nights and days spent at the 
open stadium, most of them were transferred to 
the Drancy internment camp outside Paris, the 
antechamber of Auschwitz.' 1 As of June 1942, 
Jews were forced to wear the yellow star to make 
them more easily identifiable for arrest. 52 Routine 
roundups took place, in the course of which men 
were asked to lower their trousers for signs of 
circumcision, then taken away. 

Aged forty-six in 1939, Soutine was at the peak 
of his career, the years of starvation in Montparnasse 
behind him. He lived comfortably in the Villa 
Seurat (some claiming that he was sympathetic to 
the right-wing Action francaise), his medical and

emotional problems were attended to by his devoted 
companion, Mile Garde, and his ego nurtured by 
Madeleine Castaing, his major collector at that 
point. Suddenly his foreignness and then his Jewish- 
ness boomeranged back at him, transforming his 
everyday life into a permanent nightmare. In Sep- 
tember 1939, when the war broke out, he was at 
Civry near Avallon with Mile Garde, visiting an 
art dealer. As Soutine was a Russian and Garde 
a German national, they were told by French offi- 
cials — the then-French government feared the 
presence of traitors among foreigners - that they 
could not return to Paris, and must remain at Civry 
in residence surveillee. They escaped and went back 
to Soutine's atelier in Paris. 

In May 1940, when German nationals were 
isolated from the rest of the population, again as 
potential traitors — Mile Garde was sent to Gurs, 
the ignominious internment camp in the Pyrenees 
that, under the Vichy government, became a way 
station for Auschwitz. (Among the lucky ones, she 
was not deported, but never saw Soutine again.) 
In a panic after her disappearance, Soutine turned 
to Madeleine Castaing. From the June Armistice 
signed by Marshal Petain's anti-Semitic government 
until his transport to the Junot hospital in Paris 
in August 1943, Soutine stayed in hiding around 
the village of Champigny — in the care of a new 
companion, Marie-Berthe Aurenche (Max Ernst's 
former mistress). 

When hardly anyone dared to mention his 
name, much less buy his work, the Castaings 
continued to collect it to the very end of his life.' 3 
On 9 August 1943, he died during an operation 
for his stomach ulcers. Mile Garde, by then living 
in hiding in Paris, reported, "Two days later, I 
followed the funeral to Montparnasse Cemetery. 
There were very few people, for most of Soutine's 
friends, and the painters of Montparnasse, had to 
remain in hiding. However, Jean Cocteau, Picasso, 
and Michonz followed the funeral procession."' 

Paulhan never established a personal relationship 
with Soutine the way he did with Braque, Fautrier, 
andjean Dubuffet, explaining to Bousquet that "I 
could have met him but there was a time when I 
found it more proper not to see the painters that the 



108 CIRCUMVENTING PICASSO 



NRF talked about. It was a bit stupid." Paulhan's 
meeting with Dubuffet occurred in the last months 
of the Occupation, when the outcome of the war 
in favor of the Allies seemed assured. "I have 
discovered another brilliant painter whose name 
is Dubuffet; in a minuscule atelier on the rue 
Lhomond he paints puppets, and metro scenes. 
Otherwise, wine merchant (wholesale) and friend 
of [Georges] Limbour," he wrote to Jouhandeau 
in March 1944. * 

Born in 1901, and slightly younger than Fautrier 
and Soutinc, Dubuffet belonged with their gener- 
ation. Like Fautrier, Dubuffet had given up 
painting during the thirties for a more lucrative 
activity. He resumed his vocation in 1942, "resolved 
to devote two or three years (with enough money 
to live on for that length of time) to making paint- 
ings for my own use and without worrying about 
whether or not they were susceptible to being 
approved by anybody"'

From an exhibition of children's drawings al Musee Galliera, 

Paris, ]'•!_' Dimensions unknown, Present location unknown 



As with Fautrier, more attention has been paid 
to Dubuffet's postwar art in relation to /'ail infbmul 
than to the work that came before. Overlooked 
in particular are the Mav June 1!&gt;1 1 "messages" 
scribbled in an awkward hand on mess\ news 
paper print, which simulated the anon) mous 
graffiti used by lovers, the deranged, and resisters 
to communicate. Sentences like "The ke) is undei 
the shutter," "I think of you," "Thank you very 
much my health is excellent," "Georges arrives 
tomorrow morning," "Fmile has left," are also rem- 
iniscent of messages scribbled in prison or heard 
over the BBC radio during the war. 

Typical of the Vichy years are also colorful oil 
paintings and drawings based on children's art, 
made at a time when the art of children was much 
celebrated and even shown in museums. But 
whereas the children's drawings on view at the 
Paris Musee Galliera paid homage to Marshal 
Petain (fig. 12), Dubuffet's works concentrated 
on scenes of the wartime everyday, filled with 
expressive, toylike figures. In these works, 
sad-looking people stand in a crowded subway 
car (fig. 13), go about their business on foot on 
a city street, play jazz, bicycle on an open road, 
and milk cows. All these "puppets from the 
city and the country" (the title of the series) - 
Hoffmanesque automatons - operated in the odd 
terrain of plastic naivete overlaid with mature 
emotion. Dubuffet noted that 

/ liked the kind of painting that children make, and 
aimed at nothing more than to make equivalent ones, 
for my sole pleasure. I believed that paintings 
deprived of technique like those made by children, 
effortlessly and quickly, can be as effective, even more 
effective than paintings produced in the cultural 
circuit, and that they can also be carriers of unex- 
pected bonuses offering novel overtures to thought. ' 

( )ne such painting, View of Paris: Everyone at the 
Windows (fig. 14), depicted an old building facade 
with little white stick figures standing on the 
window sills, the arched windows suggesting 
an alignment of tombstones. Made the day aftei 
the poet Max Jacob's memorial, it was given to

Paulhan. (Both Dubuffet and Paulhan had been 
friends of the dead poet.) According to the artist, 
it was inspired by "the wall of ghosts that surged 
in [my] mind during the ceremony"' 1 that he and 
Paulhan had attended. 

Rene Drouin, at the urging of Paulhan, included 
Dubuffet in two group exhibits at his gallery - The 
Nude in May 1944 (with Seated Woman in Front of 
Blinds [May 1943; C. Renault Collection, Paris]) and 
Twenty -One Landscapes m]v\y 1944 (with Grassy and 
Earthy Landscape [February 1944; private collection, 
Zurich]). The critic Georges Limbour, a longtime 
friend, expressed his admiration in the soon-to- 
become-defunct Comoedia on 8 July 1944. The 
critic Gaston Diehl, who had championed the Bleu 
Blanc Rouge painters and might have responded 
positively to the cheerful look if not the less than 
cheerful content of Dubuffet's works, called his 
art "a dangerous joke"("une facetie dangereuse") in 



the about-to-disappear newspaper Aujourd'hui on 
17 July 1944. This comment was not going to deter 
Drouin from giving Dubuffet a one-man show at 
his gallery in October 1944, for which Paulhan 
wrote the catalogue introduction in the form of a 
letter to the artist. 

One might well ask what criteria allowed 
Paulhan, the famed editor and discoverer of liter- 
ary talent, to switch so easily from new authors to 
new artists. As the critic Andre Berne-Joffroy con- 
ceded, "One cannot forget that his strange lucidity 

— so suddenly displayed in the realm of painting 
soon after 1940 — was sustained by the very same 
qualities he had cultivated with extraordinary care in 
literature ... on the basis, it is true, of exceptional 
talent."'" Indeed, his beginnings as an art "critic" 
coincided with the publication in 1941 of Les Fleurs 
de Tarbes, a summation of his views after fifteen 
years as arbiter of contemporary literature and 
poetry in Paris. 

In this pessimistic and disorienting text — offered 
as a series of glimpses rather than a demonstration 

— creativity is shown to be at a near impasse. 
Everything has been said "and in the end every 
word becomes suspect if it has been used before."" 1 
What is left to explore is the very matiere of 
language, its texture dissociated from sentences, 
from words, and even from letters. 12 Paulhan's 
commitment to matiere in painting would seem to 
have derived from the priority that he assigned to 
matiere in literature. But no sooner had he laid 
down his demand for a literature de la matiere (that 
would be obviously incomprehensible) than he 
declared the cliche, the banal, the lieu commun - 
which he intuitively disliked — to be a necessity 
of literature if language were to recover both its 
adhesion to the world and its communicability. 

The idea of the commonplace also partook of 
his judgments on art, as when he said of Braque 
in Braque le patron that 

What I meant to say also is that Braque s painting 
is banal. No doubt fantastic but ordinary. Fantastic 
- when one thinks about it - as it is to have one 
nose and two eyes, and the nose precisely between the 
two eyes. 63 



110 CIRCUMVENTING PICASSO 



Asjohn Culbert pointed out with regard to 
Paulhan's writings, "one of the dominant traits of 
Paulhan's work is the refusal to settle differences."" 
In order to interest Paulhan the critic, a work - 
whether of literature or of art - must waver on the 
cusp of the accessibly seductive and the repulsively 
difficult, always risking failure like a high-wire 
act. It was thus hardly surprising to read Paulhan 
saying of Fautrier's wartime painting that it was 
very close to insult and to filth.' 

But Paulhan did not suddenly become an 
authority on new art. He himself had mentors. One 
of them was Henri Michaux, the Belgian surrealist 
poet/painter and contributor to NRF who had 
"long tried to interest Paulhan in a new possible 
orientation in painting."'' Michaux had traveled to 
the Far East and become fascinated by Tibetan 
Buddhism. The Buddhist view of dying as a process 
of metamorphosis between two states of being, 
which Paulhan mav have discovered himself when 

J 

he lived in Madagascar from 1908 to 1910, probably 
influenced his fearless affinity for morbid images 
as much as death's routine presence at the front 
lines during World War I had when he fought with 
the Zouaves. But more important was Michaux's 
discovery in China of a new approach to making 
art: "[I]n Chinese painting, images are there and 
yet they're absent. Like delicate phantoms that 
haven't been summoned by desire."'" In Michaux's 



description, we recognize traits that applied to 
the art that Paulhan admired. 

This being said, at a time when the romantic 
realists Oudot and Brianchon were being cele- 
brated in the pages of the Fascist sheet _/&lt;? suis 
par/out, and the Bleu Blanc Rouge painters Jean 
Bazaine, Fdouard Pignon, Andre Fougeron, 
Maurice Esteve, and Alfred Manessier were 
claiming attention as the new French vanguard, 
Paulhan's support of Fautrier, Dubuffet, and 
Soutine showed unusual courage. Small wonder 
Rebatet called him "an Aryan ashamed of his 
foreskin and of his baptism" in the pages of 
Je suis partout. 1 * And yet, considering his support 
of Braque and circumventing of Picasso, who was 
as engaged against fascism as he was, Paulhan's 
choices seem to have been more personal than 
ideologically motivated.

Reports from the Home Fronts: 
Some Skirmishes over 
Picasso's Reputation 



Michael FitzGerald 



A 



xcounts of life in Paris following the 
Liberation sometimes give the impression 
that Picasso ranked with the Louvre as a symbol of 
French culture. Magazine and newspaper reporters 
who had followed the Allied invasion across 
France and were experienced hands at delivering 
breaking accounts of the latest military assaults 
suddenly focused their skills on this single artist, 
a sixty-four-year-old man who wasn't a French 
citizen and had received no official recognition 
from the nation's cultural establishment. The war 
correspondent for the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter 
D. Whitney, filed one of the first celebrations. 
Under a boldface headline, "Picasso Is Safe," the 
article proclaimed the artist "the world's greatest 
painter" and proceeded to print Picasso's account 
of the Occupation. 1 

Nor was this phenomenon limited to journalists, 
whose attention might be explained by a desire for 
an assignment that did not require dodging mortar 
shells, diving into muddy foxholes, or sleeping 
on rocky ground. Picasso's studio on the rue des 
Grands-Augustins became such a popular desti 
nation for furloughed GIs that Thursday mornings 
were set aside for men and women in uniform to 
see where Picasso lived and to have the chance to 



examine a few of the many paintings he had made 
during the years of isolation (fig. 1). Picasso bantered 
about these sessions with his friend, the photog- 
rapher Brassai, "Yes, it's an invasion! Paris is 
liberated, but me, I was and I remain besieged." 

Unlike earlier phases of his career, this round of 
celebrity was not sparked by controversy over his 
most recent work. Except for a small number of 
pictures that may have hung unceremoniously 
in a few Parisian galleries or in a friend's home, 
Picasso's wartime art was hardly seen outside his 
studio until the Salon d'Automne opened in 
October. Even then, the paintings themselves 
prompted less debate than did the political implica- 
tions of his recent affiliation with the Communist 
Party and longstanding animosity over his repudi- 
ation of academic standards. As Picasso explained 
to Whitney, "I have not painted the war because I 
am not the kind of a painter who goes out like a 
photographer for something to depict. But I have 
no doubt that the war is in these paintings I have 
done. Later on perhaps the historians will find 
them and show that m\ st\ le changed under the 
war's influence." Nonetheless, the Chronicle's 
editors chose the phrase "War in his art" to run 
boldface under a photograph of the artist.

While other essays in this volume will take 
Picasso's suggestion and explore the often subtle 
ways in which the experience of the war may 
be reflected in the art, this essay examines the 
development of his public reputation, from the 
beginning of the war to its conclusion, through 
published commentary, trade in art, and exhibi- 
tions in galleries and museums. Disconnecting 
Picasso's art from contemporaneous discussions 
and presentations affecting his reputation seems 
appropriate, because the war largely cut off both 
the artist and his work from interested audiences. 
Despite the near blackout, controversies over his 
art continued, in part fed by rumors. And, in the 
absence of significant new information, events that 
occurred immediately before and after the war — 
rather than activities during the Occupation — 
shaped the argument. While generated by the 
exceptional conditions of that time, the "disem- 
bodiment" created between the artist and his 
public image was far from unique. It represents a 
problem that increasingly has confronted artists 
and other public figures of this century, as the pro- 
fessions of journalism and public relations have

separated individual and image to satisfy bur- 
geoning popular fascination with celebrity. 

Preceding the war, two crucial events occurred 
in Picasso's career — the international tour of 
Guernica and the retrospective exhibition organized 
by the Museum of Modern Art. After first pre- 
senting Guernica (pages 40-41, fig. 1) in the Spanish 
Pavilion of the Paris World's Fair in 1937, Picasso 
allowed the mural to travel to London and the 
United States as a fundraising promotion for 
the Republicans (fig. 2). 3 It arrived in London 
in October 1938 and New York in May 1939, 
followed by appearances in many cities across 
America. Perhaps even more than the initial 
presentation in Paris, these showings highlighted 
the political content of the painting and Picasso's 
willingness for it to be used for propaganda. This 
emphasis intensified as the months passed and the 
Nazis' military campaigns expanded from Spain 
to Czechoslovakia and Poland. 

In New York during summer 1939, Guernica 
certainly struck prominent critics as more than a 
statement about events in Picasso's homeland, by 
then already two years in the past. Henry McBride, 
a longtime defender of the avant-garde, wrote that 
"we shall regard Guernica as the most concrete and 
powerful statement of the hatreds generated by 
these political wars of the present.'" Elizabeth 
McCausland, a critic deeply committed to political 
action as well as to Picasso's art, saw the painting 
not only as an unequivocal statement of his public 
opposition to Franco, but also as a rejuvenation 
of his art after he had, in the previous few years, 
"arrived at the nadir of personal revolt and 
spiritual defiance." ' 

This shift of focus from Picasso as an extreme 
individualist and aesthetic innovator to an artist 
of deep political commitment carried into 
the Modern's retrospective, which opened in 
September 1939, the first month of the European 
war. In February, Time had already set the stage, 
passing from describing Picasso as possessing 
"probably the greatest painting virtuosity in the 
world" to highlighting his response to the civil war. 
"The two works which have put him in the news 
since 1936 have been public, polemical jobs: his 



114 REPORTS FROM THE HOME FRONTS 



big, lacerating mural, Guernica, for the Spanish 
government pavilion at the Paris exposition of 
1937, and a series of hairy-nightmare etchings 
entitled Dream and Lie of Franco" (cat. no. 2). 
Reviewing the exhibition, McCausland returned to 
Guernica and praised Picasso for having "turned his 
gaze outward, away from the depths of subjective 
experience to the tragedies of social experience."' 
And, like many publications, the Nation singled out 
Guernica as the culmination of Picasso's achieve- 
ment, calling it the "supreme glory of his life." 8 

This focus on the painting certainly flowed from 
publicity generated by the tour, but it also reflected 
Alfred Ban's organization of the exhibition. By 
including not only the painting but fifty related 
works, he created a mini-exhibit within the full 
retrospective. And by showing only a few, rela- 
tively minor pieces from the two years following 
the completion of Guernica, he implied that this 
most recent work was less significant. 

Moreover, because the beginning of the war 
prevented the return of Guernica, as well as many 
other loans, the mural remained in the Modern's 
possession (at Picasso's request). After traveling to 
nine American cities, many works in the exhibition 
were retained by the museum for safekeeping, and

Guernica, in particular, was regularly brought out to 
serve as a symbol of opposition to not just Franco 
but Hitler as well. In August 1943, the Modem 
reinstalled the painting and issued a press release 
that explicitly linked the destruction of the Basque 
town to recent events across Europe. Noting that 
Guernica had been destroyed b\ the German 
Luftwaffe, the release continued, 

this destruction of a deft useless town was an expei 
iment by the German Luftwaffe in the psychological 

effect on the surrounding population of obliteration b\ 
air power of a hallowed center of a people 's culture and 
religion. Vie Germans considered the experiment (with 
its horrible mutilation and destruction of hundreds of 
human beings as well as cultural treasures and land- 
marks) an unqualified success. Reportedly it was 
written up in German military journals as an advance 
in the technique of total war. The technique was later 
employed against parts of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and 
in England at Plymouth, Coventry, and the national 
shrine of Canterbury; while London 's great Cathedral 
of St. Paul's was saved as though by a miracle when 
all around it was laid low by bombs.' 

The press release then recounted a report 
that seemed to show Picasso using the mural to 
condemn the Nazis' activities outside Spain. "There 
is a story that after the fall of Paris, Otto Abetz, 
Hitler's agent in the city, visited Picasso's studio, 
where the artist was still living. He saw a study 
sketch of the mural on Picasso's wall and asked the 
artist, "Did you do that?" "No," Picasso replied, 
"you did." This may be the first publication of this 
frequently told story, a tale that made the rounds in 
many variations during and after the war, some- 
times substituting a stream of unidentified officers 
for Abetz or postcard reproductions of the painting 
(given as souvenirs to uncomprehending Nazis) 
for the sketch. 

Before America entered the war. the Modern

a weapon against the country's enemies. The most 
extensive manifestation was The Road to Victory 
(June 1942), a "procession of photographs of the 
nation at war," organized by Edward Steichen, and 
an exhibition that served as a model for Steichen's 
later and far more popular Family of Man. Yet the 
museum placed most of its emphasis on less literal 
projects. The fall 1942 Bulletin claimed that 

THE MUSEUM COLLECTION is a symbol of 

one of the four freedoms for which we are fighting - 
the freedom of expression. Composed of painting, 
sculpture, architecture, photography, films and indus- 
trial design from 25 countries it is art that Hitler 
hates because it is modern, progressive, challenging; 
because it is international, leading to understanding 
and tolerance among nations; because it is free, the 
free expression of free men. '" 

Having already judged Picasso the greatest artist of 
the twentieth century, Barr placed him at the head 
of this offensive. 

The problem, or the advantage, was that no one 
knew what Picasso was doing. With his decision to 
return to Paris after the Nazis' conquest of France 
rather than accept invitations to flee to America, 
Picasso slipped into obscurity. For the first time in 
his career since the creation of cubism made him 
a public figure, he was not regularly observed by 
working journalists. A few articles appeared in the

American press, but these were based on old 
information. In 1942, Meric Callery, a sculptor 
and collector who had been a friend of Picasso's 
through the thirties, recounted for Art News "the 
last time I saw Picasso," but her story ended in 
1940 with good wishes - "And there in that 
stricken Paris he still is . . . Our thoughts go out to 
him and worry over him."" Rumors that Picasso 
had sold out to the Nazis, or, alternatively, had 
been thrown into a concentration camp, circulated 
without convincing serious observers. 

Exhibitions of his art were presented in America, 
but they were stuck in time, because most of his 
work in the country had been shipped over for the 
retrospective. Besides the Modern's own efforts, 
Picasso's longtime dealer, Paul Rosenberg, orga- 
nized several shows at the New York gallery he 
opened after he fled from France. But these con- 
sisted of stock pictures from the twenties and 
thirties he had lent to the exhibition, plus a few 
others he had sent to the 1939 World's Fair. Pierre 
Matisse provided another venue for the works in 
New York. Reviews were respectful of these 
familiar, increasingly classic paintings, but 
discussed them in exclusively stylistic terms, far 
removed from the reality of current events. 12 

In Paris, the situation obviously was much 
worse. Predictably, the collaborationist press 
ridiculed Picasso. If these pieces easily could be 
dismissed as slander, denunciations by some 
respected artists, particularly Maurice de Vlaminck, 
were startling, especially since Picasso had no way 
to respond to them in print." Throughout the 
Occupation, no one-man exhibition of his work 
occurred in France. Whether it was officially 
banned is not entirely clear. Certainly, the Nazis 
considered his art degenerate, and claims have 
been made that Franco's minister requested a pro- 
hibition. On the other hand, individual dealers 
may have chosen not to risk the retaliation that 
might well have resulted from the announcement 
of a show. Whatever the case, very few, if any, 
contemporary works by Picasso were exhibited in 
Paris during the war. After all, Rosenberg had left 
the country, and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler was 
hiding in the countryside while his daughter-in-law,

Louise Leiris, maneuvered to prevent the Nazis 
from taking possession of their gallery. Although 
she secured title in 1941, it would have been 
foolhardy to mount a display. As a photograph 
in Harriet and Sidney Janis's book illustrates, 
however, Leiris did buy wartime paintings from 
Picasso around the time of the Liberation, several 
of them among his most powerful (fig. 3)." 

With Picasso's traditional dealers out of the 
action or lying low, two new arrivals played a 
small role in buying and promoting his work. The 
most problematic was Martin Fabiani, who had 
taken over Ambroise Vollard's stock and pub 
lishing business after his death in 1939 (fig. 4). By- 
continuing with plans to publish an edition of the 
comte de Buffon's Histoire naturelle wilh illustrations 
by Picasso (1!)42), Fabiani ingratiated himself and 
was rewarded by a group of pencil portraits, which 



Picasso drew on 28 Jul) 1943. Unlike the portraits 
of Paul Rosenberg and his famil) that Pi&lt; asso made 
m 1918, this batch docs not mark the beginning ol 
a long relationship. Fabiani was far more interested 
in the market lor old -master, impressionist and 
post impressionist art, where the profits were much 
greater and a booming market thrived during the 
war. To capitalize on it, of course, he had to deal with 
the Nazis and their agents, and he had to be willing 
to accept items that were probabK illegally confis 
cated or coerced from their owners. Apparent l\ 
Fabiani had few scruples. His shady dealings did 
touch Picasso through trades or purchases, although 
little precise documentation of their transactions is 
known to exist. 

The second new arrival, Louis Carre (fig. 5), 
proved more substantial. In a small way, Carre had 
begun working with Picasso during the year or two 
before the war. 17 Since the artist's agreement with 
Rosenberg was limited to premiere vue, Picasso 
could sell to other dealers the paintings Rosenberg 
did not select. In the late thirties, Carre bought 
a few and discussed with Picasso his not very 
successful efforts to sell them in New York. When 
Rosenberg and Kahnweiler withdrew, Carre 
pursued a more substantial relationship, and 
Picasso responded. His first two exhibitions alter 
the war were held at the Galerie Louis Carre. 
Moreover, during the Occupation, Carre mounted 
some exhibitions of avant-garde art, particularly a 
show of Matisse drawings in November 1941. Most 
twentieth-century artists, including Matisse, were 
not prohibited from exhibiting by the Nazis, but 
Carre seems not to have organized a show of 
Picasso's work at this time."

In general, Picasso had little reason to sell his 
work during the war. He had plenty of money to 
cover living expenses, and potential buyers had 
access only to French francs (or, possibly, German 
scrip). Measured against the U.S. dollar or the 
Swiss franc, the French franc's abysmal value on 
the open market made it far more desirable to hold 
paintings for future sale than to build up a stock of 
dubious currency. 11 ' 

Thus, it seems that the works by Picasso on 
public view in Paris during the Occupation were 
almost entirely resale items — works that were 
offered at auction or in galleries by private col- 
lectors or dealers. 2 " The number was small and, as 
in New York, the works were almost certainly not 
current, having previously passed from Picasso to 
another owner. Only on one occasion does it 
appear that Picasso himself presented a work, 
probably a recent one. This was a charity auction 
to raise funds for indigent artists, an event that 
received attention in the Parisian press, but which 
did not appear to rouse the authorities to action." 1 

Throughout the Occupation, Picasso kept largely 
to himself and his circle of friends, confining his 
movements to the neighborhood of his Grands- 
Augustins studio and the apartment he provided 
for Marie-Therese Walter on the boulevard 
HenriTV. Despite sharing the very real physical 
deprivations most Parisians endured during this 
period and regular, intrusive visits from the Nazis, 
Picasso worked productively in his studio. Soon 
after the Liberation, he gave James Lord a rosy 
account of the time. "All he [Picasso] wanted in life 
was to be free to keep on working. By an irony, 
he added, the war years had been the most 
peaceful of his career. Denounced as degenerate 
and subversive, forbidden to exhibit, he had been 
left in peace to work as he pleased." Certainly, 
Picasso's experience was more harried than this 
retrospective comment implies, but it does capture 
the tremendous reduction in public attention that 
resulted from the blackout and the advantage 
he took of it. 

Meanwhile, concerned people across Paris and 
around the world waited for news of Picasso's 
activities. Probably no one listened more attentively 



and with greater devotion than Alfred Barr. 22 
When Picasso once again became a center 
of media attention in the weeks following the 
Liberation, Barr labored to gather all the published 
accounts, canvas mutual friends, and even question 
Picasso. Barr was not only eager to catch up with 
Picasso's recent activities, he also wanted to know 
whether the direct political engagement evident in 
Picasso's prewar art had continued, all in prepa- 
ration for an updated version of his 1939 catalogue, 
the book that would become the basic text on 
Picasso for decades, Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art. 
He published a preliminary account of his findings 
in the Museum of Modern Art Bulletin for January 
1945, "Picasso 1940-1944: A Digest with Notes." 
In this admittedly provisional analysis, Barr 
affirmed Picasso's unique importance on two 
fronts. Highlighting the Nazis' condemnation of 
Picasso's art, Barr cited Dream and Lie of Franco and 
Guernica to confirm the political significance of his 
work. (Barr had so far seen only a small number of 
the wartime works, mainly in reproduction.) Barr 
also found patriotic value in the artist's life during 
the Occupation. "He was not allowed to exhibit 
publicly and he made no overt gestures but his very 
existence in Paris encouraged the Resistance artists, 
poets and intellectuals who gathered in his studio or 
about his cafe table." He then cited Gladys Delmas, 
"a young American who lived through the occu- 
pation period in Paris": "Picasso's presence here 
during the occupation became of tremendous occult 
importance ... his work has become a sort of banner 
of the Resistance Movement." 2 ' 

Indeed, Barr's double-barreled praise largely 
reflected the opinion of respected publications. 
In late October, the New York Times Magazine had 
reported a similar status: 

Today Picasso stands out as the standard-bearer of the 
artistic movement. In the first place, his attitude 
during the occupation has won general admiration. 
He steadfastly refused to fall for propaganda wiles 
as did too many French painters and sculptors. He 
neither exhibited his works in Paris under German 
auspices nor accepted junketing tours through the 
Reich under the plea that "art has no country." And 



1 18 REPORTS FROM THE HOME FRONTS 



when the German authorities offered him coal with 
which to heal his studio he replied that he preferred 
to freeze - like most Parisians. For these reasons - 
and others - Picasso occupies the place of honor in the 
Autumn Salon/' 

As a matter of future interest, the Times reported 
without comment Picasso's recent affiliation with 
the Communist Party and his remark that he 
"prefers not to discuss this matter." 

The difference between Barr's account and that 
of the Times and most other publications is the 
claim that Picasso was more than a symbol of intel- 
lectual independence to Resistance members, that 
they actually gathered in his studio and around 
him at cafes. Christian Zervos, who had served in 
the Resistance, immediately fired off a letter of 
correction."' ' "I have just read the note you have 
published on Picasso-as-Resistance worker in the 
Bulletin of the Museum. For the love of Picasso, 
do not include these notes in a book on the artist." 
Going on to criticize the sources as "bad journalism," 
Zervos declared emphatically that Picasso had not 
been active in the Resistance: "The participation 
of Picasso in the Resistance is false. Picasso simply 
kept his dignity during the Occupation the way 
millions of people did here. But he never got 
involved in the Resistance. Realize that his work 
itself is the greatest form of resistance." 

No doubt startled by the vehemence of Zervos's 
denial, Barr sought to question Picasso directly. 
Through a friend, James Plant, who had been 
director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in 
Boston and was then an Office of Strategic Services 
(OSS) officer leading the American investigation of 
Nazi art looting, Barr submitted a list of written 
queries about various matters to Picasso's secretary, 
Jaime Sabartes, who supposedly showed them to 
Picasso and noted his replies." When Plaut sent 
Barr the responses in October 1945, he described 
the process and his concerns about the results: 

/ enclose herewith the Picasso material. The circum- 
stances under which it was obtained were the antici- 
pated ones. P. has kept himself incommunicado for the 
past month, and has been in Paris only sporadically. 



. . . I laid it on thick with S. [Sabartes] who 
responded well to blandishments (augmented by 
cigars, soap and chocolate!). Even he, ifom is to 
believe him, has seen P. very seldom of late . . . S. 
obtained answers to all questions which, in his words, 
P. considered relevant. I [eel that they an. in wm^ 
degree, evasive and unsatisfactory but - on the wholt 
- they are rather more detailed and informative than 
I had expected. 

Coming from a seasoned interrogator accustomed 
to grilling Nazi officials and collaborationist dealers, 
this ultimately positive judgment deserves respect 
especially since Picasso answered "no" to Ban's 
question about whether the Resistance forces had 
met in his studio. 

When Barr prepared the final text for Fifty Years, 
he largely adhered to Zervos's position. Introducing 
his discussion with Picasso's refusal of offers 
of sanctuary in America and noting that press 
accounts of his activities during the Occupation 
have been "embellished by journalistic legend," 
he nonetheless asserted Picasso's great symbolic 
importance and recounted the episode, observed 
by John Groth, of Picasso's being solicited by 
Eluard to be the first artist to inscribe a book for 
presentation to de Gaulle. 

Picasso, unlike his fiends Paul Eluard and another 
ex-Surrealist poet Louis Aragon, had taken no active 
part in the underground Resistance movement, yet, as 
has been indicated, Picasso's presence in Paris while 
the Germans were there had gradually taken on an 
aura of great symbolic importance. His attitude had 
been passive but it had been implacable and uncom- 
promising and had created a legend which had 
probably been more effective than if he himself had 
joined the F.F.I. /Forces francaises de T interieurj 
and gone underground.^ 

Barr must have been well aware that nothing in 
Picasso's past suggested that he would have taken 
this extreme course. 

If Ban revised his characterization of Picasso's 
life during the Occupation, he pressed further the 
assertion that Picasso's art engaged the politics ot 



MICH Mill l/C.I K M I) in

his time. Calling the Charnel House (cat. no. 82) 
"Picasso's most important postwar composition," 
Barr presented it as the answer to those who 
doubted the seriousness of his art, or sought to 
explain it exclusively in terms of formal issues. 
Lamenting that the painting was not finished in 
time to be included in the Victoria and Albert 
exhibition in December 1945 of Picasso's and 
Matisse's wartime work, Barr offered it as the 
proof of Picasso's intentions: 

The Charnel House might have sobered those who 
found Picasso 's distortions an outrageous effrontery; 
it might have embarrassed those defenders who, 
ignoring the psychological tensions of his recent art, 
still tried to seek refuge in the esthetic of form and 
color so dogmatically popularized in the 1920s; and 
it might have stilled those who demanded that 
Picasso deal more directly and explicitly with the 
state of the world. 1 * 

Barr then gave his interpretation of how Picasso's 
art was relevant: "The Guernica was a modern 
Laocoon, a Calvary, a doom picture. Its symbols 
transcend the fate of the little Basque city to 
prophesy Rotterdam and London, Kharkov and 
Berlin, Milan and Nagasaki - our dark age. In the 
Charnel House there are no symbols and, perhaps, no 
prophecy. Its figures are facts - the famished, waxen 
cadavers of Buchenwald, Dachau and Belsen." 2! ' 



When the wartime paintings were first shown, at 
the Salon d'Automne from October to November 
1944, their specific content seems to have been 
submerged in the outcry by academics and anti- 
communists over the decision to show anything 
by Picasso in an official setting (figs. 6-7). At the 
Victoria and Albert exhibition of works by Picasso 
and Matisse, the focus of criticism was, again, pri- 
marily the reputations of the artists rather than the 
specific work on view. It was not until the following 
summer, when Carre held an exhibition at his 
gallery, that the paintings themselves were seriously 
examined in the press. 1 " Art News reported a wide- 
spread belief: they were not shocking or even 
particularly surprising to those who knew Picasso's 
earlier work. "To Picasso's American audience, 
familiar at best with work of the late 'thirties, these 
oils may not indicate any very radical departure." 31 
Of course, everyone except a small circle of friends 
had been in the dark about the recent work. As 
critics became more familiar with it, they began to 
identify elements of style and subject matter that 
seemed to reflect the experience of the war. More 
than any other published source, Harriet and 
Sidney Janis's book probably attuned audiences to 
these possibilities, even though the Janises empha- 
sized formal innovation over social content. By 
1947, Art News reviewed one of the dealer Samuel 
Kootz's exhibitions in New York with the summary 
comment, "Here is the now famous war style of vio- 
lently abstracted sailors, skulls, and tomato plants." 32 

Kootz's appearance is indicative of the state of 
the Picasso market in the early postwar years. 
Despite Picasso's considerable productivity during 
the war and a lack of buyers that had resulted in a 
large stock of paintings, there was not a continuous 
outpouring of exhibitions once peace arrived. After 
the celebratory exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne 
and the Victoria and Albert Museum, relatively 
few of Picasso's pictures were on view in Paris or 
New York. The 1945 exhibition at Carre's gallery 
included twenty-one of the wartime paintings, a few 
of which contained relatively obvious references 
to the war. The following summer, Carre held 
another show. Although it began with the great 
prewar canvas Night Fishing at Antibes (cat. no. 31),

the selection was dominated by the pastoral work 
that Picasso had done in spring 1940. This was 
Picasso's last exhibition with Carre, and no other 
dealers immediately stepped in to take his place. 
Picasso's ties with Paul Rosenberg had been 
permanently severed by the war, and Kahnweiler 
was cautious about picking up the contract. As 
Francoise Gilot recounted, Picasso used the free- 
spending Kootz to goad Carre and Kahnweiler 
toward greater commitments. 

The exhibitions Kootz presented from 1947 to 
1948 were high on hype but low on paintings - 
both numbers and quality." By 1947, Kahnweiler 
had concluded a deal to represent Picasso's work, 
yet he did not hold an exhibition of the paintings 
until May 1953.' ' So, during the late forties and 
earlv fifties, Picasso's work was not widely shown. 
Even when they were available, the wartime pic- 
tures, in particular, seem not to have been in great 
demand by buyers. This is one reason why Sallv 
and Victor Ganz were able to buy important 
paintings for fairly low prices. To cite only one 
example, in 1948 they bought Still Life with Blood 
Sausage (cat. no. 42) from Kahnweiler for $5,000; 
Leiris had bought it from Picasso at least several 
years earlier (it appears in a photo of the gallery; 
see fig. 3). 36 

But il Picasso's work was not widely seen during 



these years, his name was more frequentl) in the 
press. When Picasso declared his adherence to the 
Communist Party in October 19 1 1, most critics 
accepted his explanation thai he was expressing an 
admiration for the party's leadership in the Resis 
tance, a role that was widely admired at the time. 
Despite Picasso's denial that his work was program 
matic, left-leaning critics, such as McCausland, and 
reporters, such as Jerome Seckler, saw an affirmation 
of the political involvement Picasso had shown with 
Guernica, and sought to identify it in his current 
work.' Certainly, Picasso's standing as a man of 
culture grew through the late forties. In 1917, Life 
went so far as to assert that "the only person in 
France who can compare with Picasso as a subject 
of conversation is Charles de Gaulle." 

Increasingly, this notoriety rested on Picasso's 
association with the party. The most prominent 
events were his participation in the first Congress 
of Intellectuals for Peace in Wroclaw, Poland, in 
August 1.948, the Party Conference held in Paris in 
April 1949, and the Second World Peace Confer- 
ence held in Sheffield, England, in October 1950. 
By that year, opinion in America and in France 
was tinged with disrespect. The New York Times ran 
an article ridiculing both his allegiance to the party 
and the drawings of doves he had provided as 
emblems of world peace. And the newspaper but- 
tressed its account by relating the lambasting he 
had received in segments of the French press. " A 
few years later, even Alfred Barr admitted privately 
his disgust with Picasso's political activities. After 
his promotion of Picasso as a force against dicta- 
torship, Barr must have been deeply disappointed 
by the artist's willingness to make a portrait of 
Stalin in 1953 and paint the openly propagandistic 
Massacre in Korea (1951). 4 " 

To a considerable extent, the blackout of 
Picasso's art that began with the Occupation con- 
tinued through most of the postwar decade and left 
a vacuum of expectations that was filled by assump- 
tions about the man, not the artist. By the mid 
fifties, he would grow tired of the farce, drop his 
public involvement in politics, and withdraw into a 
personal world of art." But during the previous 
fifteen vears, he had been, in a sense, besieged.

PICASSD 



JANUARY 19 3 7 

Having left the chateau of Boisgeloup in Gisors, Normandy, alter 
separating from his wife Olga Khokhlova, Picasso again lives in Fans 
in his apartment at 23, rue La Boetie. Toward the end of 1936 he 

also had taken a studio in the dealer Amhroise Yollard's house at Le 
Tremblay-sur-Mauldre. He established Marie Therese Walter there 
with their daughter Maya and, over the next lew years, would pay 
them short visits. 

Picasso participates in an exhibition organized at the Galerie clu front 
Populaire, 83, rue La Boetie, in support of the Republican forces in 
Spain. The exhibition Braque, Matisse, Picasso takes place at the (ialerie 
Paul Rosenberg, 21, rue La Boetie. 

With the help of Dora Maar, who soon after takes an apartment 
nearby in the rue de Savoie, Picasso finds a new studio at 7, rue des 
Grands- Augustins (6th arrondissement). He occupies the top two floors 
in a seventeenth-century house that before the Revolution was the 
Hotel de Savoie-Carignan. Traditionally the house is identified as 
Balzac's site for his chef-d'oeuvre inconnu. Before Picasso's occupanc v, 
the actor Jean-Louis Barrault used the upper floor as a rehearsal hall, 
and the lower floor continued to be used by a weaving shop. Picasso 
also now rents a small annex studio on the same street that he uses to 
store sculptures. 

l - Picasso, with Dora Maar and his son Paulo, visits Max Jacob at the 
Benedictine abbey at St.-Benoit-sur-Loire, where Jacob had lived since 
1921. This is their last direct contact. 

s - 9 - Picasso etches the plates for the Dream and Lie oj Franco (cat. 
no. 2). The etchings, with a separate sheet containing a poem by 
Picasso, are sold to benefit the Spanish Republic. All eighteen designs 
in the sequence are also printed separately as postcards for sale. 

Around midmonth, a delegation from the Spanish Republican 
government, including the architectjosep Lluis Sert, designer of the 
Spanish Republican Pavilion for the 1937 World's Fair in Paris; the 
writer Louis Aragon;Jose Gaos, general commissioner of the Spanish 
Pavilion; Juan Larrea, poet and director of public information for the 
Spanish embassy; and Max Aub, the cultural delegate for the Spanish 
embassy, calls upon Picasso in the rue La Boetie to invite him to paint 
a mural for the Spanish Pavilion, originally scheduled to open on 
May Day. 

In mid-January Jaime Sabartes moves out of Picasso's apartment, 
temporarily interrupting his service to Picasso as secretary and confidant.

published in 1948 as Les Sculptures de Picasso (Paris) with a text by

back to the studio by hand carts, at night, "right under the nose of the 
German patrols."

how and when Picasso first learns of the arrest, but the statement often 
attributed to him-"Max is an elf. He doesn't need us to fly out of his 
prison"— may be apocryphal. Cocteau prepares, in league with the 
collaborationist publisher Georges Prade, a petition to the German 
embassy on Jacob's behalf, but it is not known who signed it and if it 
ultimately was sent. Picasso attends the mass for Jacob at St.-Roch

are crowded together in the audience, including Brassai, Braque and 
his wife, Valentine Hugo, Jacques Lacan, Sabartes, Reverdy, Jean- 
Louis Barrault, Georges and Sylvia Bataille, Toesca, Dubois, Henri 
Michaux, and Lucienne and Armand Salacrou. Picasso displays a 
portrait of Jacob during the proceedings. After the reading, Picasso 
escorts a group back to his studio and shows them an original 
manuscript bv Alfred Jam. Others remain at the Leiris apartment for 
dinner and extend the party beyond the curfew, through the whole 
night. Despite criticism of the play by some of Picasso's friends, the 
event generally is deemed a major success.

1996), 48. Roland Penrose describes a visit with Picasso's mother, during 
which she reported the incident of a burning convent near her apartment, 
in Scrap Book, 1900-1981 (New York: Rizzoli, 1981), 85. 
A photograph of this sculpture is reproduced by Rosamond Bernier, 
Matisse, Picasso, Miro as 1 Knew Them (New York: Knopf, 1991), 147, who 
also quotes Picasso on the origin of the work as a flea market bust of 
Venus that Picasso's father reworked with plaster and then painted. 
Baer, Gravures, 52, and her essay in this volume. 
On Picasso's connections with the Republican government, and his 
support of different relief efforts, see Chipp, Guernica, 1 f. ; Cone, Artists 
Under Vichy, 151-52; Utley, "Picasso and the 'Parti,'" 53-54, 57-59. 
Alfred Barr quotes Mary Gallery, purchaser of the important painting 
Woman with a Cock, as saying that Picasso did not wish to sell the work 
but agreed to do so only because he wanted to raise money for Spanish 
aid. [Fifty Yean, 265.) In fall 1938, Picasso sent Guernica for exhibition 
in England under the auspices of the National Joint Committee for 
Spanish Relief. 

Penrose, Life, 324, reported that he went to Picasso's apartment and saw 
the recentlv finished Night Fishing at Antibes on the night after Hitler's 
invasion of Poland. He must have been mistaken in his dates, however, 
since Jaime Sabartes recorded Picasso's departure from Antibes on 26 
August [Picasso: An Intimate Portrait [New York: Prentice Hall, 1948], 
182-83). 

For reviews of the considerable literature on this painting, see William 
Rubin, Picasso in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art (New York: The 
Museum of Modern Art, 1972), 232-33, and Timothy Anglin Burgard, 
"Picasso's Night Fishing at Antibes: Autobiography, Apocalypse, and the 
Spanish Civil War," Art Bulletin 68, no. 4 (December 1986); esp. 656 n. 1.

City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1946), text to pi. 5. 

These towers are generally described in literature on the painting as both 
belonging to the chateau Grimaldi, but this is not the case.

a la fin du quinzieme siecle (Paris: Editions Cahiers d'Art, 1937), pi. 80, 
no. 133. A major exhibition on medieval Catalonian art entitled 
L'Art Catalan du Xe au XVe siecle was presented at the Musee du Jeu 
de Paume in Paris in March and April of 1937, and Picasso served on 
the organizing committee. 

Ibid., pi. 5. On the influence of Catalonian art on Picasso, see also 
Chipp, Guernica, 87-89, and Pierre Cabanne, Pablo Picasso: His Life and 
Times (New York: William Morrow, 1977), 77-78. 

Lydia Gasman throws much new light on the question of Picasso's fear 
of aerial bombardment, and its reflection in his work, in her essay in 
this book. Sabartes brief comments on the painting are also illuminating 
vis-a-vis its underlying emotive message: "[Picasso] could not have 
refrained from expressing the heavy emotions and the increasingly 
tragic presentiments which hovered over us in those days." (Sabartes, 
Intimate Portrait, 181.)

49. Rumors that Picasso had taken part in the Resistance movement began 
to circulate internationally at the time of the Liberation. Some of these 
rumors were put into writing, for example, by Alfred Barr in "Picasso 
1940-1944: A Digest with Notes," Museum of Modern Art Bulletin 12, no. 3 
(January 1945), where he notes that "[Picasso's] position in the Resis- 
tance Movement is of unique importance" (2), and that "[Picasso's] very 
existence in Paris encouraged the Resistance artists, poets and intellectu- 
als who gathered in his studio or about his cafe table" (2). Other writers 
sympathetic to Picasso's postwar politics also have sought to fortify any 
possible linkage with the Resistance and paint an activist role for his art. 
Emile Szittya, for example, claims that "the works of Picasso, particulai lv 
those that he created during the Occupation, all demonstrate a barely 
concealed action against fascism" (in "Notes sur Picasso," Courrier des 
arts et des lettres [Paris, 1947], 24). Pierre Daix writes, "II suffit dire que 
Picasso a ete considere par tous les resistants actifs-Eluard, Yvonne et 
Christian Zervos, . . . Louise et Michel Leiris qui hebergerent le dirigeant 
communiste Laurent Casanova, Laurent Casanova lui meme-comme un 
des leurs par les idees et le courage" [La Vie de peintre, 296). For some of 
the false accusations of collaborationist activities, see Seckler, "Picasso 
Explains," 4. Utley lists more sources on this subject, "Picasso and the 
'Parti,'" (SO and 111 n. 226. 

50. It became a common ploy for Picasso's detractors during the war years 
to label him as Jewish or group him among artists negatively influenced 
by "Jewish" elements in modern art. For example, Fernand Demeure 
wrote, "Picasso, e'est le delire juif. II a le don inne du pastiche et cette 
soif native de detruire, comme a tout fils ou demi-fils d'Israel" (in 
"Explications de quelques maitres modernes," Le Reveil du Peuple [Paris, 
29 March 1944]). The most famous denouncements of Picasso as a 
Jewish artist came in Fritz Rene Vanderpyl, LArt sans patrie, un mensonge: 

Le pinceau d'Israel (Paris: Mercure de France, 1942); John Hemming Fry, 
Art decadent sous le regne de la democratic et du communisme (Paris: Henri 
Colas, 1940); and Maurice de Vlaminck, "Opinions fibres . . . sur la 
peinture," Comoedia'2, no. 50 (6 June 1942): 1, 6 (reprised in his Portraits 
avant deces [Paris: Flammarion, 1943], 181-89). 

51. The letter from the Office de placement allemand dated 16 September 
1943 instructing Picasso to appear for his preliminary examination and 
to sign a work contract was discovered in the archives of the Musee 
Picasso by Gertje Utley (see Utley, "Picasso and the 'Parti,'" 61). The 
letter reads in part: "you have been selected to leave as part of the 
program of voluntary workers to Germany. . . . We expect that you will 
understand vour duty towards Europe and that . . . you will answer our 
appeal willingly. You are forewarned that any attempt at sabotage or any 
failing will be mercilessly punished." In 1941, Picasso had transformed 
press photographs propagandizing the work program in Germany into 
blistering parodies by drawing over them in pencil, changing the faces 
of happy workers into monstrosities. See Anne Baldassari, Picasso and 
Photography: The Dark Mirror, exh. cat. (Paris: Flammarion; Houston: 
Museum of Fine Arts, 1997), figs. 246-47. 

52. Andre-Louis Dubois, A trovers trois republiques: Sous le signe de Tamitie 
(Paris: Plon, 1972), 144: "Des bruits circulaient que repercutait Maurice 
Toesca [another friend of Picasso's]. Nous voulions que Picasso reste 
invisible pour que personne ne pense a lui, qu'il soit oublie." 

53. For specific auctions, exhibitions, and dates, consult the Chronology in

5 1. fean Cocteau is one source for the report that a Picasso painting was 
ordered off of view. See Journal 1942-1945 (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 
1989), 298-99. Picasso repeated many times to friends and interviewers 
that he had been prohibited from exhibiting during (he Occupation specif- 
ic ally due to a request by the Spanish Embassy to German authorities.

94. Cowling in Elizabeth Cowling and John Golding, Picasso: Sculptor /Painter, 
exh. cat. (London: Tate Gallery, 1994), cat. no. 105, dates the sculpture 
to February or March 1943, based in part on Brassai's assertion (Brassai, 
Picasso and Company, 51). Picasso told Brassai that he was aided in his 
work on the sculpture by Paul Eluard and his chauffeur Marcel. He 
modeled the form in clay in a single session. Because the armature was 
not strong enough to support the weight of the clay, however, the 
sculpture began to collapse and had to be held up with ropes tied to the 
ceiling. To stabilize it, Picasso had the work cast into plaster and it was 
this plaster, made in two sections for greater ease of handling, that stood 
in Picasso's studio for the remainder of the war and is now part of the 
collection of the Centra de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid (ibid., 161). The 
animal in the sculpture is referred to in early sources, and by Picasso 
himself, as both "mouton" and "agneau." We have chosen to use the 
title Man with a Lamb because it better fulfills the sacrificial implications 
of the sculpture.

Tuchman has proposed that the man in the sculpture is a portrait of 
Max Jacob. See "Picasso's Sentinel," Art in America 86, no. 2 (February

98. Pudney, "Picasso: A Glimpse," 182-83: "[Picasso] believes that outside 
events caused him to seek a greater objectivity. He said that the tendency 
in the creative artist is to stabilize mankind on the verge of chaos. 'A 
more disciplined art, less constrained freedom, in a time like this is the 
artist's defense and guard,' Picasso said. 'Very likely for the poet it is a 
time to write sonnets. Most certainly it is not a time for the creative man 
to fail, to shrink, to stop working.'" Gertje LItley discusses the painting in 
the context of the neonationalistic thinking that arose in France after the 
Liberation as a reassertion of traditional French values, a movement that 
included some factions highly critical of Picasso. "Picasso and the French 
Post-war 'Renaissance': A Questioning of National Identity," in Picasso 
and the Spanish Tradition (New Haven and London: Yale University 
Press, 1996), 107-108. For more on Picasso's bacchanal, see Susan Grace 
Galassi, in Picasso 's Variations on the Masters: Confronting the Past (New 
York: Harry N. Abrams, 1996), 90-94. 

99. Although the Monument to the Spanish does not appear in the exhibition 
catalogue, various writers who saw the show record its presence there. 
For example, see Daix, La Vie de peintre, 328, and Kahnweiler, Galleries 
and Painters, 120. On the iconography of the painting, see Utley, "Picasso 
and the 'Parti,'" 172-75 (who questions its inclusion in Art et resistance), 
and Cowling and Golding, Sculptor/Painter, cat. no. 114. Picasso owned a 
bugle very similar to the one in the painting, which he loved to blow. It 
is shown, complete with its tassels, in a photograph by Cecil Beaton of 
Picasso in his studio (Picasso Archives, Musee Picasso, Paris). 

100. See Robert Rosenblum, "The Spanishness of Picasso's Still Lifes," in

102 Disc ussion of I he possible influence of news about the concentration 
camps is found in Utley, "Picasso and the 'Parti,'" 127 f., and Baldassari, 
Photography, 214, figs. 244 and 245. William Rubin, among others, wrote 
that Picasso had painted Charnel House in response to revelations of the 
camps (Rubin. Mini inn of Modern Art, 166 I lowc\ c-i . the fact that pho 
tographs oi the- camps and their victims taken during the Allied liberta- 
imus did not appear until April 1945 after the painting was begun, has 
cast doubt on this assertion. Utley and Baldassari show, nevertheless, 
tli at Pic asso was c erlainh aware of I lie Camps and had even seen 
photographs ol them well belore stalling work on Charnel House. 



Picasso sought out Daix at one point, who was a survivor of a German 
concentration camp, to ask him how closely Charnel House matched the 
reality of the camps and exterminations (Daix, La Vie de peintre, 322). 

103. See Rubin, Museum of Modern Art, 238-41, and Gertje Utley's essay in this 
volume for photographs of different stages of the painting's development 
and discussion of the dates involved. The most detailed account of this 
development is found in Utley, "Picasso and the 'Parti,'" 127 f. 

104. Picasso exhibited the painting in Art et resistance in Paris in February 
and March of 1946. He agreed to donate it to the Communist veterans 
association to be sold to raise money but apparently desired to work 
on it further. He kept it for several more years before selling it in 1954. 
Although it is signed and dated 1945, he definitely worked on it later 
but seems to have made the last changes by April 1946.

this lack of finish.

Picasso's Disasters of War: The Art of Blasphemy 

Robert Rosenblum 

Some of the material in this essay was first given as a lecture at the Museo 
Nacional del Prado on 14January 1996, and then published, in a Spanish 
translation, as "El Guernica de Picasso: El conjunto y las partes," in 
El Museo del Prado: Fragmentos y detalles (Madrid: Fundacion Amigos 
del Prado, 1997), 175-90. 

1. On Picasso's intentions for the eventual display of Guernica in Madrid, 
see the statement by his lawyer, Roland Dumas, in Ellen C. Oppler, ed., 
Picasso's Guernica (New York and London: Norton, 1988), 153-55. 

2. The relationship between Guernica and Goya's Third of May, 1808 and 
Disasters of War was already noted in 1937 by Jose Bergamin in "Le 
Mystere tremble: Picasso furioso," Cahiers d'Art 7, nos. 4-5 (1937): 
137-39. Since then, the comparison of Guernica to Goya's war imagery 
has been made countless times in both general and specific ways. See, 
for example, Herschel B. Chipp, Picasso's Guernica: History, 
Transformations, Meanings (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University 
of California Press, 1988), passim. 

3. This plausible suggestion was made in Hugh Thomas, Goya: The Third 
of May 1808 (New York: Viking Press, 1973), 94. The actual buildings 
depicted by Goya seem to elude precise identification. 

4. "La lanterne, e'est la Mort." See Andre Malraux, La Tele d'obsidienne 
(Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1974), 42. Picasso also commented on the 
strange overall lighting of the painting, which resembled, but was differ- 
ent from, moonlight. For a fascinating study of Goya's lantern in the con- 
text of scientific invention and the symbolism of the Enlightenment, see 
Albert Boime, "La luz mortifera de Goya y la Ilustracion," in El Museo del 
Prado: Fragmentes y detalles, 291-323. Boime also refers here to the parallel 
symbolism of the lightbulb in Guernica. 

5. For some provocative comments on the newness of Gova's religious 
paintings, see Fred Licht, Goya and the Origins of the Modern Temper in Art 
(New York: Universe Books, 1979), ch. 3. 

6. Goya: Exposition de Toeuvre grave, de peintures, de tapisseries et de cent-dix

1881-1907 (New York: Rizzoli, 1981), 92-93.

Social Movements in Picasso's Barcelona (Berkeley: University of California 
Press, 1992), 55-56. 

9. See the discussion in John Richardson, "Picasso's Apocalyptic 
Whorehouse," New York Review of Books Mi, no. 7 (23 April 1987): 40-47.

phenomenologicaJ insights into aerial terror, Picasso's wartime poetry 
presents the "bombs going into a dive" (172), the "wailings of sirens" 
(21 1 , the "cement of the sky" (205), its "liquid bricks" (239) "fall[ing] 
1 1 inn the high furnaces of the blue" (23 I), heaven and its "mantle of cru-

21. Picasso was prescient. As early as 14 December 1935, in an untitled poem 
appended to his (handwritten) collage-text (61, 65) made up of clippings 
from Le Journal (8 December 1935, 2-3) that mentioned the Third Reich 
and the "Italo-Ethiopian conflict" (ibid.) - when the Duce's air force 
bombed hospitals and civilians - the "threat of the wing" (65) hovers 
over a couple in love and their sobbing infant. Picasso's menacing wing 
elicits, specifically, the "Italian squadrons" that, as the headlines in Le 
Journal broadcast (ibid., 1, 5), heavily bombed Dese, the capital of central 

Ethiopia, while the French and the British were discussing the possibilitv 
of a "reglement amiable du conflit italo-etiopien" and Mussolini was 
declaiming an "ardent discours contre les sanctions" against Italy 
imposed by the League of Nations. Read in relation to these headlines 
dominated by the air war in Ethiopia, such purposefully selected citations 
in Picasso's collage-text inevitably suggest the connection he established 
between death coming down from the sky, life on earth, and his personal 
existence: "les enfants martyrises" (61) [Le Journal, 8 December, 2); 
"l'appel des morts de la guerre" (til) (Le Journal, ibid.); "oiseaux qui . . . 
partirent, laissant derriere eux des figures de nouveau ravagees" (65) 
(Le Journal, ibid.); "expirante . . . sous une armoire" (65) (Le Journal, 
ibid.); "la mort mysterieuse d'une infirmiere" (65) (Le Journal, ibid., 3); 
"l'arbre de Noel des petits Italiens" (65) (Le Journal, ibid., 2). Even 
"donneuses de lait" (65)(Le Journal, ibid.) becomes an allusion to Marie- 
Therese nursing Maya under the "threat of the wing," a scene that one 
day later Picasso conjured in his elegiac drawing, Marie-Terese nourissant 
Maya (15 November 1935; Robert Rosenblum, "Picasso's Blond Muse: 
The Reign of Marie-Therese," in Picasso and Portraiture, exh. cat. (New 
York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1996), 366. On 14 December, for 
the first time in his writings, Picasso replaced the traditional benevolent 
wing, which not long ago touched the "harmonium with its caress" ( 17 
August 1935, 23), with a hostile apparition, the "threat of the wing" (65). 
And a few months later, just three d,i\s after a brutal skirmish between 
the Republican Left and the Falange, "which suggested that civil war had 
almost begun," Picasso contemplates the "first rendezvous of the wings" 
in the "blue |sk\ | setting on fire [the] black of the space" (19 April 1930. 
122). The news concerning the savage bombings in Spain reached

63. Sabartes, in Picasso: An Intimate Portrait, trans, from the Spanish by Angel 
Flores (New York: Prentice Hall, 1948), states that Picasso left Paris 
"towards midnight" (188) on "September 3," 1939 (187), and arrived in 
Royan on "September 4," 1939 (189). But the French translation of the 
original Spanish text by Sabartes, Picasso: Portraits et souvenirs, trans. 
Paule-Marie Grand and Andre Chastel (Paris: Louis Carre and 
Maximilien Vox, 1946), states that Picasso left Paris "vers minuit" 

(198) on "29 aout" 1939 (196) and arrived in Royan on "2 Septembre" 
1939 199). Though these same dates are later given in Sabartes's 
Picasso.Recuerdos y retratos, published in 1953 (208-10), the four days 
ascribed to Picasso's trip from Paris to Royan do not make sense. Given 
that there are some 500 kilometers between Paris and Royan and since, 
as we read in Picasso: Portraits et souvenirs itself, Picasso and Sabartes trav- 
eled "a plus de cent a l'heure. . .le plus vite possible" (198) "toute la nuit" 

(199) - making the trip in one single night - it could not have possibly 
lasted four days, from 29 August to 2 September. 

Picasso: An Intimate Portrait offers the more consistent account. 
Similarly, the chronology in the Rubin 1980 catalogue for the Picasso 
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art establishes that Picasso left 
Paris on 3 September 1939 (350). However, the chronology in Musee 
Picasso I states that Picasso left for Royan on 1 September 1939 (291). 
The inconsistent, confusing dates given in Picasso: Portraits et souvenirs 
also seem to account for the contradictory and apparently erroneous 
dates given for Picasso's departure from Paris, and for his arrival in 
Royan, by, for example, Brassai, Picasso and Company, 40; Cabanne, 
Le Siecle de Picasso, 2:49; Daix, Picasso createur: La Vie inlime et I'oeuvre 
(Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1987), 273; and Patrick O'Brian, Picasso: Pablo 
Ruiz Picasso, A Biography (New York: Putnam, 1976), 344. Penrose seems 
to have given up the task of specifying the dates of Picasso's departure 
from Paris and arrival in Royan [Picasso: His Life and Work, 324-25).

Spanish original "nubes carretas") (11 August 1940, 234) can be read as

Calligrammes; 265, "75" was the name of a cannon used for harassing 
"enemy lines"; note that Picasso dated his 7 February 1914 letter to 
Apollinaire: "7 Fevrier 1915/Journee du 75." See Picasso/ 'Apollinaire 
Correspondence, ed. Pierre Caizergue and Helene Seckel (Paris: Editions 
Gallimard, 1992), 129. The landing of Wilbur Wright's flying machine 
on 8 August 1908 was compared to a "partridge returning to its nest."

71. In 1957, commenting (in a conversation with Jean-Marie Magnan) on 
nonsensical passages in a Spanish translation of a French article, Picasso 
seemed to allude to the almost systematic recurrence of euphemism in 
his beuvre: "we the Spanish place everything upside down. When a little 
girl is pretty we say 'que mona,' in other words, 'what a monkey.' With 
inversion everything becomes more forceful, more distinct." Cited in

74. The aerial war on the Channel seems to have been in the back of 
Picasso's mind because on 17 July, for example, he spontaneously associ-

suggests in his writings, to trap the entrapping spaces of the air filled 
with a "network of threads" (213), "entangled threads" (212), "veins 
entangled with the electric lines" (223), and the "play of parabolas and 
the amusement of hyperbolas" (159).

10. Sidra Stich, "Picasso's Art and Politics in 1936," Arts Magazine 58 
(October 1983): 113-18, interprets the gouache as an allegory of the 
Popular Front's resistance to the spread of fascism. 

11. It was assumed that the gouache was selected among Picasso's works to 
serve as model for the stage curtain for Romain Rolland's play, Le 14 
juillet, commissioned for that year's 14 July celebrations. I have found 
evidence, however, that Picasso actually produced the drawing expressly 
for the event.

17. A noti&lt; c in Europe, 15 August 1936, reads that the Maison de la culture 
sent a telegram of support lo President Campanys of the Spanish 
Republic. Among the signatories was Picasso. 

18. In a letter from Valencia dated 17 December 1936, the underset retar) ol

Resistance in France, in particular of writers such as Sartre and Camus. 

23. The last three scenes were drawn injune only and relate more directly 
to Guernica. 

24. In an interview with Georges Sadoul, Picasso called the etchings "un acte 
d'execration de 1'attentat dont est victime le peuple espagnol" {Regards, 
29 July 1937, 8). In December 1937 the work was part of the exhibition 
LArt cruel at the Galerie Billiet-Worms in Paris. 

25. Eluard, who was present, recalled how distressed Bergamin's report had 
left them. Gateau, Eluard, Picasso, 52. Bergamin was also responsible for 
safeguarding the artistic treasures of the Prado. The political opinions of 
Bergamin, who was a Catholic leftist, were to remain very influential for 
Picasso, as Roberto Otero, the photographer and nephew of Raphael 
Alberti, told me in our conversation. 

26. In 1932 Picasso had declared: "I will never make art with the precon- 
ceived idea of serving the interest of the political, religious, or military 
art of a country." He pointed out, however, what side he meant in this 
by adding: "I will never fit in with the followers of the prophets of 
Nietzsche's superman." Cited in Gert Schiff, ed. Picasso in Perspective 
(Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1976), 15; Dore Ashton, ed. 
Picasso on Art: A Selection of Views (New York: Viking Press, 1972), 148. 

27. The most comprehensive text on the Spanish Civil War is Hugh 
Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (London: Penguin Books, 1961; New 
York: Simon and Schuster, 1986). 

28. Letter, Javier Vilato to the author, 20January 1998. Although the foreign 
press continued to promote the myth of a united Popular Front, Picasso 
had ample opportunity to be informed of the dissentions. Vilato and his 
brother Fin had taken up arms against Franco by joining the militias in 
Barcelona. Christian Zervos was in Barcelona at the end of November 
1936, where he visited Picasso's family, and a close friend of Kahnweiler 
had enlisted in the left-wing militia under the legendary Buenaventura 
Durruti. On the events in Spain, see Thomas, Spanish Civil War, in 
particular, the chapter "Rising and Revolution," 19!) ff.; Francois Furet, 
Le Passe d'une illusion: Essai sur Videe communiste au XXe siecle (Paris: 
Robert Laffont/Calmann-Levy, 1995), "Communisme et antifascisme," 
in particular, 289-310. For the most detailed and fascinating firsthand 
account read George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia (New York: Harcourt 
Brace, 1952). 

29. We know of Picasso's sympathies for the radical left militias as, according 
to the surrealist poet Noel Arnaud, Picasso's financial support after the 
war would mainly help former militants of the militia organizations FAI 
(Federation anarquista iberica) and POUM (Partido obrero de unification 
marxista). Arnaud is cited in Michele Cone, Artists under Vichy: A Case of 
Prejudice and Persecution (Princeton, NJ.: Princeton LIniversity Press, 1992), 
152. The POUM was the group with which Orwell fought. Revolutionary 
in vocation and hostile to Stalinism, its members became the main target 
of Communist persecution; many were incarcerated and killed. On the 
Communists' hold on the Republican government in Valencia, see Furet, 
Le Passe, 25 I 59; Thomas, Spanish Civil War, 341, 452. 

30. Only the inclusion, in a sketch of 19 April 1937, of several raised fists 
holding Picasso's version of the Communist hammer and sickle, betrays 
a modicum of militant disposition. For publication ol those drawings sec 
Ludwig Ullmann, "Zur Vorgeschichte von Picasso's Guernica," Kritisch 
Bcnclii, 11, no. I (1986); 4-26. 

31. Gertrude Stein asserted that it was not really the events themselves as 
much as their happening in Spam that shook Picasso; in her Picasso

()(). In his review of the exhibition of contemporary Spanish art in the 

Galerie Charpentier in September 1942, the notorious Lucien Rebatet 
of the collaborationist Je suis partout made no secret of that fact. Lucien 
Rebatet, "L'Art espagnol contemporain,",/? suis partout, 9 September 
1942. See also Y. B.,"Une exposition d'artistes espagnols contemporains," 
Le Figaro, 18 August 1942;Jean-Marc Campagne, " L'Art espagnol con- 
temporain a la Galerie Charpentier," Les Nouveaux Temps, 30 September 
1942. As Steven Nash writes in his essay in this volume, the ban on 
exhibiting works by Picasso was not always respected. Andre Warnod, 
"Une exposition d'art espagnol," Le Figaro, 6 October 1942. On the 
Galerie Charpentier and its questionable dealings with the Germans 
during the Occupation, see Felicano, Lost Museum, 150-52. 

61. The exhibition was held at the Galerie Berri-Raspail. Picasso's participa- 
tion in this exhibition inspired at least one journalist to call Picasso ajew 
who was aping Negro art. See Henri Labroue, "La Peinture juive," Le 
Pilori, 27 May 1943: "ce juif livournais n'est qu'un singe de Part negre." 

62. R. T., "Une curieuse exposition rue Bonaparte," Aujourd'hui, 16 May 
1944. The exhibition was called L'Oeuvre el la palette, 1830 a nos jours. 

63. Brassai', Conversations, 69. 

64. Republished by Olivier Dussiau, "Requins et faisans de 1'edition," 
Union Francaise (Lyon), 6 October 1943, with the following commentary: 
"N'y-a-t-il pas la un des signes les plus eclatants de decadence literaire, 
spirituelle et morale." 

65. Petain believed that France's defeat was caused less by military conquest 
than by moral disintegration. 

66. The title was derived from a phrase by Rimbaud: "La main a plume 
vaut la main a charrue" (the hand at the quill is as valuable as the hand 
at the plough). The most exhaustive account of the Main a plume is in 
Faure, I'Histoire. 

67. Gilot and Lake, Life with Picasso, 46. 

68. See Andre-Louis Dubois, A trovers trois repuhliques: Sous le signe de I'amitie 
(Paris: Plon, 1972). On his help to Picasso, see Gilot and Lake, Life 
with Picasso, 44. On his friendship with Cocteau, see Cocteau, Journal 
1942-1945, passim. Dubois worked at the prefecture as director for the 
reconstruction of bombed areas. It was through the connections of his 
previous employment, as police chief of the Ministry of the Interior 
before Vichy fired him from that post, that he was able to help. Maurice 
Toesca, Cinq Ans de patience (1939-1945) (Paris: Editions Emile-Paul, 
1975). Toesca, whose work for Vichy was only a cover for his Resistance 
activities, was able to renew Picasso's identity papers in 1942 and 
can probably also be recognized as saving Picasso from being sent 

to Germany for work service. On Toesca, see also Cocteau, Journal, 
1942-1945, 196, passim; Pryce-Jones, Third Reich, 46-47. More famously, 
it was through Arno Breker's powerful connections and his friendship 
with Cocteau that Picasso and Cocteau "were spared the worst." See 
Cocteau, recollections in his Le Passe defini (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 
1983), 352. Cocteau had met Breker when the German sculptor lived 
in Paris as the student of Maillol. For more on their friendship, see 
Cocteau, Journal 1942-1945, 112, 125-28, 132, 133. Apparently Breker 
also protected Dina Vierny, the Jewish mistress of his old teacher 
Maillol; Pryce-Jones, Third Reich, 250. It is more than probable that 
Breker was also Picasso's mysterious source of bronze for the casting 
of his sculptures.

Intimate Portrait, trans. Angel Flores (New York: Prentice Hall, 1948) and 

Picasso, Retratosy recuerdos (Madrid: A. Aguado, 1953). This apparently 

simplistic little book has a lot to tell us about Picasso, neither indulgently 

nor hatefully. 

Zervos, "Conversations avec Picasso," 40. 

Guillaume Apollinaire, "L'adieu du cavalier," in Ombre de Mon Amour, 

poem 68, written on 20 September 1915: "Ah God! how pretty war is." 

(Geneva: Pierre Cailler, 1948). 

Picasso's situation in France could have become difficult if Franco, in 

Hendaye in October 1940, had allowed Hitler to move his troops across 

Spain to fight in North Africa, for Hitler might have given him some 

"lollipops" in exchange, such as Spanish Republicans who had taken 

refuge in France; but Franco had the sense to refuse. 

One must not lend credence to the "testimony" of Gerhard Heller, an 

intellectual snob and a minor underling who tended to claim, with much 

sentimentality and often nauseating "sensitivity," to have protected a lot 

of people, when in fact he was a simple bystander. See Gerhard Heller, 

Un Allemand a Paris: 1940-1944 (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1981). 

21. See Laurence Bertrand Dorleac, L'Art de la defaite, 1940-1944 (Paris: 
Editions du Seuil, 1993). 

22. I have often wondered just how this bronze was used in an "all-steel" 
war, but the Germans were master-salvagers. Maybe it was used to cast 
Arno Breker's supermen and superwomen? 

23. Clearly, the English had been so nasty to little Joan of Arc! The libretto 
was by Paul Claudel, the music by Arthur Honegger. 

24. But who knows? Picasso detested pain and suffering, and he had a ten- 
dency to burst into a kind of anger toward those who inflicted it on him. 

25. See Freud, passim, about gleichschwebende Aufmerksamkeit. 

26. Little Raymonde, a child adopted for a while by Fernande Olivier 
during the Demoiselles d' Avignon gestation, was around twelve years old, 
coming right out of a convent, and the studio was small. She must have 
hampered the lovemaking of the couple bv being, which is normal at 
that age, "all attention." Picasso drew her in his Demoiselles sketchbooks. 
Her curiosity brought back to him his peeping-tom nature as a small 
boy, and gave the original bordello the shape and impact we know: 
for curiosity is the sin in that painting. 

27. See W. Spies and C. Piot, Picasso: Das plastische Werk (Stuttgart: Gerd 
Hatje Verlag, 1983), nos. 409, 350, 463, respectively. 

28. See Marcel Proust, Le Temps retrouve, vol. 1 (Paris: NRF/Editions 
Gallimard, 1927), 33; he writes that when he thought he was looking at 
people, he was in fact X-raying them, whereas the Goncourt brothers 
were simply seeing their outside envelope and, so, could write 
"descriptions." 

29. Zervos XIII, 37. 

30. Zervos XIII, 67. It is just possible, however, that these two heads were 
inspired by the terrible photographs (the first ones) of the death camps, 
published in Defense de la France, 30 September 1943. This was a clandes- 
tine paper. The snapshots might have been shown to Picasso by some- 
one like Desnos; they are of Greek children and Russian prisoners.

34. Having, some ten years ago, been skimming through Mary Mathews 
Gedo, Picasso: Art as Autobiography (Chicago and London: University of 
Chicago Press, 1980), I noticed, after having written this obvious remark, 
that the author had written about the link between Guernica and the 
Malaga earthquake, but in another context. See page 181.

arose, although [he fear of llns disease was widespread at the time.

at the same time accurate, enlightening, and deeply original; wonderful, 
too, and tender, they are all written in simple words. The concepts of 
a "good-enough mother" and that of the capacity, for a baby, and then 
for the adult "to be alone in the presence of someone" are his. A good- 
enough mother is one who can adapt herself to the changing needs of 
a growing infant and child without intruding. Thus, an adult who never 
had the possibility, as a baby, of playing restfully under the evenly 
suspended attention of his mother will always be unhappv and will 
make other people unhappy, among other things. Moreover, the adult 
never had the "peace" necessary to be creative. His most famous 
book is Playing and Reality (London: Tavistock, 1971; see index for 
"mother" and "alone." 

The notion of the "intermediate space of Mothers" in Goethe has been 
much pondered and discussed for centuries, because it is somewhat 
nebulous. But artists seem to grasp it, in their own way. See, for example, 
Giovanni Segantini (1858-1899), Le catlive madn, 1894 (Osterreichische 
Galerie, Vienna), and II castigo delle lussuriose, 1891 (Kunsthaus Zurich); 
there are also, in Segantini's mountains around Maloja, some round and 
deep holes that are called "the wells of the Mothers." Hermann Broch 
made the notion somewhat clearer in his beautiful book. The Death of 
Virgil (trans. Jeanne Starr Untermayer [New York: Pantheon, 1945]). This 
was much later, as the book was written mostly at Princeton, at the end of 
his life. It seems that this notion is coming back "en force" in intellectual 
circles, perhaps because it can only be grasped obscurely, by poets 
and painters. Picasso, of course, did not know about it but he still had 
to endure the "intermediate space of the Mothers."

It is this "collage" and this lack of balance that twelve years ago 
plunged me into a study drowned in clouds of tobacco smoke, a la 
Sherlock Holmes. I had Degas in my head, and ended up finding 
the precise source.

de Hauck with Arts et Metiers Graphiques, 1946-1949), cat. no. 717. 
Picasso could have seen the work in Vollard's book, Degas, published by 
Cres in 1924, in Paris. He probably saw it again at the exhibition Degas, 
at the Orangerie, Paris, 1937, where it was lent by Durand-Ruel (no. 120). 
It was purely by chance that I discovered, while researching Degas, how 
Picasso's mother died, from a book borrowed from Maya Picasso and 
annotated by her: her father had sent her to spend a few months at his 
sister Lola's house in Barcelona, a house that had been the family home. 
Lola told Maya Picasso exactly what happened.

We must never forget that although Picasso's family did not regularly

during the first half of our century, nevertheless he had been brought 
up in nineteenth-centur) Spain. He was imbued with biblical history

Some Skirmishes over Picasso's Reputation

and are not essential sources for this text. I am especially grateful to 
Gertje Utley for sharing with me her research into the Picasso Archives,

sometimes abbreviated arguments in this essay. May we all live to fight 
another day.

In New York, Rosenberg held exhibitions of Picasso's work in February- 
March 1942, April and December 1943, February-March 1947, and 
March-April 1948. Pierre Matisse held an exhibition in December 1943. 

13. Vlaminck's denunciation first appeared in the Paris newspaper Comoedia 
(6June 1942) and was reprinted in Portraits avant deces (Paris: Flammarion, 
1943). Picasso kept a clipping of this article and referred to it when 
discussing the experience of the Occupation. In the 13 June issue of 
Comoedia, Andre Lhote offered a somewhat lukewarm defense of Picasso, 
and others supported him in the 20June issue. My thanks to Steven 
Nash for bringing this episode to my attention. 

14. Harriet and Sidney Janis, Picasso: The Recent Years 1939-1946 (New York: 
Doubleday, 1946), pi. 55. It is not clear whether these paintings were 
purchased during the war or in the months immediately following the 
Liberation. 

15. Martin Fabiani, Qiiandj'etais marchand dc tableaux (Paris:Julliard, 1976), 127. 

16. Hector Feliciano reports the aftermath of one transaction. During the 
war, Fabiani sold or traded a painting by the Douanier Rousseau to 
Picasso, after Picasso required a certificate from Fabiani stating that the 
picture was not illegally obtained. After the war, Picasso learned that the 
painting had been confiscated by the Nazis from Pierre Wertheimer and 
passed to Fabiani. The Lost Museum (New York: Basic Books, 1997), 121. 

17. The papers of Louis Carre's gallery are preserved in the French Archives 
Nationales. 

18. Gerhard Heller reported seeing some Picassos at Carre's gallery, but 
there is no evidence the dealer had a substantial stock during the war. 
Un Allemand a Paris: 1940-1944 (Pans: Editions du Seuil, 1981), 115. 

19. Auction records indicate the inflated prices in French francs paid for 
paintings during the war. For example, one of Picasso's paintings 
brought 610,000 francs at Drouot in early June 1942, and the sale of the 
Viau collection at Drouot on 12-13 December 1942 included a Picasso 
that sold for 1,610,000 and another for 1,300,000 francs. These prices are 
many times those reached at the peak of the pre-Depression market. As 
one example, in 1929 Viscount de Noailles bought a small Dinard paint- 
ing for 43,000 francs. Besides sales on the open market, extensive deal- 
ings were common in modern paintings confiscated by the Nazis from 
French citizens, primarily Jews such as Paul Rosenberg. In general, Nazi 
officials, such as Hermann Goring or Otto Abetz, requisitioned paintings 
by Picasso or his contemporaries without intending to keep them. They 
were to be sold on the international market (generally in Switzerland), 
or swapped with dealers or collectors for old-master pictures. These 
practices were thoroughly documented at the end of the war by James 
Plaut and Theodore Rousseau of the OSS Art Looting Unit. See my 
review of recent publications on this subject: "Nazi Esthetes," Art in 
America, February 1998, 33-35. 

20. For some of these exhibitions, see Steven Nash's chronology in this 
volume and Michele Cone, Artists under Vichy: A Case of Prejudice and 
Persecution (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992). 

21. The auction is discussed in Resolution nationale (18 July 1942). It was held 
by "LUnion des artistes," and Picasso's painting brought 650,000 francs. 

22. Roland Penrose was another deeply interested party. Although there are 
several notes from Penrose to Picasso during 1938-39 preserved in the 
Picasso Archives, there are none from late 1939 to mid- 1944. They 
resume with one dated 27 August 1944, in which Penrose wrote, "II me 
semble presque incroyable encore de pouvoir vous ecrire." My thanks to 
Steven Nash for bringing this correspondence to my attention.

Something has frightened [Picasso 's dove] badly. And it all happened in Korea. 
Uncle Joe sent tanks and planet and guru to th&lt; North Koreans and pointed 
them toward the south. It was not enough, so Uncle Joe sent for Picasso and 
said: "Corporal Picasso, to the rescue.' The North Koreans are collapsing.' 
Quick, a dove. " 

Picasso's dove is just coming back, and it is coming back as fast as its one wing 
can take it. The left wing, as anyone can plamh mi. bus ban hit. People who 
start a war and ay "Peace" are not Jit companions for man, beast, nor dove, 
even if they use the coo coo language, so the new dove is getting away fast. 

As Gertje UUey has carefully documented, a wide range of responses to 
Picasso's art existed among French critics after the w ar. Although Picasso 
probabK took very few of them seriously, conservative critics, who had 

ne\ er shown much s\ mpath) for his work, went so far as to accuse him 
of corrupting "pure" French cultural traditions. "Picasso and the French

10. Writing to Roland Penrose regarding Picasso's signing an open letter to

1956, Ban stated. "( )f course I am pleased that he signed the open letter
