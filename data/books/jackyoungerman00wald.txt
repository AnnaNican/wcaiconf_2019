New York, 1985 



When Jack Youngerman returned to the United States in 1956, he 
faced an art world very different from the one he knew as a young 
painter in Paris. There, the most compelling postwar art was, as he 
observed, a "soft kind of abstract impressionism" practiced by painters 
such as Jean Bazaine or, more important, a revivified geometric 
abstraction exemplified by the work of Auguste Herbin, Max Bill, 
Richard Lohse and other participants in the Salon des Realties 
Nouvelles. Youngerman also noted that "Neither was a direction for 
me. But that was what 1 found to relate to. So I ended up using hard- 
edge or Constructivist elements in a lyrical way in those early Paris 
paintings." 1 

Youngerman's early efforts, like those of Ellsworth Kelly, with 
whom he became friendly in 1948 when both attended the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts on the G.I. Bill, represent a young artist's assimilation of 
the then predominant Parisian modes of painting. Although few works 
remain from that period, extant examples (see fig. 1) already reveal 
Youngerman's predilection for frontality, flatness and simplicity - seen 
in bold and forthright imagery and uncomplicated color sequences - 
and for the embellishment of a relatively static, highly structured 
rectilinear composition with an occasional fanciful curve, irregular 
edge, asymmetrical thrust (see fig. 2). 

The initial experience of Paris was a heady one, for it brought 
Youngerman into his first real contact with art. During his residence 
there he encountered artists of his own generation, such as Cesar and 
Eduardo Paolozzi (like Kelly and himself, students at the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts), and such venerable masters as Constantin Brancusi and 
Jean Arp whose pioneering use of organic form offered a viable alter- 
native to geometric abstraction. When Youngerman began painting in 
Paris, he was not aware of artistic developments in the States. As he 
said, "I went straight from Kentucky to Paris by way of the Navy, be- 
cause in 1947 all the art schools in New York were full." 2 Because 
Youngerman had no artistic education prior to his training during and 
after the war, he was formed by his studies in Paris, his exposure to 
School of Paris painting and his travels to Italy, Spain, Greece, The 
Netherlands and Belgium. Fundamental to his development as well 
were travels in the Middle East in the mid-fifties: he visited and 
worked in Beirut, where his father-in-law Henri Seyrig was Director of 
the Institut Frangais d'Archeologie (Youngerman had married the 
actress Delphine Seyrig in 1950), and journeyed to Iraq, Syria, Jordan 
and Turkey. A fascination with the East continues to inform his art to

this day. Seyrig, a highly cultivated intellectual and connoisseur who 
later became Director of the Musees de France, helped to open up a 
new world of history, art, literature and philosophy for the young artist. 
Although he worked in what may be characterized as a highly for- 
malized geometric abstract style during his Paris period, Youngerman 
was also searching for other alternatives at this time. He frequented the 
Salon de Mai shows to see the most current Paris painting and sought 
out nineteenth-century Japanese woodcuts, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's 
posters, the woodcuts of Arp and Vasily Randinsky and Henri Matisse's 
ink drawings. Arp's woodcuts and ink drawings as well as Randinsky's 
abstract woodcuts were among the "...things that unlocked the door..." 
for Youngerman as "Shapes existing for themselves." 3 While Younger- 
man indicated an early appreciation of Arp, he did not fully explore the 
potential of Arp's spare biomorphic forms until he began to evolve his 
single image paintings in the late 1950s (see Black-Orange-Red Orange, 
1965, cat. no. 19). Matisse, on the other hand, offered Youngerman more 
immediate and direct inspiration. The silhouetted forms and expressive 
shapes of Matisse's drawings were particularly important for him: they 
dictated his own early attempts to freely render organic forms with 
emphatic positive/negative, figure/ground relationships (see fig. 3).

Matisse revealed to him the potentialities of shape, the possibilities of 
manipulating its contours and approaching it as flat plane or as volume. 
Furthermore, the simultaneous fullness and economy of Matisse's ink 
drawings, such as his depiction of pomegranates (fig. 4) in which he 
captured the lusciousness of the exotic fruit with highly simplified 
shapes and density of medium, attracted the younger artist. As Younger- 
man has explained: 

A black ink drawing by Matisse has a kind of starkness of a Mondrian. It is all in 
contrast. And that appealed to me very much. The clarity of it, the starkness of it, and 
the voluptuousness of it. This got me away from constructivist work. Those Matisse 
drawings lead almost immediately to a certain number of things that I started doing 
using what you could call organic shapes. Which for me is the basis of my work. 4 

He saw in these drawings, and in the woodcuts of Arp and Kandinsky, far 
greater freedom and spontaneity than in the then much acclaimed new 
French painting. 

At Betty Parsons's urging, Youngerman decided to return to the 
States in 1956. During his first years in Paris he had felt liberated and 
open to the experience of living and working abroad. Now, however, he 
was estranged from the insular French art world (he could not relate to 
Tachisme, then the rage in Paris) and no longer relished the role of

expatriate. Upon his arrival in New York, Youngerman settled with his 
wife and infant son Duncan at Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan; there 
his neighbors and friends included Kelly as well as Jasper Johns, Robert 
Indiana, Agnes Martin, Fred Mitchell, Robert Rauschenberg and Barnett 
Newman. He was instantly propelled from the obscurity and isolation he 
had known in Paris into a highly-charged milieu of painters who were 
forging new directions for American art. Nothing he had encountered in 
the art world in Paris could have prepared him for the revolution that 
had taken place in painting in New York. Although the aggressive post- 
ure of Abstract Expressionism would seem to be at odds with a sensibil- 
ity shaped by geometric abstraction, the rugged forms, vibrant color and 
large scale of much New York School painting had an immediate impact 
on the young artist. 

Among the first paintings in which Youngerman gave expression to 
his new direction are Red White, 1958, and Ram, 1959 (cat. nos. 2,3). As 
Youngerman has explained, it was not the jagged edges or knifed im- 
pasto that most impressed him about New York School painting, for he 
had already incorporated such elements into his Parisian painting (see 
fig. 5). Rather it was the massing of forms, inspired by the examples of 
Clyfford Still and Robert Motherwell, that had the greatest impact on 



15 



his work. At this time the big shape and the two- or three-color re- 
lationship became the crucial elements in his painting; they play a 
major role in his work to date. Although they are harbingers of a new 
direction, Red White, Ram and other works of the period reveal 
Youngerman's capacity to expand upon his Parisian experience 
through the medium of the new American painting. In these paintings 
of the late 1950s and early 1960s he continued to explore the qualities 
that most impressed him in Matisse's drawings - their simultaneous 
starkness and voluptuousness - thereby fully expressing his own pre- 
dilection for spare economical form without sacrificing his innate 
feeling for drama and opulence. 

The work of other artists notably influenced Youngerman's de- 
velopment at this time: the dark brooding paintings of Albert Pinkham 
Ryder, which were much admired by young American artists during 
the late 1950s; the emblematic and enigmatic imagery and bold inci- 
sive color of Marsden Hartley; and the resonant organic forms and 
abstraction based upon nature of Arthur Dove and Georgia O'Reeffe. 
As diverse as these painters are, they share much in common, in par- 
ticular a vision that transcends nature without entirely relinquishing 
its outward forms. 

Youngerman and his colleagues in New York were keenly aware 
of their roles as American artists and of America's place on the stage 
of world history. Whereas this awareness led artists such as Johns or 
Indiana to turn to American Pop culture for clearly identifiable 
symbols of present-day American life, it encouraged Youngerman, as 
well as Kelly, to look to earlier generations of American artists as a 
source of imagery. In the work of O'Reeffe, for example in paintings 
such as Rlue and Green Music, 1919, and Black Place III, 1944 (figs. 6, 
7), Youngerman found a distinctly American precedent for the organic 
imagery, the form, volume and color he had earlier admired in Euro- 
pean and Middle Eastern art. Youngerman shares with O'Reeffe a 
concern with nature-related forms. Their attitudes are distinct, how- 
ever, in that Youngerman seeks a universal, generalized abstract 
image rather than the particularized organic shape through which 
O'Reeffe conveys a sense of an underlying rhythm and of the totality of 
life. As O'Reeffe has remarked: 

There are people who have made me see shapes - and others I thought of a great 
deal, even people I have loved, who make me see nothing. I have painted portraits 
that to me are almost photographic. I remembered hesitating to show the paintings, 
they looked so real to me. But they have passed into the world as abstractions - no 
one seeing what they are. 5

For O'Keeffe, the depiction of recognizable natural forms and abstrac- 
tion are, if not synonymous, at the very least closely linked; they are 
two ways of representing reality. For Youngerman, on the other hand, 
the world of objects is too specific, too loaded with history and associa- 
tions; although he occasionally sketches from nature, he prefers to 
uncover the laws of form that underlie organic life and yield a 
geometry of nature. 

Black plays a pivotal role in Youngerman's paintings of the late 
1950s and early 1960s. Among his most successful canvases are those 
in which black and red, black and orange or black and yellow forms 
are combined to produce an intense color experience, which is 
enhanced by the use of formidable shapes and highly articulated sur- 
faces (see cat. nos. 4,6,7). Although O'Keeffe's explorations of color and 
her pronounced use of black have been highly significant, Younger- 
man has not remarked on her influence on him in this regard. He has, 
however, acknowledged his indebtedness to both Still and Motherwell 
for their masterful use of black - perhaps because their impact upon 
artists of Youngerman's generation was more immediate than that of 
O'Keeffe and other painters of her time. Youngerman's own use of 
black differs from that of the artists of either earlier generation.

Where O'Keeffe was concerned with black as it exists in nature, the 
New York School artists such as Still, Newman or Mark Rothko 
explored it as a vehicle for transcendental experience. Youngerman, 
on the other hand, in a quest as meaningful as that of his predeces- 
sors, has investigated the blackness of black. 

Despite Youngerman's affinity for many elements of American 
abstract painting as it developed in the 1950s, he did not share with 
the artists of the first generation of the New York School their commit- 
ment to the expansive field of the monumental canvas. Whereas the 
contrast between contained form and boundless field is an essential 
feature of the work of Still, Newman and Motherwell, for Youngerman 
the successful resolution of shape and integration of forms depends 
upon a sense of a finite, limited field. Thus, although Youngerman has 
worked on a large scale, his canvases are rarely oversized. Cropping 
of shapes became an important device for him, serving both to tie the 
image to the field and to expand the space within the painting. Indeed, 
Youngerman's concern with active and passive shapes, be they figure 
or ground, demands a specific scale; interior shape determines 
external size. For both the cropping of shape and the meshing of one 
form with another, Youngerman looked to the example of Still. Paint- 
ings by Still such as 1950-ANo. 2, 1950 (fig. 8), provided precedent for 
Youngerman's handling of these features in Black-Red of 1959 (cat. no. 
6) and other works, although the latter's rounded forms are markedly 
different from Still's nervous, ragged-edged shapes. Comparison of 
Youngerman's Aztec III of 1959 (cat. no. 5), with Still's 1957-D No. /, 
1957 (fig. 9), underscores Youngerman's preference for voluptuous 
form and also reveals differences in paint handling: Youngerman's 
heavy impasto remains fluid and graceful despite its density, while 
Still's surface is as agitated as the ultimately fugitive forms it defines. 

While color and surface were and continue to be of crucial con- 
cern to Youngerman, invented shape has always been the fundamen- 
tal element in his work: he is above all interested in a dominant form, 
which may be either figure or ground. As he has stated: 



... the whole primary thing 1 work with in my paintings is an exploration and 
articulation of all the possibilities of abstract shape as opposed to the shape of 
things and as opposed to geometric work where you work with pre-existing 
shapes. It is the invention of form that I am involved with. 6 

In the same interview Youngerman also noted that after he articulates 
his form, he establishes value and then the sequence of colors. Else- 
where he has commented: 



19 




Values are usually the determining factor in my choice of colors. 1 think in 
terms of values first, which are then translated into colors; maximum contrast is 
a frequent occupation. Looking through "JAZZ" by Matisse, I realized that even 
though every plate had black or white or both in them, you don't think of black 
and white at all, but of the other colors. 1 almost always need black or white, 
often both, as components of 2 or 3-color paintings. My wish for maximum 
contrasts corresponds to the tension I want to create in the opposition of passive 
and active shapes. Shapes demand their own colors. You can't put any color on 
any shape, particularly organic shapes. Some shapes can take more than one 
color but none can take any color. But the emotional value of my shapes means 
that, for example, a dramatic menacing shape will often require black. You can't 
paint it blue, yellow or green. I might try out different combinations in color 
studies until the right one imposes itself. White for me is really involved with 
space, a sense of breadth. 7 

In 1959-60 Youngerman was included in his first major museum 
exhibition, Sixteen Americans, organized by The Museum of Modern 
Art in New York. A comparison of paintings by Youngerman (Aztec III, 
1959 [cat. no. 5]), Frank Stella (The Marriage of Reason and Squalor, 
1959 [fig. 10]), Johns (White Target, 1958 [fig. 11]) and Kelly (Falcon, 
1959 [fig. 12]), all included in the show, makes the similarities and, 
more important, the differences between Youngerman and his col- 
leagues abundantly clear. Although these artists necessarily shared

certain attitudes in that they helped to create New York School paint- 
ing of the late 1950s - a style as loosely defined and as varied as that 
established earlier by Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz 
Kline, Newman, Rothko and Still - their aesthetic goals were ulti- 
mately singular. With Kelly, Youngerman shares a common schooling 
in Paris, a predilection for geometric abstraction, simplified shape and 
restricted color arrangements; he and Johns have a similar feeling for 
value and impasto; he and Stella are linked by their commitment to 
the large and commanding image Youngerman relates to Still and 
Kline. Youngerman shares with Kelly a pronounced feeling for shape, 
but his form is closer to that of Johns's circular target than to Kelly's 
configuration. Although both Youngerman and Kelly value flatness, 
the volatility of Youngerman's fragmented shape relates to the flicker- 
ing pattern established by Johns's brushwork. The static nature of 
Kelly's configuration links it to Stella's quiescent image, while the 
internal composition of Stella's painting bears similarities to the con- 
centric rings of Johns's target. The Stella and the Johns are most 
significantly related, however, in terms of the iconic, emblematic 
quality of their imagery and in the ironic commentary on the nature of 
painting as object. For Youngerman and Kelly, on the other hand, the 



21 



literary aspects of this dialogue are inconsequential compared to the 
purely painterly values of abstract form and color. 

Because Youngerman and Kelly share a common history and an 
avowed commitment to abstract form and color, viewers have con- 
tinued to perceive their painting as closely related. Yet their art issues 
from different attitudes, different perceptions, different choices. 
Although both Kelly and Youngerman work with organic forms that 
have some resemblance to natural forms, it would appear that Kelly's 
images, both in his plant drawings and his abstract paintings, relate 
more directly to their sources in the objective world than do Younger- 
man's. Kelly has said: 

I like to work from things that I see whether they're man-made or natural or a 
combination of the two. Once in a while I work directly from something I've 
seen, like a window, or a fragment of a piece of architecture, or someone's legs; 
or sometimes the space between things, or just how the shadows of an object 
would look. The idea of the shadow of a natural object has existed, like the 
shadow of the pyramids, or a rock and its shadow; I'm not interested in the 
texture of the rock, or that it is a rock but in the mass of it, and its shadow. 8 

Stressing his belief in "shapes existing for themselves" rather than as 
reminders of nature, Youngerman has described his own working 
method and rather more distant relationship to the perceived world: 

I start out with lots of little ink drawings They're like shorthand notes. I do 

them rapidly, save them, go back to them, modify them, perhaps use them in the 
future. I use lots of sources for provoking these drawings. Any number of 
diverse visual impressions or combinations might serve me as a point of depar- 
ture for generating new shapes the origin of the paintings is almost never 

directly in things seen. I've nothing against it, but nature doesn't furnish me 
with "subjects." I can invent a much greater variety of shapes that I can use 
than I could ever get from observation. If sometimes people see "references" in 
my work, it is perhaps because the mind works to suggest some familiar image 
in any new shape. 9 

Youngerman's allusive titles enlarge upon the references made by the 
shapes, surfaces and color of his images. These titles may refer to 
seasons, places or states of mind, evoking, together with his imagery, 
multiple and ever-changing possibilities. 

Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s Youngerman elabo- 
rated upon the potential of abstract form. He was careful to avoid the 
depiction of objects, preferring instead to cultivate deliberately 
ambiguous imagery. This allowed him to attempt to convey the sensa- 
tions of natural phenomena - of heat and light, for example - and to 
shape his perceptions into vivid and concrete imagery. Youngerman's 



22 



receptivity to such phenomena was undoubtedly heightened by the 
sensations he experienced upon his move to New York. As he recalled: 

When I came back to America the first thins I noticed was on the boat coming 
back - the first American thing that I had forgotten. I [saw] ... all of a sudden on 
the bulkhead, which was painted white, this absolutely dazzling white light. We 
were in the Atlantic maybe a day or two out from America. And the light, the 
changes of light was the thing. I had gotten so conditioned to the kind of Paris 
ligbt which is the hazy poetic sort of golden light when it is a good day, this He 
de France light. I had forgotten completely what American light was, and seeing 
that all of a sudden ... it was like a real American experience, and I'm back. 10 

In general, during the 1960s Youngerman continued to concern 
himself with the ideas that had engaged him in the late 1950s. How- 
ever, in this period, the heavily scumbled surfaces, rugged forms and 
biting colors of his paintings evolved into smoother contours, flatter 
surfaces, more varied color relationships. Although he continued to 
use black, it no longer dominated his canvases, and the inflected, 
interrupted line that had enclosed his forms was less often in evi- 
dence. White was introduced to complement such colors as blue, red 
and yellow. His broad, freely rendered forms now contained sweeping, 
open curves. Already intense colors such as black and red brightened 
further, and, as the paint surface smoothed out, hugged the canvas 
surface more closely. There is a new lightness and openness of shape 
and of contour. Paintings such as Black, Red, and Hliite, 1962, Delfina 
II, 1964, June 1965 and BlueUTiite-Red, both 1965 (cat. nos. 15, 17, 20, 
22), possess a lyrical expansiveness absent from the more densely 
impacted earlier work. While paintings such as Long March II, 1964, 
and Black-Orange-Red Orange, 1965 (cat. nos. 18, 19), are close in feel- 
ing to the work of the preceding decade, most of the painting of the 
1960s reveals a new and entirely confident sense of the decorative 
possibilities of abstract painting. 

Youngerman's abiding interest in Eastern art and culture inspired 
a series of folding linen or wood screens which he began in the late 
1970s. In screens such as Fire-Orange, 1978, and High Tide, 1979 (cat. 
nos. 30, 31), the roughness and opulence of his earlier work is mod- 
ified by the mediation of Eastern examples. The exquisiteness and 
finesse, the refined form and color, the sense of serenity and order 
present in the Oriental prototypes for these screens appear here fil- 
tered through a personal, Western sensibility. Thus the imagery of the 
screens may recall Braque's birds or Hokusai's wave - apparently 
disparate sources in which the artist sees a similar organic form. 



23 



Youngerman extended the idiom of the screen into the medium of 
painted aluminum sculpture in 1980. The point of departure for works 
such as Tabriz, 1980 (cat. no. 40), is the format of the hinged screen. A 
screen, by its very nature, conceals; the oriental screen and Younger- 
man's linen or wood screens as well convey a sense of fragility and 
ephemerality. In the metal examples, Youngerman plays upon ideas of 
concealing and revealing by cutting out shapes in the material. 
Moreover, by piercing the metal he is able to express fragility without 
denying the distinctive physical properties of the medium. 

Certain of the works in metal represent a progression away from 
the screen format into the realm of freestanding sculpture. For exam- 
ple, HokusaVs Wave, 1981 (cat. no. 41), retains the planarity and 
pierced surface of works such as Tabriz, but its image is no longer 
contained by the screen's rectangle. Pictorial elements such as color 
are purged, yet the sculpture continues to share the images of the 
painting and works on paper. 

In his paintings of the mid-1960s, Youngerman created an intrigu- 
ing tension between two- and three-dimensionality by using forms of 
heavily built-up impasto whose volume is suppressed through their 
integration with the flat picture plane. In Untitled (Black-Yellow-Red), 
of 1963 (cat. no. 17), for example, the dominant shape is so thickly 
painted that it appears to be in low relief, but its three dimensionality 
is restrained by the embracing yellow form nestled within the larger 
black shape on the red ground of the painting. The volumetric shapes 
in these paintings, which reappear in sculptural form in Youngerman's 
painted reliefs of the 1980s, are reminiscent of the configurations in Arp's 
reliefs. 

A turning point for the artist was marked in 1970, for it was then that 
he began to work with circular and elliptical canvases. To be sure, he 
had executed several diamond-shaped paintings in the late 1960s, includ- 
ing Bahia, 1967, and Black Diamond, 1969 (cat. nos. 24, 25), in which a 
symmetrical interior image reinforces the external configuration of the 
canvas. Starting in 1970, however, he elaborated upon his experiments 
with shaped canvases. In the new works, such as Roundabout, 1970, and 
Sagaponack, 1971 (cat. nos. 27, 28), Youngerman at once acknowledged 
and controverted the shape of the support with the interior image: the 
configuration of the internal image echoes that of the support, but it is 
placed so that the two shapes are no longer parallel. 

In 1970, concurrent with the production of the oval and elliptical 
canvases, Youngerman began to make freestanding sculpture in lami- 



24

nated fiberglas and resin. Certainly, his decision to work in three 
dimensions arose from his compelling interest in shape. In a revealing 
comment of 1966, he indicated his concern with volume as it related to 
his painting. He spoke of "forms that have volume from the beginning, 
as opposed to lines that circumscribe shape."" 

That Youngerman began to produce oval and elliptical canvases, 
screens and freestanding sculpture testifies to his ambition to confront 
shape in a new and innovative way. Youngerman's sculpture has been 
central to this development. The sculpture, like his paintings, is or- 
ganic in its point of origin; it evokes a subtle eroticism based on ob- 
lique references to male and female forms and calls up associations 
with nature and the art of other cultures and other times. The familiar 
curved forms of his paintings took on new and provocative meanings 
when they were translated into three dimensions in the first sculpture 
as, for example, in Andromeda, 1975 (fig. 13). However, Youngerman 
had not worked fully in the round before 1970, and a prolonged period 
of trial and error was necessary before he was able to achieve the 
completely evolved works of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although 
they were well-conceived, the first sculptures lacked fullness. 
Moreover, Youngerman had not yet developed an entirely satisfactory 



25 



working method. Once he began to cast his fiberglas, in 1977, how- 
ever, he could address the aesthetic problems of the earlier pieces. At 
this point he was able to produce fully resolved sculpture that retained 
the freshness and vitality of the first three-dimensional works. 

The freestanding sculptures consist of forms molded into simple 
shapes. In their grace, ease and casualness they are reminiscent of 
traditional Japanese folded and twisted paper. Their seeming ef- 
fortlessness belies a lengthy working process that the artist refers to 
as "the lost polyurethane method." He twists sheets of polyurethane 
into elaborate curves which he wires, staples or holds together with 
bolsters. Working with Christopher Janney, Youngerman sprays the 
finished shape with molten metal and encases it in a fiberglas mold. 
After the spongy inner form is pulled out of the mold, Youngerman 
replaces it with sprayed resin and fiberglas. He achieves the final state 
of the piece by fine-tuning it after the casting. To date Youngerman 
has restricted the freestanding sculptures to either black or white. 
Although the same forms are used in the black and white sculptures, 
the matte finish of the former and the translucent surfaces of the latter 
produce strikingly different effects. 

Beginning in 1980, Youngerman created a new body of works 
which he has called "relief paintings." In some of these reliefs of oil, 
epoxy, polystyrene and fiberglas he recapitulates in three dimensions 
elements of the formal vocabulary of his earlier paintings, folding 
screens and enamel and steel sculpture. In others he extends his rep- 
ertory of images to include provocative new shapes. Whereas the 
freestanding sculptures are limited to black and white, the reliefs are 
characterized by complex color relationships that cannot adequately 
be conveyed in reproduction and so must be experienced directly. 
Indeed, the seemingly evanescent white pieces, glistening with a lus- 
ter like fine pearls, and the sleek black sculptures stand in marked 
contrast to the dramatically colored rough-surfaced reliefs. The quiet, 
contained shapes of the cast-fiberglas sculptures, too, are at variance 
with the restless forms of the reliefs. The intricate carving in the re- 
liefs, which must be viewed from many different positions, enhances 
form as well as color and also speaks of the concern for value that was 
evident in Youngerman's earliest work. 

The graceful sweeping curves of early reliefs such as Swirl II and 
Red Huracan, both 1981 (cat. nos. 33, 34), were replaced by jagged 
configurations in later examples such as Lykos, 1983, and Apollyon, 
1984 (cat. nos. 36, 37). The latter reliefs represent, in respect to their 



26 



contours as well as the way small forms embrace or intercept larger 
ones, a return to considerations of Youngerman's painting of the mid- 
sixties. However, the notched and silhouetted forms familiar from the 
earlier paintings are more assertive here by virtue of their three di- 
mensionality and because they are no longer contained by the quies- 
cent shape of the canvas rectangle. Thus, in these new works, 
Youngerman refines and expands upon his earlier experiments, con- 
tinuing his dialogue with the expressive potential of shape. 

Throughout his career Youngerman has depended upon drawings, 
which he has produced in voluminous quantities. They have served as 
notations for ideas or as sketches for painting and sculpture and also 
as independent works of art. Often minute, they may be enlarged into 
working drawings. The same evolution that occurs in the painting and 
sculpture unfolds in the works on paper. An examination of the 
sketches indicates that each shape in the finished works in other 
mediums is as carefully considered as the choice of color that comple- 
ments it. Even the drawings that serve as the models for painting or 
sculpture preserve their own integrity. Thus, March 23, 1965, II, 1965, 
or September 3, 1966, 1966 (cat. nos. 49, 48), are clearly studies, yet 
stand alone on their own merits: they reveal in their proportions, 
shapes and density of pigment the qualities of starkness, economy and 
voluptuousness Youngerman admired years ago in Matisse's drawings. 
Recently Youngerman has begun to execute drawings that are meant 
to exist as independent works. Among them are two untitled works of 
1980 and Halo/Blue, 1981 (cat. nos. 53-55), in which he has taken full 
advantage of the medium, allowing the circular shapes in his hand- 
embossed paper to dictate the configurations of the drawings. The 
lyricism of these examples has been supplanted by a more volatile 
feeling in the most recent drawings (see cat. nos. 56-59), which are 
models for a new series of large works. 

Throughout his career Youngerman has been concerned with 
both the structure and the expressive potentialities of organic shape. 
The language of organic form he has evolved is at once dynamic and 
serene: the artist says that "these configurations proceed from the 
'world field of stress' with all its tension, compression, and release, 
much as do organic forms themselves." 12 Highly inventive, issuing 
from his dialogue with the world, his imagery is never derivative. 
Youngerman's generalized, universal forms are reductive yet create a 
rich and complex fabric. His dialogue is a vital and continuing process 
which for him has hardly begun.
